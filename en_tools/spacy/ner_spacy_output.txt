<br /><br />I started watching the show in reruns in 2001	[('2001', 391)]
<br /><br />I enjoy the show but it had too many faults	[]
<br /><br />I HATE THE MICHELLE & JOEY CHARACTERS!<br /><br />Stealing story lines from old TV shows	[]
They even stole from "The Partirdge Family	[('The Partirdge Family', 388)]
" Then in 1 episode "The Partridge Family" was mentioned	[('1', 397), ('The Partridge Family', 388)]
<br /><br />Actors playing different roles in different episodes	[]
MTV Martha Quinn the most notable doing this, especially when she played herself in 1 episode	[('MTV Martha Quinn', 380), ('1', 397)]
<br /><br />The Michelle character COULD NOT take a joke but then they had this little kid act out "revenge" to her sisters for a joke by them on her	[('Michelle', 380), ('COULD', 383)]
<br /><br />Story lines that came & went in 1 episode	[('1', 397)]
Joey getting the TV show with Frankie & Annette, never heard from it again after that	[('Joey', 380), ('Frankie & Annette', 383)]
1 episode he is coaching soccer, 1 episode he is coaching softball/baseball	[('1', 397), ('1', 397)]
1 game & you are out huh Danny? <br /><br />Jesse & Joey keep getting jobs REALLY QUICKLY with no experience	[('1', 397), ('Danny', 380), ('Joey', 380), ('REALLY QUICKLY', 380)]
Wish Jodie Sweetin could have learned from Candace Cameron Bure & had a clean NON drug adult life	[('Jodie Sweetin', 380), ('Candace Cameron Bure &', 383), ('NON', 383)]
It is a realistic depiction of rural ranching life which was a big part of American History	[('American', 381)]
The setting is 1906 Wyoming where life had not changed much since the previous century	[('1906', 391), ('Wyoming', 384), ('the previous century', 391)]
The film keeps your interest without the added Hollywood myths	[('Hollywood', 384)]
The whole family can see this movie and be intrigued about how life was like in America when it was mostly a rural nation	[('America', 384)]
With this film, you will escape the present and witness the daily life of 100 years ago	[('daily', 391), ('100 years ago', 391)]
In a beautiful, scenic environment you will see the hard physical work that was required to survive, as well as the constant worries and concerns of the elements and the market pressures that will make a difference between success or failure	[]
See this movie and experience life as it was for most of our nation's history	[]
My only question is - why aren't there more films like this one	[]
If you are viewing this show for the first time, you may start wondering if you are in an alternate reality	[('first', 396)]
Colorful and imaginative characters? Entertaining dialogue? Plots that seem to have some depth to them, even creating atmospheres of suspense and drama at times? I mean, this is a syndicated children's show right? This is the same venue that has brought kids such drek as "Pokemon", "Pepper Ann", "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers", and "VR Troopers" (please note that three of the titles mentioned above are crass Japanese exports, courtesy of the Fox Network and Saban Entertainment)	[('Pokemon', 388), ('Pepper Ann', 388), ('Mighty Morphin Power Rangers', 388), ('VR Troopers', 388), ('three', 397), ('Japanese', 381), ('the Fox Network and Saban Entertainment', 383)]
Don't worry, you are just sampling some of the quality fare that was available to kids during the late 1980's and early 1990's	[('1980', 391), ('1990', 391)]
Some examples of this period would be "Transformers", "Garfield and Friends", "Captain Power", and "C	[('Garfield', 380), ('Friends', 383), ('Captain Power', 388)]
" (a cartoon NOT to be confused with the live action show on Fox)	[('Fox', 383)]
Besides these prime examples, Disney also returned to syndicated programs for kids, coming up with a lineup called "The Disney Afternoon"	[('Disney', 383), ('The Disney Afternoon', 388)]
Aside from a dumbed-down show called "The Gummi Bears", early shows like "Darkwing Duck", "Duck Tales", and "Chip 'N Dale's Rescue Rangers" gave credence to the Disney animation teams that were also turning out theatrical classics like "The Little Mermaid", "Beauty and the Beast", "The Rescuers Down Under", and "The Great Mouse Detective"	[('The Gummi Bears', 388), ('Darkwing Duck', 388), ('Duck Tales', 388), ("Chip 'N Dale's Rescue Rangers", 388), ('Disney', 383), ('The Little Mermaid', 388), ('Beauty and the Beast', 388), ('The Rescuers Down Under', 388), ('The Great Mouse Detective', 388)]
But above all these wonders shines "TaleSpin"	[('TaleSpin', 388)]
The premiere of "Plunder and Lightning" was a two-hour thrill ride, and won an Emmy	[('Plunder and Lightning', 388), ('two-hour', 392)]
Much to my delight, the rest of the episodes were up to par on the promise of the premiere	[]
<br /><br />While I enjoy the plots and dialogue, I guess for me the greatest attraction are the characters	[]
There's Rebecca Cunningham, an independent female, but still fallible; Kit Cloudkicker, full of pre-teen angst and optimism; Louie, with his loyalty and support; Frank Wildcat, the most entertaining engineer since Scotty on the original "Star Trek"; Molly Cunningham, cute and witty, but with some depth that most child characters don't have, and of course in the middle of it all, there's Baloo, whom I would describe as a slobby version of James Bond	[('Rebecca Cunningham', 380), ('Kit Cloudkicker', 380), ('Louie', 380), ('Frank Wildcat', 380), ('Scotty', 384), ('Star Trek', 388), ('Molly Cunningham', 380), ('Baloo', 383), ('James Bond', 380)]
This is because whenever there's trouble, Baloo saves the day with the assistance of his sleeker-than-most, fastest-of-all Sea Duck (Read: James Bond's Aston Martin)	[('the day', 391), ("James Bond's", 380), ('Aston Martin', 380)]
Of course every great show has to have great villains, and TaleSpin doesn't disappoint here either	[('TaleSpin', 383)]
From the megalomania of businesstiger Shere Kahn, to the vain and always failing air pirate Don Karnage, to the hilarious and inept Soviet-satirized Thembrians	[('Shere Kahn', 380), ('Don Karnage', 380), ('Soviet', 381), ('Thembrians', 381)]
The animation is good, the music appropriate, and the episodes are (for me) the finest that children's programming has ever had to offer	[]
As did others in this forum, when "Fobidden Planet" was offered in 1956, I rushed to see it	[('Fobidden Planet', 388), ('1956', 391)]
This story is an interesting phenomenon I suggest because young, old, male, female, sci-fi experts and people who find such fare 'way out" all can follow and enjoy this film's story and plot lines very well	[]
This is the first movie set on a planet other than Earth in the 20th Century other than serials such as "Flash Gordon"	[('first', 396), ('Earth', 385), ('the 20th Century', 391), ('Flash Gordon', 388)]
Leslie Nielsen was vocally a bit weak for his role, at that time, but Walter Pigeon, Marvin Miller, Anne Francis, Richard Anderson, Earl Holliman and especially Warren Stevens all acquitted themselves very well	[('Leslie Nielsen', 380), ('Walter Pigeon', 380), ('Marvin Miller', 380), ('Anne Francis', 380), ('Richard Anderson', 380), ('Earl Holliman', 380), ('Warren Stevens', 380)]
There are so many visual splendors in this one, it's hard to choose a favorite from the film's scenes	[]
The approach to Altair-4, the starship itself, the landing on the planet's alien surface, the descent via extensor stairs, the first view of the landscape, the approach of the rocket-sled, Dr	[('first', 396)]
Morbius's house seen from without and from within, the underground complex and its wonders, the setup of the weaponry, the battle with the monster, the final approach of the unseen destroyer,the escape from the doomed planet--all these scenes are etched into the viewer's mind because we discover them along with the participants	[('Morbius', 383)]
Veteran Cyril Hume's literate script was filmed intelligently by long-time director Fred McLeod Wilcox with clarity and imagination	[('Cyril Hume', 380), ('Fred McLeod Wilcox', 380)]
it is a shock to realize there's no music at all; the film is carried by the words, the actors and the mystery-revelation storyline	[]
It can be watched again and again with pleasure--I have been doing so for nearly fifty years	[('nearly fifty years', 391)]
Until this famous and well-loved film was created, no film had tried to imagine a world beyond Earth; and for decades afterward, ships kept crashing back on the planet--as if the writers' imaginations were failing and causing the crashes	[('Earth', 385), ('decades', 391)]
That says something negative about this nation's so-called intellectual leaders' imaginations--and something very positive indeed I suggest about those who made this gem	[]
The funky, yet strictly second-tier British glam-rock band Strange Fruit breaks up at the end of the wild'n'wacky excess-ridden 70's	[('second', 396), ('British', 381), ("wild'n'wacky", 385), ('70', 391)]
The individual band members go their separate ways and uncomfortably settle into lackluster middle age in the dull and uneventful 90's: morose keyboardist Stephen Rea winds up penniless and down on his luck, vain, neurotic, pretentious lead singer Bill Nighy tries (and fails) to pursue a floundering solo career, paranoid drummer Timothy Spall resides in obscurity on a remote farm so he can avoid paying a hefty back taxes debt, and surly bass player Jimmy Nail installs roofs for a living	[('90', 397), ('Stephen Rea', 380), ('Bill Nighy', 380), ('Timothy Spall', 380), ('Jimmy Nail', 380)]
Former loving groupie turned patient, understanding, long-suffering manager Juliet Aubrey gets the group back together for an ill-advised, largely ineffectual and hilariously disastrous twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of Europe	[('Juliet Aubrey', 380), ('twenty years later', 391), ('Europe', 385)]
Our lovably ragged bunch try gamely, but fumblingly to reignite a flame that once burned quite brightly back in the day	[('the day', 391)]
Scraggly zonked-out roadie Billy Connelly and cocky eager beaver young guitarist Hans Matheson tag along for the delightfully bumpy, trouble-plagued, but still ultimately rewarding and enjoyable ride	[('Billy Connelly', 380), ('Hans Matheson', 380)]
<br /><br />Director Brian Gibson shows tremendously infectious respect and adoration for both his amiably screwy characters in particular and loud, ringing, flamboyantly overblown preening 70's rock in general, this imbuing this affectionate little pip with an utterly engaging sense of big-hearted charm and tireless verve	[('Brian Gibson', 380), ('70', 397)]
The astute, sharply written script by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais likewise bristles with spot-on dry wit and finely observed moments of joyous on the road inanity, capturing a certain bittersweetly affecting and frequently uproarious vibe that gives the picture itself an irresistibly luminescent glow	[('Dick Clement', 380), ('Ian La Frenais', 380)]
Ashley Rowe's lovely, elegant cinematography ensures that the movie always looks quite visually sumptuous while the perfectly catchy and groovy music does the trick with right-on rockin' flair and aplomb	[("Ashley Rowe's", 380)]
