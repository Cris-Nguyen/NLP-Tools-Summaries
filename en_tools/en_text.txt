<br /><br />I started watching the show in reruns in 2001
<br /><br />I enjoy the show but it had too many faults
<br /><br />I HATE THE MICHELLE & JOEY CHARACTERS!<br /><br />Stealing story lines from old TV shows
They even stole from "The Partirdge Family
" Then in 1 episode "The Partridge Family" was mentioned
<br /><br />Actors playing different roles in different episodes
MTV Martha Quinn the most notable doing this, especially when she played herself in 1 episode
<br /><br />The Michelle character COULD NOT take a joke but then they had this little kid act out "revenge" to her sisters for a joke by them on her
<br /><br />Story lines that came & went in 1 episode
Joey getting the TV show with Frankie & Annette, never heard from it again after that
1 episode he is coaching soccer, 1 episode he is coaching softball/baseball
1 game & you are out huh Danny? <br /><br />Jesse & Joey keep getting jobs REALLY QUICKLY with no experience
Wish Jodie Sweetin could have learned from Candace Cameron Bure & had a clean NON drug adult life
It is a realistic depiction of rural ranching life which was a big part of American History
The setting is 1906 Wyoming where life had not changed much since the previous century
The film keeps your interest without the added Hollywood myths
The whole family can see this movie and be intrigued about how life was like in America when it was mostly a rural nation
With this film, you will escape the present and witness the daily life of 100 years ago
In a beautiful, scenic environment you will see the hard physical work that was required to survive, as well as the constant worries and concerns of the elements and the market pressures that will make a difference between success or failure
See this movie and experience life as it was for most of our nation's history
My only question is - why aren't there more films like this one
If you are viewing this show for the first time, you may start wondering if you are in an alternate reality
Colorful and imaginative characters? Entertaining dialogue? Plots that seem to have some depth to them, even creating atmospheres of suspense and drama at times? I mean, this is a syndicated children's show right? This is the same venue that has brought kids such drek as "Pokemon", "Pepper Ann", "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers", and "VR Troopers" (please note that three of the titles mentioned above are crass Japanese exports, courtesy of the Fox Network and Saban Entertainment)
Don't worry, you are just sampling some of the quality fare that was available to kids during the late 1980's and early 1990's
Some examples of this period would be "Transformers", "Garfield and Friends", "Captain Power", and "C
" (a cartoon NOT to be confused with the live action show on Fox)
Besides these prime examples, Disney also returned to syndicated programs for kids, coming up with a lineup called "The Disney Afternoon"
Aside from a dumbed-down show called "The Gummi Bears", early shows like "Darkwing Duck", "Duck Tales", and "Chip 'N Dale's Rescue Rangers" gave credence to the Disney animation teams that were also turning out theatrical classics like "The Little Mermaid", "Beauty and the Beast", "The Rescuers Down Under", and "The Great Mouse Detective"
But above all these wonders shines "TaleSpin"
The premiere of "Plunder and Lightning" was a two-hour thrill ride, and won an Emmy
Much to my delight, the rest of the episodes were up to par on the promise of the premiere
<br /><br />While I enjoy the plots and dialogue, I guess for me the greatest attraction are the characters
There's Rebecca Cunningham, an independent female, but still fallible; Kit Cloudkicker, full of pre-teen angst and optimism; Louie, with his loyalty and support; Frank Wildcat, the most entertaining engineer since Scotty on the original "Star Trek"; Molly Cunningham, cute and witty, but with some depth that most child characters don't have, and of course in the middle of it all, there's Baloo, whom I would describe as a slobby version of James Bond
This is because whenever there's trouble, Baloo saves the day with the assistance of his sleeker-than-most, fastest-of-all Sea Duck (Read: James Bond's Aston Martin)
Of course every great show has to have great villains, and TaleSpin doesn't disappoint here either
From the megalomania of businesstiger Shere Kahn, to the vain and always failing air pirate Don Karnage, to the hilarious and inept Soviet-satirized Thembrians
The animation is good, the music appropriate, and the episodes are (for me) the finest that children's programming has ever had to offer
As did others in this forum, when "Fobidden Planet" was offered in 1956, I rushed to see it
This story is an interesting phenomenon I suggest because young, old, male, female, sci-fi experts and people who find such fare 'way out" all can follow and enjoy this film's story and plot lines very well
This is the first movie set on a planet other than Earth in the 20th Century other than serials such as "Flash Gordon"
Leslie Nielsen was vocally a bit weak for his role, at that time, but Walter Pigeon, Marvin Miller, Anne Francis, Richard Anderson, Earl Holliman and especially Warren Stevens all acquitted themselves very well
There are so many visual splendors in this one, it's hard to choose a favorite from the film's scenes
The approach to Altair-4, the starship itself, the landing on the planet's alien surface, the descent via extensor stairs, the first view of the landscape, the approach of the rocket-sled, Dr
Morbius's house seen from without and from within, the underground complex and its wonders, the setup of the weaponry, the battle with the monster, the final approach of the unseen destroyer,the escape from the doomed planet--all these scenes are etched into the viewer's mind because we discover them along with the participants
Veteran Cyril Hume's literate script was filmed intelligently by long-time director Fred McLeod Wilcox with clarity and imagination
it is a shock to realize there's no music at all; the film is carried by the words, the actors and the mystery-revelation storyline
It can be watched again and again with pleasure--I have been doing so for nearly fifty years
Until this famous and well-loved film was created, no film had tried to imagine a world beyond Earth; and for decades afterward, ships kept crashing back on the planet--as if the writers' imaginations were failing and causing the crashes
That says something negative about this nation's so-called intellectual leaders' imaginations--and something very positive indeed I suggest about those who made this gem
The funky, yet strictly second-tier British glam-rock band Strange Fruit breaks up at the end of the wild'n'wacky excess-ridden 70's
The individual band members go their separate ways and uncomfortably settle into lackluster middle age in the dull and uneventful 90's: morose keyboardist Stephen Rea winds up penniless and down on his luck, vain, neurotic, pretentious lead singer Bill Nighy tries (and fails) to pursue a floundering solo career, paranoid drummer Timothy Spall resides in obscurity on a remote farm so he can avoid paying a hefty back taxes debt, and surly bass player Jimmy Nail installs roofs for a living
Former loving groupie turned patient, understanding, long-suffering manager Juliet Aubrey gets the group back together for an ill-advised, largely ineffectual and hilariously disastrous twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of Europe
Our lovably ragged bunch try gamely, but fumblingly to reignite a flame that once burned quite brightly back in the day
Scraggly zonked-out roadie Billy Connelly and cocky eager beaver young guitarist Hans Matheson tag along for the delightfully bumpy, trouble-plagued, but still ultimately rewarding and enjoyable ride
<br /><br />Director Brian Gibson shows tremendously infectious respect and adoration for both his amiably screwy characters in particular and loud, ringing, flamboyantly overblown preening 70's rock in general, this imbuing this affectionate little pip with an utterly engaging sense of big-hearted charm and tireless verve
The astute, sharply written script by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais likewise bristles with spot-on dry wit and finely observed moments of joyous on the road inanity, capturing a certain bittersweetly affecting and frequently uproarious vibe that gives the picture itself an irresistibly luminescent glow
Ashley Rowe's lovely, elegant cinematography ensures that the movie always looks quite visually sumptuous while the perfectly catchy and groovy music does the trick with right-on rockin' flair and aplomb
Kudos also to the across-the-board terrific performances that vividly nail the burnt-out soul and tattered, but still fiercely beating heart of a past its prime has-been ragtag rock outfit desperate to regain its erstwhile evanescent glory in one final bid for big time success
All in all, this radiant and touching gem rates highly as one of the true seriocomic sleeper treats from the 90's
I work at a movie store, and as such, I am always on the look-out for an excellent movie
I decided to check out Nothing as it sat in our Canadian section, and I've been trying to support my country's movie industry
The film features David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationships
It is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters, as well as some funny exchanges ("We can't be dead, we have cable!")
What more can I say without noting that it is worth a shot, even if you abandon it within the first half an hour
Dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictive film making
The storyline across the 4 parts blends mindless action, slap-stick humor, touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions
It's hard to believe that there was only one director, as the style changes from episode to episode
A must-see movie for anyone who likes anime
enjoyed the movie and efficient Confucian crime drama, the old order survives the threat posed by a brash young greedy man, no doubt representing modern society
I thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big D was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long
I loved the scene and for once in a Chinese movie, the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest
On thing that always amuses me about HK films is that the main influence the British seem to have had is to introduce 'yes sir' and 'sorry' into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone, they are still there
At the time I recall being quite startled and amused by this movie
I referred to it as the most important movie I'd seen in ten years, and found myself bumping into people who said similar things
<br /><br />Bernhard has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook
And she has shaped the bitter adolescent personality that we all had, into a corrosive, adult world-view
The two together provide a startling mix which may be too edgy for some viewers
I wish you weren't my brother so I could **** you!) <br /><br />Bernhards search for herself after returning to LA from New York, results in the immersive trying-on of various personas (all of which fit poorly) for our amusement, but enough of them involve acting out to appeal to a "black imperative" values system that the real barometer of her resituation is whether black culture accepts her
And she has an impressive, solidly-built black lover in the movie) A pretty black girl attends the shows, and seems to be authorizing Sandra's faux-blackness, but ultimately rejects her
<br /><br />Just as Catholics deem themselves lucky to suffer for Christ, here Sandra depicts herself suffering at the hands of a black culture in which she craves a place; as if she cherishes her worthiness and her rejection
It's the only value system implicated in the films world, outside of Bernhards arty confusion
<br /><br />For a nation whose chief issues are racism and money, it's refreshing to see one of the 2 topics dealt with in an atypical way
The true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way (note that this change need not be positive or beneficial) at the end
<br /><br />By that measure, Enchanted April is a resounding success
As a film in general, it succeeds quite well-excellent ensemble cast, well-developed characters you come to care about, wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations
Although all the performances are first-rate, three must be mentioned-Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright
It says something when Miranda Richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast
Most highly recommended, particularly if you are a romantic at heart
Director / writer Michael Winner's feature is a better than expected offbeat supernatural horror film (although still schlock efficiently catered for), which really does by go unnoticed
Sure it might borrow ideas from other similar themed horror movies of this period, but still manages to bring its own psychological imprint to the smokescreen material (of good vs
evil) and a unique vision that has a fair share of impressively expansive, if somewhat exploitative set-pieces
As a whole it's sketchy, however remains intriguing by instilling an ominous charge without going gang-busters with the scares
Actually there's always something going on amongst its busy framework, but it's rather down-played with its shocks steering to soapy patterns and atmospheric tailoring, up until its vividly repellent and grisly climax with a downbeat revelation
Winner's dressed up craftsmanship might feel pedestrian, however it's the ensemble cast that really holds it together as you try to spot the faces
Some having more to do with the scheme of things than others, but there's no doubts every one of them are committed, despite the ludicrously crude nature of it all
It's interesting to see names like Sylvia Miles (who's significantly creepy!), Beverly D'Angelo (likewise), Deborah Raffin, Eli Wallach, Christopher Walken, William Hickey (a neat cameo), Jeff Goldblum, Jerry Orbach and Tom Berenger in bit parts
Then you got a mild-mannered Chris Sarandon and movingly gorgeous Cristina Raines in the leads
Offering able support José Ferrer, Martin Balsam, Ava Gardner, John Carradine, Burgess Meredith and Arthur Kennedy
The script does throw around many characters, as well as notions but gets disjointedly sidetrack by trying to squeeze all of it in
However it's disorienting air works in its favour in establishing the suspicion and deception of what's really going on here
Is there a reason for all of this, and why is it surrounding Raines' character? The emphasis is mainly built upon that moody angle, as it begins to slowly shed light of her inner goings and that of the strange/worrying experiences she encounters when she's moves into her new apartment
This is where Winner tries to pull out the eerie shades, which projects some icy moments
Gil Melle was the man responsible for the grand, overpowering orchestral score that never misses a cue and Richard C
Kratina instruments the sweeping, scope-like photography
William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) buy an old house where a brutal murder happened years ago in very bad condition with the intention of restoring it
They move with their daughter Sophie (Emma RidleY), and become friends of their neighbors Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher)
However, eerie events happen in the house, inclusive the death of Sophie's cat
In Sophie's birthday party, a pipe leaks blood and they leave the place, disclosing a secret later
<br /><br />"The House That Bled to Death" is a scary and one of the best episodes of the series "Hammer House of Horror"
The fantastic twist, disclosing a secret, and the tragic conclusion are really excellent
<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "A Casa Que Sangrou Até Morrer" ("The House That Bled to Death"
Kubrick proved his brilliantness again, now in a suspense-horror film based on Stephen King's book titled the same way
Jack Torrance is a man in his forties, married, with one child, and with a past of trouble and alcoholism
The Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends service during the winter because of its extreme weather, and there is a well-paid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during those five months; and Torrance, who was looking to become a writer, found it perfect
But, the manager advised Torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter, potentially dangerous, and told him that some caretaker in the past went crazy and murdered his family
Even before they got there, his son Danny, who has some sort of imaginary friend who illuminates him the future (shinning), knew the place wasn't good and didn't want to go
Once they installed themselves in the hotel, things started right but within a month, Jack began acting strange, irritated, and depressed
At this point, we know something is going to happen, but don't know when and how
Scary things happen such as the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny, and someone who attacked him violently
Later on, Jack started to see other people and immediately felt good with them, like if they were his family; among them the famous psychotic caretaker, Delbert Grady
Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are "intruders" in the hotel
Obeying this order, Jack went for the objective and many of the most scary things I've ever seen happen here
The ending is spectacular and the viewers will stay interested and shocked until the last minute
Deathtrap runs like a play within a movie about who did what to whom, as it primarily takes place on one set
The premise is that an accomplished playwright, whose star is falling, receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student and so he plans to off his protege and appropriate his play, to the (loud) protests of his wife
Or so you think, for the first half of the movie
Past the halfway mark, Deathtrap begins to throw in twists and surprises that turn its premise on its head, then right around, and then in a mad spin, all the time keeping its title appropriate
It's an excellent mystery movie soaked in wit
<br /><br />Michael Caine, as the senior playwright, plays himself in this movie - a slightly loony and very dramatic Brit
No surprises here - he does his usual good work
He gets the best line of Deathtrap, which he executes perfectly: "What is your definition of success, being gang-banged in a state penitentiary?" <br /><br />Christopher Reeve, on the other hand, juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance playing the ambitious (and psychopathic) young playwright
He also gets to show off his very toned body, which he must've retained coming off the Superman movies
<br /><br />Caine and Reeve have collaborated in another movie that's one of my favorite comedies - Noises Off
It similarly revolves around a play as well, although this time Caine is the director and Reeve is an actor
They are joined by comic veterans Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers)
Together, they demonstrate the calamities that befall the bed-hopping cast and crew of a play
On the surface, the movie looks to be mostly slapstick but upon watching you find that they are many subtle jokes that require more than one viewing to catch
Wish this underrated movie was available on DVD
** WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS! **<br /><br />First of all, I would like to say that I really liked this game
I got it for Christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents
<br /><br />First off, I would like to say that the single player was very good
The first level is probably one of the best in the game, when you are at a party in London, and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the Prime minister's daughter
Of course you have to rescue her, and it is quite a big level, but should probably take you at least five minutes
The best part, and I think also the funniest part, is when you are in the jet-pack, and people are rappelling down Big Ben
Just equip the jet-pack's most trusty rocket launcher and blast the clock faces and the enemies down
Pure fun!<br /><br />The rest of the levels are very good, but pretty short
There are four mini-levels you can unlock, and that is one of the let downs, because only the first two of them are actually fun, and the last two to unlock are just 'kill 25 enemies' objectives, I mean, c'mon! We got loads of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad!<br /><br />The multi player, me and some of my friends agree, is very good and challenging, even if there are no bots
Halo didn't have any bots but that is still some fine multi player games! You can be a load of bad guys, and you go against each other, and you can also set traps, which is the best way of killing people without going into view of their character
5/10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved)
Graphics - 9/10 (there is the odd bad graphic, but that isn't extremely often)
Multiplayer - 10/10 (needs no comment, just great, you get to drive in jet-packs and vehicles)
Sound - 8/10 Replay value - 7/10 (the only levels I go back on are the Loondon level and Istanbul Part 1)
5/10<br /><br />Could have a bit of improvement, but it's still good
If you want a serious laugh pain, watch this movie, and the things Bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster
I don't know why they didn't include them in the original movie
It can't be because of time, since the movie is only 101 minutes long
Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor, who has been overlooked for too long
If you went to this movie to see some huge academy award presentation
but if you wanted to see a funny delightful adaptation of an old classic, you will love it
The story line was great, a few parts added like the history of the Grinch made it even better
But although there were a few ADULT comments and cleavage added, this is supped to be a kids or family show
if you do you really wont enjoy the movie
and as for the comments about Ron Howard, try to direct a major motion picture and see how you do
After a cold sex scene, between Andy and Gina, in South America, we know that Andy is a payroll manager who finds himself in a hard economic situation where he badly needs some extra money We also discover that he has been stealing from his job and using the money to his drug habits He's also attempting to keep up with his wife, who just might be having an affair <br /><br />To solve all their problems, he persuades his brothera likable loserto join him in a plan to steal their own parent's small store Their parents are happily married and proprietors of a jewelry store situated in New York's Westchester County Sixty thousand dollars is all they'll need to get their life out of desperation <br /><br />Three main characters are important in this movie<br /><br />First the two brothers Each of them is a complex individual, threatened with multiple motivations, and sunk into doubts and disappointments The two are desperate characters, financially and emotionally<br /><br />Andy is selfish He feels that he has never had the love of his father He is the corrupting influence, turning his brother into an assailant, and his beautiful woman into an adulteress<br /><br />Hank is a puppet too weak to resist his brother's wishes His ex-wife is one of the reasons he needs money as he owes her hundreds in child support
He longs to regain the confidence he once had with his father <br /><br />The third character is their weary and deplorable father Charles Hanson (Albert Finney), especially in the haunting climactic scenes<br /><br />Telling you more about the details could lessen the impact of the film, and therefore the entertainment
<br /><br />Tomei's performance conveys great depth and emotion even with her look, her touch, her particular move<br /><br />Lumet's direction is firm, fresh and brutal
A bit of Trivia b/c I can't figure out how to submit Trivia: In the backdrop of this performance, one of the images is<br /><br />George Serat's "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" painting (seen best in chapter 18), this painting is the subject of a Sonheim musical Sunday in the Park with George
<br /><br />A bit of Trivia b/c I can't figure out how to submit Trivia: In the backdrop of this performance, one of the images is<br /><br />George Serat's "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" painting (seen best in chapter 18), this painting is the subject of a Sonheim musical Sunday in the Park with George
A humorous, but poignant look at family, and the obligations that come with it
The story of a man who comes home from his life in the city to his fathers bath house in a small Chinese village
There he learns to appreciate, even cherish the very things he left home to get away from
The film is as visually beautiful as it is emotionally beautiful
<br /><br />So, not being a poet myself, I have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary
The effortless motion of Goldsworthy, as he molds natures beauty into his own work is captivating
Watch him stick reeds together in a web hanging from a tree in a close up for a few minutes while he speaks of his work, and then receive the payoff when the camera cuts to the wide shot
Be amazed by the ease with which he operates and then realize the futility when a slight breeze knocks down the entire web
<br /><br />The genius of Goldsworthy seemingly knows no bounds as his inspiration is nature itself
It is in the essential change of nature where his work, though complete in its own sphere, is made whole
Kurosawa, fresh into color, losses sight of his usual themes of truth and perception of reality and opts for a depressing take on Tokyo's slums
Kurosawa stretches for a style that was, in my opinion, his antithesis- that is to say, I feel as if Kurosawa wanted to make an Ozu picture
Poorly paced, poorly conceived, this movie is a rare dud in this auteur body of excellent work
While Ikiru, while being mundane and depressing, was still interesting and well paced, and while Stray Dog depicted the slums and social poverty of Japan without being too heavy handed or boring, do desu ka den has all the somberness that one could expect with its content, with none of the redeeming qualities of earlier Kurosawa pictures
<br /><br />Be warned, this is not a movie that Kurosawa should be judged by
Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a film made up of 18 segments
You can do the math--18 segments in 120 minutes means each director had seven minutes to tell her or his story
The movie is based on the premise that you can, indeed, tell a story in that short amount of time
Almost all of the segments are powerful, complete, and satisfying
Each presents a different aspect of the Parisian experience, and almost every director draws forth outstanding performances from a cast of great and near-great actors
<br /><br />There were so many powerful portrayals in this film that it's hard to pick one or two favorites
Probably the most memorable to me were Juliette Binoche as a grieving mother in the segment "Place des Victoires," Gena Rowlands as an aging beauty in "Quartier Latin," Catalina Sandino Moreno as a maid in the segment "Loin du 16ème" and Margo Martindale as a Colorado mail carrier who has learned to speak French so she can visit Paris ("14ème Arrondissement" segment)
<br /><br />Special mention must be given to Gulliver Hecq, probably the meanest little boy to ever harass an American tourist in a Parisian Metro Station (segment "Tuileries")
My wife and I decided to rent it in a few months so we can catch some of the subtle points we surely missed
However, Paris is photographed so beautifully that I would suggest that you try to see it on a large screen
This movie was very good because it remember when I was young when I maked snow castle
This is a good quebeker movie with no much money and is also a magical movie because their wonderfull castle is very big and beautiful
It's plain as day that this fill is genius
The universe sent Trent Harris a young, wonderfully strange man one day and Harris caught him on tape, in all that true misfit glory that you just can't fake
Too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man, if only an alternate ending could be written for that fellow's story
The other two steps in the trilogy do retell the story, with Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the roles of the young men, respectively
The world is expanded upon and the strangeness is contextualized by the retelling, giving us a broader glimpse into growing up weird in vanilla America
Peaceful rancher Robert Sterling is on the losing side of a range war with his ruthless neighbors, that is until notorious outlaw Robert Preston shows up out of the blue to level the playing field
Soon he begins to go too far, feeding a growing sense of unease in Sterling, especially when his son begins to idolize the wily criminal
<br /><br />The Sundowners is a tightly-paced, gritty, and surprisingly tough little picture with a great performance by Preston
Here, he comes across as an evil version of Shane, that is until the real nature of the rancher and the outlaw's relationship is revealed
Most movie guides and video boxes spoil the surprise!<br /><br />Rounding out the cast is Chill Wills, Jack Elam, and the debut of John Drew Barrymore, who became more famous for his offspring than his acting
I was forced to see this because a) I have an 11 year-old girl and b) we had shown her the Bonita Granville Nacy Drew movies from the 1930s, which she thoroughly enjoyed
Personally, I didn't think it was as humorous as the 1930s flicks, but on the other hand, it wasn't the nauseating piece of intelligence-insulting fluff I feared it would be
It was an inoffensive, mildly entertaining movie
Although I'm pleased that they didn't try to "upgrade" Nancy to 21st Century "hipness" (Veronica Mars holds the title as the Modern Nancy Drew), I do think that they made her a little too bland, that they didn't do enough to develop Nancy Drew - the movie could have been titled "Jane Doe, Girl Detective"
I have to blame the script: I think each actor did a good job with what they had to work with
I liked Emma Roberts in this role, but they gave her a made-for-TV, not theatrical release, script
I will admit, I thought this movie wasn't going to be any good but I soon changed my mind
The movie was keep you guessing as which direction it's going
Pierce Broson is amazing in his role as a hit man, who suddenly becomes burned out & asks a man he met at a Mexican bar for help
Greg Kinnear is an awesome straight man, as his role as a mild mannered man from Denver, who starts a innocent conversation with Pierce at a Mexican bar
The movie will have you laughing as Pierce delivers hilarious one liners (mostly about sex)
<br /><br />The imaginary in this movie is very well done, especially at the bullfight scene & when Pierce sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs
Considering the big name cast and lavish production I expected a lot more of this film
The acting for the most part is great, although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best
However the film still warrants watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent
Incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over NYC on that fateful morning of September 11th
Intense, personal, and completely riveting, 9/11 is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident, which kind of gives it an even greater appeal
Up until that morning, filmmakers Gideon and Jules Naudet had been following around a New York firefighter team, concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman
Out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup, Jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center, and from there a simple documentary was no more
<br /><br />Viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero, as the amazing group of fire-fighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster
Without hesitation, Naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while it's entire support crumbles around them
The raw fear of an unknown, impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside
Nearly as memorable is older brother Gideon's candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed
By the time we get to see the second tower collapse, as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris, we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up-close footage captured
<br /><br />Obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event, though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event; in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document- only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage, even if it cost them their own safety
<br /><br />After viewing 9/11, and seeing that it came out in 2002, I feel much more resentment towards Oliver Stone's recent rendition, the big budgeted World Trade Center
Many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble, and although I enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental Hollywood focus it brought, 9/11 all but renders his film completely obsolete
Not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day, but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again
Any Way the Wind Blows is Tom Barmans (who is also know as front man of the rock formation 'dEUS') debut movie
Entirely shot in Antwerp (Belgium), the movie starts on a sunny friday morning and skips rather superficially between the events that fill the day of a dozen of main characters
When the movie ends, you have a lot of stuff to think about, because most of the different story-lines are left wide open
<br /><br />The movie has a (purely instrumental) sound track that will rock your socks off
In most scenes, the music truly enhances the general atmosphere and feel, really making the movie hallucinating to watch at certain points of time
The main scene in the film, the party, is very well shot
<br /><br />The director didn't hesitate to use video clip techniques, having his main characters dancing on one of the best sound tracks I've heard lately
<br /><br />The screenplay is great stuff
Camera angles and colors are very well chosen
The 'costumes' are very hot and very 'seventies' too
<br /><br />The thing I liked most about the movie, are the subtle touches of absurd, surreal, very dry or even cynical humor that interleave
<br /><br />Without claiming to be a comedy (this movie certainly is not a comedy but rather an alternative piece of art), it still manages to have its audience giggling and even burst into laughter at some times
<br /><br />This is one more directors' debut that shouldn't be an ending
I hope to see more Tom Barman movies in the future because I had a good time
I loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end
I found the director/ actor's style of directly addressing me/the audience very engaging
<br /><br />What I found most exciting and refreshing about this movie was its ignoring -- and thus challenging -- of gender and class stereotypes
The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths, and the absence of judgment -- and the characters' acceptance of themselves and each other -- enabled me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world
Without preaching, and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this movie has the power to open us to new possibilities, and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals
I look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director
(No need to recap the plot, since others have done so already
)<br /><br />It's understandable that many viewers find fault with the film, raised as we are with the slam-bang sensurround of today's cineplex experience
Against that background, a movie like Ecstasy appears to have wandered in from another planet
I think there are several worthwhile reasons why
<br /><br />Most importantly, the film unfolds poetically, as the camera pans slowly over surrounding hills, trees, clouds, etc
, providing a serene and lyrical sense of a natural world that integrates the man and woman into its fold
Together these reveal a style and dimension almost totally missing from today's technology-driven cinema, where rapid-fire editing works to divert audience attention and not to concentrate it
Additionally, the story is conveyed by eye and not by ear, with almost no dialogue to explain what's happening
This amounts to another extreme departure from today's very literal fare, where visuals only seem to count when they excite the audience
But perhaps most unsettling-- the movie is sometimes eerily quiet, not in the sense that silent films are quiet since we expect them to be
But in the sense that the characters seldom speak when we expect them to
Thus, the burden of the story is shared between the film-maker and the viewer
The former must choose his visuals artfully so as to convey the narrative, while the latter must think about those visuals, since they're not going to be explained
<br /><br />None of this is intended to belittle today's film-making
It's simply to point out that a movie like Machaty's comes out of a very different aesthetic from the one we have today
I don't claim either to be any better or worse
However, I do claim that Ecstasy represents a perspective sorely missing from today's movie-going experience, where such 'contemplative values are routinely dismissed as slow and boring
<br /><br />The film itself is no masterpiece, though at times it reaches artistic heights, as in the beautifully composed beer-garden scene with its final crane shot rising to reveal the exquisite tableau below
The slow pans of the countryside with its pantheistic celebration of life, nature, and regeneration are also wonderfully expressed
These are the kind of scenes that don't overwhelm you, but instead-- given half-a chance-- accumulate quietly into an experience as memorable in its own way as the spine-tingling variety of a "Jaws"
<br /><br />On the other hand, the film is sometimes heavy-handed, as when Machaty piles on the imagery, particularly in the final, ode-to-labor sequence
It's hard to know what to make of this rather disruptive presence
Perhaps the symbolism has to do with the heroic dimension that hard work holds for the love-lorn hero and people in general-- a theme then being promoted by the influential Soviet cinema
Still, its presence here is rather tediously over-done
<br /><br />Anyhow, I've got to admit that I tuned in initially to see the gorgeous Hedy LaMarr in the buff
But now I have to admit that in the process I also got a lot more than just a peek-a-boo romp in the woods
Madhur Bhandarkar goes all out to touch upon taboo issues and gives the most realistic picture of the modern society
One gets the impression of the director even from his earlier movies like Satta and Chandni bar
The issues just hinted on in the latter movie are explored and exposed in totality here
The casting is amazing and one can see the judgements on each scene from many angles
Mostly, the movie leaves you wondering on lots of facts around
As you start guessing the things, you end up at most being close, but missing the mark in many a scenes
It leaves a lasting impression in the end
<br /><br />Actors to watch are Konkana Sen Sharma, Boman Irani & Atul Kulkarni among others
The dialogues are well written and you feel you've lived around some of these people
There are still some scenes that make you think of more depths
The songs are in the background saving time and Lata's voice in a very meaningful song "Kitne Ajeeb" leaves you feeling you're left all alone in the midst of the modern society
Sandra Bernhard's Without You I'm Nothing, the movie released in 1990, followed on the heels of her 1988 off-Broadway stage production
what she and others refer to in the movie as her "smash-hit one-woman show
"<br /><br />There were several changes in monologues and one-liners, and the movie version visually re-vamps the story, taking Sandra from a fabulous existence as a successful stage performer in New York, during what she calls her "superstar summer," to an illusory, almost desperate existence back in her home in Los Angeles - her fictional manager in the film refers to it as getting Sandra back "to her roots, to
upscale supper clubs like the Parisian Room
"<br /><br />There's a point to be made here
Sandra tries to appeal her liberal worldview and her sometimes harsh critique of American pop culture to an audience that doesn't completely see it
she's playing to a predominantly black audience, trying to relate her ideas when all these people seem to want is "Shashonna," a Madonna-look-alike stripper
And even then, with Shashonna dancing to drum beats that resemble those from "Like a Virgin," there's not much to be said for the audience's enjoyment of the show
The scene in the club throughout the movie is dryer than a bone
A funny scene to catch is of a rotund man from the audience helping Shashonna out of her pants
<br /><br />But, if she's going down, Sandra's doing so with style and force, conveying everything from foul confidence to punctured vulnerability
right to the point at which she's naked (literally), pleading for acceptance and yet somehow still swimming in the pool of her own transparent stardom
Her depictions of interactions with the likes of Calvin Klein, Jerry Lewis, Bianca Jagger, Ralph Lauren and (what we're lead to believe is) Warren Beatty are fictional and hilarious
<br /><br />Sandra begins her show in her most awkward moment, performing a quiet but mystifying rendition of Nina Simone's song "Four Women" while dressed in a mufti and other African garb, singing lines such as "my skin is black," "my hair is wooly," and "they call me Sweet Thing
"<br /><br />She resurrects and celebrates the ghosts of underworld art in a tremendously funny description of the frenzied estate auction for Andy Warhol: "Leave it to Andy to have the wisdom and sensitivity into the hours and hours of toil and labor that went into the Indian product
that they've been so lucky to cash in on this whole Santa Fe thing happening
"<br /><br />She expounds on the excessiveness of Hollywood, consoling a distraught friend then admonishing him, saying "Mister, if this is about Ishtar, I'm getting up right now and walking out of your life forever because that's too self-indulgent even for me!"<br /><br />Sandra illustrates the expectations of women in the age of feminism
Dressed as a Cosmo girl, Sandra retells her young-girl fantasy to become an executive secretary and marry her boss
She eventually concludes in relief, "I'll never be a statistic, not me
I'm under 35, and I'm going to be married!"<br /><br />Sandra extols the opening of sexuality in society: "When he touches you in the night, does it feel all right, or does it feel real? I say it feels real
"<br /><br />Finally, she cries for change in progressive American society by channeling disco greats Patrick Cowley and Sylvester and proclaiming, "Eventually everyone will funk!"<br /><br />All this comes in the form of glitzy, schmaltzy but wonderful cabaret performances of songs written and originated by Billy Paul, Burt Bacharach, Hank Williams and Laura Nyro, to name a few
At the same time, the idealized, fictional incarnation of Sandra -- her self-generated mirror image -- floats around town, a beautiful black model with flowing gowns and tight bustiers reading the Kabala, studying chemistry and listening to NWA rap music
<br /><br />In Without You I'm Nothing, Sandra Bernhard explores emotions and existences that, up until then, she'd only toyed with as a regular guest on Late Night With David Letterman
Her almost child-like enthusiasm for shock, exhibited throughout the '80s, is thrown aside in the face of a subtler allure, and her confidence in the face of materialism and American celebrity proves refreshing
This approach to comedy would change Sandra's direction forever and mark the more mature, more personable entertainer to come
<br /><br />If you like subtle humor to the point of engaging in inside jokes about glamour, celebrity, sex, loneliness, despair and shallow expressions of love and kinship, this movie will keep you in stitches
It may not be meant to be funny across the board
Perhaps it's a bit unsettling or even maudlin for some
But consider the emptiness of the world Sandra paints for you, and you'll understand just how funny and brilliant she really is
<br /><br />But see Without You I'm Nothing with a friend "in the know" because it's definitely funnier that way
Before you know it, the two of you will be trading Sandra barbs and confusing the hell out of everyone else
It was intricate and well written and all the characters where likable with out being horribly sweet
Even Jonathan Cake the philandering boyfriend was likable
Since our airwaves are filled with crap like American Idol and Dancing with the Stars, it was nice to see a drama that was not too soap opera like
It was always intriguing to see how each character would be connected to the next circumstance
It really is annoying that we finally get a show that makes you think a little bit and have it thrown out because of some mysterious number that most of us don't even pay attention to
This show will be missed maybe not by a lot of people but by some pretty loyal fans
This story is about a troubled young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington)
A brilliant debut performance by Derek Luke and an always stunning performance by Denzel Washington
<br /><br />This movie was incredible on so many levels and I was disappointed that it didn't win an Oscar, I think it was because it was released at a bad time that's why it was overlooked
I strongly recommend this film to everyone, you'll be touched by his story and it really does make the audience become empathetic with this young man that is Antwone Fisher
<br /><br />If you like inspirational true stories, then watch Antwone Fisher
The original Vampires (1998) is one of my favorites
I was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they used none of the original characters
I was quite surprised at how this played out
As a rule, sequels are never as good as the original, with a few exceptions
Though this one was not a great movie, the writer did well in keeping the main themes & vampire lore from the first one in tact
Jon Bon Jovi was a drawback initially, but he proved to be a half-way decent Slayer
I doubt anyone could top James Wood's performance in the first one, though
unless you bring in Buffy!<br /><br />All in all, this was a decent watch & I would watch it again
<br /><br />I was left with two questions, though
what happened to Jack Crow & how did Derek Bliss come to be a slayer? Guess we'll just have to leave that to imagination
Kenneth Branagh's "Hamlet" hits all the marks
The acting is magnificent, the 70mm cinematography is gorgeous, the Oscar-nominated costumes and sets are stunning, and Patrick Doyle's score (also Oscar-nominated) is sensitive and moving
Oh yeah - the screenplay, by some guy named Will S
Film critics ribbed Branagh for receiving the films' fourth Oscar nod for "adapting" the screenplay, but his decision to use the full text was a gutsy one
I can't think of many better ways to make four hours fly by
<br /><br />Nearly every decision Branagh makes works brilliantly: the use of England's Blenheim Palace for exteriors, the Edwardian dress, and the staging of "To be or not to be" in a hall of mirrors, to name a few
The casting of Hollywood luminaries such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in minor parts can be distracting, but that's nitpicking
The principal cast excels: Derek Jacobi captures the conflicted nature of Claudius; Kate Winslet acutely depicts Ophelia's descent into madness; Julie Christie brings passion to her portrayal of Gertrude; Richard Briers is pitch-perfect as the conniving Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell elevates the potentially thankless role of Horatio to the apotheosis of true friendship
Every speech, every line, every word is delivered with passion and conviction; there isn't a wasted moment in the entire film
The final scenes magnify the extent of Shakespeare's tragedy in a way not possible with theatrical adaptations
<br /><br />Branagh's "Hamlet" is a bold, ambitious, and ultimately successful attempt to match the grandeur and poetry of Shakespeare's language with equally eloquent imagery
It's arguably the greatest Shakespearean adaptation ever filmed  strong praise, but well deserved
I love this anime! I was laughing my head off with all of the jokes and the violence (mostly from Akane Ranma's reluctant but short tempered "fiancee")is so slapstick however Ranma does deserve it but he does try his best to make amends
The main character Ranma goes to China to train only to fall into the cursed Jusenkkyo Spring and turns into a girl when splashed by cold water
From then on it's pure chaos one after another
Among the stand outs are the deranged brother and sister duo of Kuno and Kodachi, the sexy Shampoo, the pervert Happosai all causing trouble for our hero/heroine
However it is Ranma's selfish father Genma who winds up being the culprit for the mess most of the time
If anyone want an anime that's funny, this is the one
It's cuter and better with the Japanese dub
A well-made and imaginative production, refreshingly free from cliché, this somewhat picaresque affair recounts a tale of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy under less than ideal conditions: the man an escaped convict who has kidnapped the youth for his value as a hostage
Expertly directed by Alan Gibson with a fine sense for balanced narrative movement, the film provides freshness in nearly every scene, as felon Martin Steckert (Richard Harris), believing that his rejection for parole was particularly undeserved, contrives a convoluted but ultimately successful escape plan, following which his spontaneous nature comes to the fore as he flees to the lakeside residence of his childhood
Often bursting into song or dancing a few steps, the capricious Steckert gradually gains the trust and affection of his captive and, as police close in for an inevitable showdown, the tethered pair are seen to be a great deal alike in their responses to forms of rejection, as discerned by a psychiatrist (Lindsay Wagner) assigned to aid a zealous police lieutenant (James Coburn) who is in charge of the manhunt for Steckert and his "prisoner"
This is an engrossing story, worth telling, a quickly-paced and novel adventure that profits from a capital performance by Harris, fine turns from Wagner, Coburn, and Karen Black, along with Justin Henry as the snatched lad, with an appropriately whimsical score contributed by Wilfred Josephs, and top-notch cinematography by Frank Watts, with all footage shot in a beautiful autumnal Ontario province
A lot of people hated this movie, but that I blame on two facts - 1 - They want it to be too much like the first couple of American Pie movies
and 2 - they are trying to take it too seriously
<br /><br />This one I found was the best one out of all six, and I absolutely love Dwight
The plot is predictable, I'll say that, but then what teen comedy ISN'T? Road Trip, Dirty Deeds etc etc, they are all incredibly predictable, but still goddamn funny! I say this is worth watching, I love it, I find it hilarious
Just don't watch it while comparing it to the first ones because it's nothing alike
<br /><br />After watching Naked Mile and this one, it became obvious that all the American Pie movies were about, and only about, the Stiflers
Ernest Borgnine was so wasted in this movie
There was no point in putting this great actor in this movie
One of the greatest actors in the world wasted,and for what reason, none what so ever,so america if you want to put classic actors in movies DON'T WASTE THE
Steve Carrel Proves himself to be a great leading man in this wonderful, original, raunchy breath of fresh air
I about wet myself at how geniusly hilarious it was
<br /><br />Basically the movie's title says it all: Andy Stitzer is a 40 Year- Old Male who works at an electronics store
He is a bit of a nerd who loves videogames and Comics, and has the biggest collection
His Peers that work in the store with him find out that he's a Virgin during a rather sex dialogue filled poker game, and then Andy has to go through a rather funny as hell Odyessy of rude sexual awakenings, but always screwing up which leads to him not losing his virginity, but he eventually gets lucky in the very end
<br /><br />Leave the little ones at home, But Take the entire family to see This awesome Romantic Adult Comedy
It will have you hooked and cracking up from the very beginning, and by the time it is over, you will be wishing you wore your extra thick absorbent undergarments
Only other thing I can say about it is Too bad Steve Carrel wasn't recognized as a leaving man 20 years ago
He is definitely gonna win best breakthrough male performance in next years MTV movie Awards
You can bet your hard earned dollar on that, people!<br /><br />I Give this one a perfect 10
David Duchovney creates a role that he was to replicate somewhat in Californication - the troubled talent
<br /><br />This thriller starts off at a good speed and carries you through to the end
Timothy Hutton plays a fine villain and Angelina Jolie pouts
The story of a disgraced doctor finding his way into a criminal world is well scripted
Drug addiction and a desire for the sultry Jolie mix a heady cocktail
Unfortunately towards the end the story gets a little weaker and the relationships between villains and the FBI is muddled and rushed as if it was created only to develop the final scene
This movie started me on a Nick Cage kick
It is a story full of twists and turns- a movie of motives and moves
Of, course, Dennis Hopper was a ham, but J
Walsh and Laura Flyyn Boyle are the perfect pair to catch the unsuspecting man who has fallen into their web
Everything about this movie is good - cinematography, story pace and most of all the end
Cage excels at what he does best- it's not to be an action hero but to be an everyman caught in the snares of life
The fourth of five westerns Anthony Mann did with James Stewart, this one involves a hard bitten cattleman named Jeff Webster who takes a cattle drive from Wyoming to Alaska, via Seattle
He hooks up in Seattle with his partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C
Flippen) that he has sent ahead of time in order to make preparations for the boat trip, north
<br /><br />But first, he has to put up with insubordinate trail hands, cheating riverboat captains and the charms of coy, manipulative Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) who believes Jeff could be a valuable ally in the future
That's why she hides him out on the boat while the captain's looking for him for the earlier (and justifiable) killing of a trail hand
<br /><br />Jeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy Judge Gannon (John McIntire) who runs the town of Skagway, Alaska
Gannon locks Jeff up for disrupting his public hanging by running his cattle through town
He fines Jeff the ownership of his cattle and Jeff just has to eat crow for the time being
<br /><br />In the meantime, Jeff agrees to ride point for Ronda up to Dawson in order to deliver supplies
But this is just a ruse so Jeff, Ben and Rube can slip back into Skagway and steal his cattle back
Of course Judge Gannon finds out about this and is right behind but is delayed by Jeff with a rifle while Ben races the cattle over the Canadian border out of Gannon's reach
<br /><br />After avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other Skagway men, they finally reach Dawson where Jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder, which just happens to be Ronda who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in Dawson
Jeff then takes his money and buys himself a claim and starts panning for gold
<br /><br />But then Judge Gannon comes up to Dawson to get in on the gold action up there, and tells Jeff that he was getting a little bored with Skagway and wants to try his luck up in the Klondike, himself
That involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner's claims
Jeff and Ben now feel it's time to clear out while the goings are good, leaving Rube to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against Gannon and his gang
<br /><br />They look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by Gannon's men because Ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth
Ben is killed and Jeff is severely wounded but that doesn't save Judge Gannon from his just due
The ending shootout at night on the muddy Dawson street pretty much takes care of that
First Jeff kills two of Gannon's best gunman (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie)
Then as Ronda comes out to warn Jeff that Gannon is trying to slip around behind him, Gannon shoots her in the back and she dies right there in Jeff's arms
Then Jeff kills Gannon as he's hiding under a wooden sidewalk
<br /><br />This is another rip-roaring western that's right up there with THE NAKED SPUR and THE MAN FROM LARAMIE
Why the Universal DVD uses a pan-and-scan print instead of the widescreen print TCM uses, is beyond me
You'll wind up missing half the glorious Alberta cinematography by William Daniels
So if you like well-written 50s westerns, then this one's an A-list keeper
"The Ladies Man" suffers a common problem among movies based on "Saturday Night Live" skits
And that is, a sketch that usually succeeds in five minutes will not do so well in ninety minutes
Although this movie does have its laughs, like Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps, a sex-maniac straight out of the '70s, and Will Ferrell as a wrestling-obsessed husband cuckolded by Leon
So this movie is funny enough, but it's no "Wayne's World"
*SPOILERS* Four men, Ed (Jon Voight), Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Drew (Ronny Cox) and Bobby (Ned Beatty), decide to go on a rafting trip on the Cahulawassee river, before it is flooded
<br /><br />They wanted to have fun, to have a nice weekend in the nature
<br /><br />But when two mountain men cross their path and rape one of them (Bobby), everything begins to go to Hell in a Handbasket, and this 'nice weekend' will even cost one of the four's life
<br /><br />'Deliverance', which in Italian is stupidly titled 'Un Tranquillo Weekend Di Paura' ('A Calm Weekend Of Fear'), is the Grandad of movies like 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'The Hills Have Eyes', 'Wrong Turn', 'Last House On The Left' and all the other 'Evil Nature/Revenge' subgenre films, and one of the scariest, right next to 'The Hills Have Eyes'
<br /><br />Based on a book by James Dickey (who appears in the movie as Sheriff Bullard), it's a chilling story on how someone can go into a situation thinking he knows everything, when he doesn't
<br /><br />And the image of the dead man's hand raising from under the water, or the hands holding the rifle from the one-sheet are haunting images that will never leave your mind
Oh my, from the box description I thought it would be LA-crazy like 2 Days in the Valley or Hugo Pool
Most, after directing this, would have driven off a cliff or at least committed a mass murder
I confess to only watching the first half hour (for now)
Reading all the comments here, I have a lot to look forward to
Professional reviews often mention the Swedish film Songs from the Second Floor as a parallel but that's graced with humor and fantasy and this is unrelenting in its dour realism
What hath the Marshall Plan and the EU wrought? Seeing this in a theater with anyone I know would have only resulted in an enforced departure after many fewer minutes than I got through on DVD
There's a more annoying creature in the universe than Jar Jar Binks - the Hitchhiker from Hell
Whatever happens to her, it isn't enough! Soulless suburbia that I thought only existed in Arizona and Florida thrives in Lower Austria
Oh no! I thought sex clubs had ceased to exist even in New York and San Francisco, and here they are in suburban shopping malls? Was it Mahatma Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru who said when asked about Western Civilization, 'why that might be a nice idea'? If the world were truly like this film, bring on that black hole, we're ready
A French novelist, disgusted by his wife's society friends, goes to North Africa for a respite
There he encounters a vivacious & talented Bedouin girl, living in poverty
To spite his wife, who is romancing a Maharajah, he decides to train & educate the girl, and present her to Parisian society as the PRINCESSE TAM TAM
<br /><br />The marvelous Josephine Baker is perfectly cast in the title role in this very enjoyable French film
With her enormous eyes & infectious smile, she makes contact with the viewer's heartstrings immediately
Her over-sized personality & obvious joy of performing make her a pure pleasure to watch
Baker makes us care about what's happening to poor Alwina during her transformation & introduction to European mores
<br /><br />Albert Préjean does very well as the Pygmalion to Baker's Galatea; also effective are Georges Peclet as a half-caste servant, and Jean Galland as the mysterious Maharajah
<br /><br />The film is very handsome & well made, looking a little reminiscent of Busby Berkeley movies being produced at the same time in America - although unlike American films of this period, PRINCESSE TAM TAM hasn't any racism
It should be pointed out that there was no Hays Office or Production Code in France
Some of the dialogue & action is rather provocative, but it must be admitted that Baker singing & dancing to 'Under The African Sky,' as well as her culminating performance in the Parisian nightclub, are two of the cinema's more memorable moments
<br /><br />Actual location filming in Tunisia greatly enhances the film
<br /><br />Josephine Baker was born in St
Her talent & driving ambition, however, soon pushed her into moving East and she was briefly a cast member of the Ziegfeld Follies
Realizing that America in the mid-1920's held great limitations for a gifted Black woman, she managed to get herself to Paris, where she eventually joined the Foliés-Bergeres & Le Negre Revue
The French adored her and she became a huge celebrity
A short return to America in 1935 showed Baker that things had not changed for African-Americans
She returned to France, became a French citizen & worked for the Resistance during the early days of the War
Baker relocated to Morocco for the duration and entertained Allied troops stationed there
<br /><br />After the War, Baker's fortunes began to slide and she faced many financial & personal difficulties
For a while, she was even banned from returning to the United States
Finally, Baker accepted an offer from Princess Grace of Monaco to reside in the Principality
Josephine Baker was on the verge of a comeback when she died of a stroke in 1975, at the age of 68
<br /><br />Having appeared in only two decent films - ZOUZOU & PRINCESSE TAM TAM - Baker is in danger of becoming obscure
But she deserves her place alongside Chevalier, Dietrich & Robeson, as one of her generation's truly legendary performers
When I first read Armistead Maupins story I was taken in by the human drama displayed by Gabriel No one and those he cares about and loves
That being said, we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of Hollywood
<br /><br />Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have truly succeeded! <br /><br />With just the right amount of restraint Robin Williams captures the fragile essence of Gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life(Jess) and the world around him(Donna)
<br /><br />As we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably
The request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps Gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward
<br /><br />It's to bad that most people will avoid this film
I only say that because the average American will probably think "Robin Williams in a serious role? That didn't work before!" PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE! Robin Williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people
Like his movie One Hour Photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art
<br /><br />Oh and before I forget, I believe Bobby Cannavale as Jess steals every scene he is in
He has the 1940's leading man looks and screen presence
It's this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now!!<br /><br />S
"Pet Sematary" is an adaptation from the Stephen King novel of the same title
The story follows the Creeds - an all American, middle-class family, who move into a house out in the country
The family consists of Louis and Rachel, and their two young children, Ellie and their toddler son, Gage
The house couldn't be better, and the family meets a strange but friendly old man, Jud, who lives across the road
He leads them down an old path into the woods one day where a pet graveyard lies - filled with a huge amount of animal graves
And just beyond there, lies a sacred Indian burial ground that seems to possess a strange power
When the family cat, Church, is killed, Louis sees it fit to bury him in the pet cemetery - and strangely enough, soon after, Church returns to life
But there's something evil about him now, he isn't the same cat he used to be
And when a tragic accident takes the life of young Gage, Louis decides to apply the same concept in hopes of reviving his dead son
unfortunately, he gets more than he bargained for
<br /><br />Having read Stephen King's novel, I can say that the book is much better than the film
Not to say the movie is bad, because it isn't - the book is just a little bit better
The real strength in this film lies in it's story, which is both bizarre but extremely original, something that King's stories are typically known for
The script is very well adapted from the story, and while it minorly differs in some aspects, it's a pretty good page-to-screen transformation
There are a few plot holes here and there, nothing major though
Besides that, this movie is actually pretty scary, and it succeeds in it's intention to do so
There are some really disturbing scenes throughout the film, and I'd have to say that the flashback sequence of Rachel's sister Zelda is the number one
Honestly, that is one of the most disgusting, disturbing things I've ever seen in a horror film - it's not gory and bloody, it's just flat out sickening
One thing's for sure, that image won't leave your head anytime soon
<br /><br />The performances in this film were all very up to par and I really had no problem there
This film is actually on the gory side, there are plenty of nasty little sequences to please all of the gore hounds out there, including the shocker of an ending
I really liked the way they ended the film, it was abrupt and somewhat inconclusive, but it worked better that way with all things considered
<br /><br />Overall, "Pet Sematary" is a good horror movie that I'd recommend to those who are fans of either Stephen King or just fans of the genre in general
The story is the film's greatest asset and it's a creepy one too
One of the better Stephen King adaptations I'd say
It's highly imaginative, creative and clever
It's just plain fun and in my opinion this film tops the first one
But the film was forgotten when it first came out, and became even more overlooked as the years passed
"Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey" also bombed at the box office, whereas the first one was a pretty good hit and very popular
<br /><br />I think the problem may be that this film was just released a couple years too late
In 1991, Bill and Ted already seemed "so '80s"
Even though the '80s were only a couple years ago back at that time, the landscape of the music and style for kids had changed so radically with gangsta rap, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and the Seattle sound
Bill and Ted with their Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N' Roses music along with their '80s style seemed so out of place and very outdated in '91, and I think that's one BIG reason the film bombed at the box office
Nobody but surfers were still saying stuff like "excellent!" and "bogus!" in 1991
"Gremlins 2" which also came out in the early '90s suffered a similar fate of being a good film that bombed at the box office because it was too associated with the '80s
The transition from the '80s to the '90s was a much faster change then now with the '90s and '00s
1991 was nothing like 1988 or 1989, whereas right now, 2002 and last year 2001 still looks/looked like 1995 or 1996
<br /><br />If only "Excellent Adventure" which was made in 1988, was released THAT YEAR instead of 1989, and "Bogus Journey" was made quickly and released in 1989, then it too would have probably been just as wildly received as the first
I can admit that the screenplay isn't very good, and that it has some slow parts, but all of you critics of this movie need to learn how to have some fun
First of all, the performances are great (Michael Douglas, Kim Basinger, Kiefer Sutherland, and Eva Longoria
Michael Douglas proves he has still got it, and Kim Basinger plays a very interesting character as the cheating wife
Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria, play the dynamic duo, both adding their incredible talent to the pot
And second of all, this movie is the most fun I have had in years in a Theodore
Its plain and simple, if you want to go to the movies, and have a lot of fun see, The Sentinel
This is without a doubt the greatest film ever made
It is nearly incomprehensible even with many repeated viewings in an attempt to figure out what exactly's going on
The film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers, commercials, contests one enters by mail, and a host of other innovations
Besides, what other movies have cameos by Martin Luther King, Jr? To decipher the film, hunt down the director's book entitled I Was Curious
It's a grand and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking
Now if only someone would put out a version with the subtitles in a color *other* than white
the white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible
I was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced: It should have been cruder, to match we saw in the original series
The cast is interesting, although the Vulkan lady comes across as a little too human
She needs to school on Spock who, after all, is the model for this race
Too bad they couldn't have picked Jeri Ryan
Haven't sorted out the other males, except for the black guy
Bakula needs to find his niche--In QL his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything
He is, of course, big and strong enough for the heroics
The heavies were OK, although I didn't like their make-up
"The Incredible Melting Man" is a fantastically gross, trashy and energetic Z-grade production that every self-respecting camp-horror freak simply has to see for him/herself! The ideal way to describe this low-budget 70's gem is like a shameless copy of Hammer's "The Quatermass Xperiment"
only a thousand times filthier! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space-mission, but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and
causes him to melt! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve busts out of the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind
Doctor Ted Nelson has to find him urgently, as the disease also set Steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh
The premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make-up effects from the hand of Rick Baker
The melting dude's face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader! Another big advantage is that William Sachs' screenplay doesn't waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches
The repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film
Just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because, if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script, you'll miss out on all the campy fun
This is a great movie for all Generation X'ers
What a different world the America of 1972 was compared to our psychotic 21st Century
You can get a sense of what an 1972 America gone by was like by watching this movie
I found that the clothing and the car styles brought back to me fond memories of a much better country than we have now
back then there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from
There was no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, Road Rage, 911, Bird Flu, Freeway Snipers, etc, etc
There will still be 7 years before Star Wars comes out
The personal computer and internet would still be 29 years away
<br /><br />When this movie first came out the producers had to market the film themselves as no other film company wanted it
So it began touring small Protestant churches around the country being shown on movie projectors(This was the days before VCRS of course)
The pastor of a church who would would be interested in showing A Thief in the NIght to his congregation would obtain a copy of the film
Then he would set up a evening to show it in the church meeting area or lunch room
Members of the congregation would invite "unsaved" friends and family members and it would be a social event of the week
<br /><br />If you can get past the limited production values of the film and just watch it for its nostalgic value, then I think you will enjoy the film more
<br /><br />If I had a time machine I would go back to 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century cesspool we have now
Lapyuta (Castle in the Sky), more than any of Hayao Miyazaki's movies, brings the joy of storytelling to the audience
It is the kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid again; it's just magical
It's a crime that it took this long for it to be released in the states, but now that it's here check it out! And stick with the original language; the dub changed my impressions of the characters somewhat, which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie (or book, whatever
This is one of those movies that's difficult to review without giving away the plot
Suffice to say there are weird things and unexpected twists going on, beyond the initial superficial "Tom Cruise screws around with multiple women" plot
<br /><br />The quality cast elevate this movie above the norm, and all the cast are well suited to their parts: Cruise as the irritatingly smug playboy who has it all - and then loses it all, Diaz as the attractive but slightly deranged jilted lover, Cruz as the exotic new girl on the scene and Russell as the fatherly psychologist
The story involves elements of romance, morality, murder-mystery, suspense and sci-fi and is generally an entertaining trip
<br /><br />I should add that the photography is also uniformly excellent and the insertion of various visual metaphors is beautiful once you realize what's going on
<br /><br />If you enjoy well-acted movies with twists and suspense, and are prepared to accept a slightly fantastic Philip K Dick style resolution, then this is a must-see
I personally watched this to see the footage of the 60's and 70's
It was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially started and became pop culture and an eventual uncompromising force in life
The interviews of the classic rock stars are titillating and humorous
You feel like you're in on a secret and nodding your head at the same time
I loved it, all segments from 60's-present day
I highly recommend this for all aspects, including rock music, the hipper movement, politics and good 'ol history
I check marked the box saying this contains a spoiler, only because I have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regards, since I discussed what's in all 4 segments, so just wanted to be safe
Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment is without a doubt ***** stars on first view, its a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature
This movie gets right to the point, you may be thinking what point? The point is to satisfy fan's of just extreme violence and gore
This movie has some gore, more or less just torturing a women violently
There are really only 3 scene's that could be considered gore
I'll tell you one thing though Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment makes Hostile look like Sesame Street
If you thought Hostile was a crazy brutal disturbing torture flick then you ain't seen the half of it until you've seen Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment
<br /><br />Movie Rating 0-5, Gore 0-10<br /><br />Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment (Uncut) ***** (7
Blandings Builds His Dream House" 10/10 due to an aspect that makes us in the 21st century cringe a little bit: the fact that a black person is the faithful servant (somewhat reminiscent of Stepin Fetchit)
Portraying middle class New York couple Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy) trying to build a house in Connecticut, this flick has something for everyone
<br /><br />Grant is his usual flippant self, while Loy does quite well as merely a wife
But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughs as Jim's and Muriel's lawyer Bill Cole, who seems to have more plans than he's making clear
throughout most of the movie, you'll probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there
The builders, contractors, and others also provide their fair share of laughs
Also starring Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr
The summer has been so full of Blockbusters and comebacks of films, and not to mention some of the disappointments of those comebacks, that I was woe to find a film I could just sit down and enjoy
<br /><br />In case you don't want to read further down the page (there aren't any spoilers), I'll sum it up here: It's more mature than Ella Enchanted (there are some questionably violent parts, plenty of death, and a handful of scenes with a little blood, not for small children), but doesn't try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds
Think of it as a bit more serious, bit more magical Princess Bride, and you'll be close
<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I am, perhaps, not as prodigious a movie goer as others
Maybe once or twice a month, if I feel active
I get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10, and this film is the diamond in the rough
<br /><br />By the end here (August), I was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that I averted seeing Bourne Ultimatum in favor of Stardust
Having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by Transformers for my Fiction addiction, the previews of Stardust seemed appealing, but I was certainly wary
<br /><br />As many others here, I was utterly surprised
I had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichéd from here to breakfast
Don't be fooled, it is most definitely a fairy-tale, and it does indeed have witches, magic, and utterly requires suspension of disbelief
But the most refreshing thing I found, is that it's NOT based on anything I've seen or read in the past 15 years, and it's actually a really good movie
<br /><br />((Unlike 90% of the other movies which seem to persistently re-appear like thorns in a side, perhaps a sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas? I could read a book this year, and in two years the movie would be out as another "Epic fantasy tale, the likes of LotR and the rest" so says the NYT and such and such no doubt
))<br /><br />Stardust didn't have me bolted to my seat because of jam-packed action at every turn, nor was I sweating bullets because of plot-hook after plot-hook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom
It didn't even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to what's happening on screen (Transformers, I'm looking at you)
It's not trying to show off the latest CGI techniques, nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough I could've figured them out in 3rd grade (boy I hate those)
Watched, and enjoyed a refreshingly CREATIVE storyline unfold before my eyes
Sure, I may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film, but it makes you forget that
It even made my heart twinge at some parts, but the most important aspect I noticed is that I left the theater feeling better than when I'd gone in
After so much slush this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations, this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work I'd done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my money's worth
<br /><br />It's probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; If you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone (Princess Bride, Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, etc
This little diamond is finding its way into my DVD collection the moment it hits stores, you can trust me on this
I recently caught up with this little gem of a film on cable
It took me by surprise, even though, I should have expected it from the team involved with this movie
<br /><br />Henry Bromwell directed this film with a sure hand, and it shows
One always wonders about the secret life of hit killers
One doesn't have to go too far to realize they probably are one's own neighbors, or social acquaintances, or even friends; they're no different from us, at least on the surface
<br /><br />In this story, the grandfather, is a despicable character who does not hesitate in eliminating anyone for the right price
He has no scruples in teaching the ropes to his own son, and even to the grandson!<br /><br />Alex, is a man living in turmoil
He knows what he has done in the past and suddenly is coming to realize the consequence of his actions
He has to see someone to help him find peace with himself
Parks, he is trying to find absolution, although, he doesn't find it there
On the contrary, there is a dramatic twist when Alex learns about who is supposed to kill next
<br /><br />Alex, brilliantly portrayed by William H
Not only is he a fantastic actor, but he makes us believe he is that man
One of the best things in the movie is the late John Ritter
<br /><br />Donald Sutherland, as the grandfather is perfect
He is a natural actor in everything he does
Neve Campbell surprised in her pivotal role of Sarah
She shows a capability and range that are incredible
Tracey Ullman is Martha, the suffering wife, and she doesn't get to do much
Also Barbara Bain, in a rare appearance, is the grandmother from hell
I only click on his remake documentary to see Wei Wei, the original actress back in the classic 1948 film say a few words to the crew
We are going to meet Wei Wei this Sunday (28/3/2010) after the showing of Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun in the Hong Kong Film Archiev
Wei Wei is almost 90 years old in silver hair, her cameo appearance in Hong Kong films is always a surprise to her fans
In this year's Hong Kong Film Festival, a special program is dedicated to Fei Mu, director of this epic movie and Wei Wei's still shot from the movie is being seen all around in Hong Kong
My son, who turns 21 this year, is surprised Wei Wei was so beautiful then
I was about seven/eight years old when it was on
I still remember the 1st episode which was called "The New House
" It scared the h*ll out of me! I can almost still hear that statue, laughing madly
And the ending, oh my God! The hooror spirit comes in the room for the child: Yikes! This was classic TV and it was a one of a kind series
I have found a DVD collection for sale on the internet: 2 actually
My question to any readers: Has anyone purchased this set? Its a bootleg
Both sellers claim to have very good copy
I have a sketchy and poor DVD of "The New House" episode, and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better,however, if anyone knows if these are much clearer it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids
A great series, clever, scary and daringly supernatural
Thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this- In fact, I'd love to discuss it
Sogo Ishii has taken the old myth of Musashibo Benkei and stood it on its head to produce a dark, gory, spellbinding and terrific-looking movie
Those unfamiliar with the legend won't need to be; the story explains itself nicely as it goes along
Well worth seeking out even though there are no English-language home video versions
This first part of the BRD Trilogy has more passion and plot density than Lola, but less of the magic of Veronica Voss
The political musings have point to them: we see the shortages after the war, how the blackmarketers were able to control so much of the day-to-day life (delicious moment when Fassbinder, playing a grifter, tries to sell a complete set of Kleist to Schygulla, who remarks that burning books don't provide much warmth: she really wants firewood)
<br /><br />There's some clumsiness in the first hour
The scene in Maria's room with the black soldier, interrupted by Hermann's appearance should go quicker
The train scene when Maria meets Karl Oswald falls flat when she insults the GI--I cringed, it was so bad
But as the story develops and the years go by, I was drawn more and more into this glossy, cold world
In Mexico this movie was aired only in PayTV
Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life, is a true example about a good German and specially, about a good man
The conversations between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor are specially interesting
A true ideas' war: two different Germans, both with faith in there believes
Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: man, freedom fighter, boyfriend, churchman and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is outstanding as Bonhoeffer
I recommended this film a lot, specially in this difficult times for the planet
In Mexico we don't know a lot about Pastor Bonhoeffer life and legacy, this is a great work for rescue a forgotten hero
Jeremy Northam's characterization of the stuttering, mild mannered bookish Morgan Sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spell of Lucy Liu's presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch
His offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit, done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face, neck and lips
No matter the brainwashing, love has a way of persevering
Love also cannot be "brainwashed in" with either of his two fake wives
In gradual stages, he begins to dispense with his glasses, to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the movie progresses
The music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and appropriately driving at times
The extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi "film noir" in the tradition of many classic thrillers
I would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in Lucy Liu's portrayal, whenever she sees him in his various frazzled states, the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith, some restrained vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less one dimensional performance on her part
She is just no match for Northam's talents, but all in all I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would enjoying knowing about other screenplays written by the same author
The story and music (George Gershwin!) are wonderful, as are Levant, Guetary, Foch, and, of course, Kelly
One thing's missing, and that thing is a good leading lady
Anyway, despite her, the plot moves along nicely with the famous (and deservedly so) Ballet
Oh the colours, the dazzling reds, blues, greens, and yellows
; ) I just adore the contrast between the Beaux Arts Ball (completely black and white costumes) and the ever-so-brilliant Ballet
<br /><br />So I suppose what I'm trying to say is this: Please, by all means see it, and enjoy it, because though it isn't the best, it is MARVELOUS
But be sure not to forget that other Gene Kelly musical with the 20 year old girl that was catapulted to stardom just afterward
This would have been my number one movie of the year for 1991, except it got beat out by the brilliant JFK
This is such a wonderful movie! I loved it
I love stories where different characters' lives intersect with others and how deal with their lives
Kevin Kline is good here, but is outshined by Danny Glover and, especially, Steve Martin
I've never much like Martin or his style, but here he is great
I loved the whole speech he gave to Kline near the end about the Grand Canyon
Larry Kasdan is, IMO, a great dialogue writer, along the ways of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino
Here, he has formed several three-dimensional characters and well thought out storylines, and messages that give a positive feel to our lives
so, being a fairly deep fan of horror movies, it's been a while since i've seen one that really made me jump (or fidget nervously
)<br /><br />definitely going to get this on DVD when it comes out
the thing that i don't get is that so many people that we talkd with after the movie thought that it was horrible, well, if that's what you think, then so be it
i know what i liked and it takes a fair amount to get me to actually feel scared, so i have to say that this one is worth watching
<br /><br />now, you might be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and tidy line, because the plot goes back an forth a little bit to help build the story (i think that if it was shown in chronological order, it would have ruined the whole thing
)<br /><br />i'm actually glad that this movie had very little bloody messes in it
maybe the rest of you studio writers and whathaveyous will realize that you don't have to splash the red stuff all over the set to make people afraid
Musings: Pure delight from beginning to end
Not a laugh riot, but a more subtle, sophisticated humor
What a goldmine of great scenes and character actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr
<br /><br />Cary Grant is at the building sight of his new home, which is at that point, being framed
A young carpenter, played by future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his "lallies to be rabbeted", or some such thing that only a carpenter would know
Grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, replies in the affirmative
At that, Barker yells up to his mates, "OK boys, he wants 'em rabbeted, so
YANK 'EM OUT!" A second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards
You'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home, and a place like that, in Connecticut of all places, would probably run a few million bucks
<br /><br />A classic movie that is really a treasure
I saw the movie recently and really liked it
This movie is in the same niche genre as "Away from Her" - or even "The Bucket List" but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity
It's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as Hagar
The director does a masterful job with the challenge
Her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all
<br /><br />The first scene gets this across without any compromise
Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law
She figures it out en-route and freaks out
I didn't like her - not even a little bit
<br /><br />Throughout the course of the movie, we get insight
We find out why she doesn't like petunias, why she favors one son over the other, how her losses have formed her character
I especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack
Ellen Burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor
What a scene!<br /><br />This isn't a "feel good" movie, but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy
I understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect, they are there for a reason
<br /><br />Hagar isn't my mother - she isn't even my mother-in-law or neighbor
but parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life
Those parts somehow make more sense to me now that I've watched The Stone Angel
I enjoyed Still Crazy more than any film I have seen in years
A successful band from the 70's decide to give it another try
They start by playing some gigs in some seedy European venues, with hilarious results
The music is fantastic, the script and acting are terrific
The characters are spot on, especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice, makeup and personality problems
Go and see it, preferably in a cinema with a good sound system :
Hardly the dorky kids movie as noted, i still come back to this 10 years after i first saw it
<br /><br />The animation while not perfect is good, camera tricks give it a 3D feel and the story is still as good today even after i grew up and saw ground-breakers like Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon
It has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view
It's a story to entertain, not to question
<br /><br />Still one of my favourites I come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted animes
Not to say its a childish movies, there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all
Does anyone know, where I can see or download the "What I like about you" season 4 episodes in the internet? Because I would die to see them and here in Germany there won't be shown on TV
I already have seen episode 4 and episode 18 on YouTube
But I couldn't find more episodes of season 4
Is there maybe a website where I can see the episodes? Because I've read some comments in forums from Germany and there were people which had already seen the season 4 episodes even though they haven't been shown at TV in Germany
I am happy about every information I can get
William Powell is a doctor dealing with a murder and an ex-wife in "The Ex-Mrs
Bradford," also starring Jean Arthur, Eric Blore, and James Gleason
It seems that Powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom he was teamed
Though he and Myrna Loy were the perfect screen couple, the actor made a couple of other "Thin Man" type movies, one with Ginger Rogers and this one with Arthur, both to very good effect
<br /><br />Somehow one never gets tired of seeing Powell as a witty, debonair professional and "The Ex-Mrs
B served with a subpoena for back alimony and then moves back in to help him solve a mystery that she's dragged him into
And this isn't the first time she's done that! It almost seems as though there was a "Bradford" film before this one or that this was intended to be the first of a series of films - Mr
B complains that his mystery-writer ex is constantly bringing him into cases
This time, a jockey riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off the horse and dies right before the finish line
<br /><br />The solution of the case is kind of outlandish but it's beside the point
The point is the banter between the couple and the interference of the ex-Mrs
Jean Arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny
However, with an actress who comes off as brainy as Arthur does, the humor seems intentional rather than featherbrained
I suspect the writer had something else in mind - say, the wacky side of Carole Lombard
When Arthur hears that the police have arrived, she says, "Ah, it's probably about my alimony
I've been waiting for the police to take a hand in it," it's more of a rib to Powell rather than a serious statement
It still works well, and it shows how a good actress can make a part her own
<br /><br />Definitely worth watching, as William Powell and Jean Arthur always were
How amazing this film is! I've seen it over and over throughout the years and I'm always spellbound by it
The reason why the film is so easy to re-watch is, of course, the arresting performance given by the young Bette Davis
She not only steals every scene that she's in, but is actually much prettier and better photographed here (not to mention sexier) than she was in any of the films that she had made thus far at her home studio, Warner Brothers (this film was made by R
She wears a very flattering make-up and has very attractive hairstyles and oh, those lovely big eyes (especially, in the restaurant scenes that take place in London's Soho)
Get a load of it in the cheap negligee that she wears for her big explosive confrontation scene with Leslie Howard
And oh boy, she is an absolute powerhouse in that scene
Howard is a little too nervous throughout, but he does captures the hero's sensitivity
Frances Dee scores as the sweet, pretty young Sally who truly loves him
Max Steiner's score is both charming and poignant
Splendid performances and thirties flavor make this the must see version of the classic novel
I just saw this film at the 2001 Toronto international film festival
Some people found the graphic sex and realistic violence to be too much for them
Others seemed to genuinely appreciate how good this film was
<br /><br />This film isn't for the faint of heart
It's like 'Happiness' with explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity
There's animal poisoning, a strip-tease from a senior citizen, an orgy'esque' bathouse in a shopping centre, anal candle penetration, and the molestation of the mentally incompetent
<br /><br />If any of this sounds like too much to handle then this film isn't for you
This film shows humanity at its most desperate and pathetic
The banality of our existence is shoved in our face with utmost glee
<br /><br /> Seidl has no interest in redeeming humanity here
And why should he? This film features excellent performances from all involved, is always interesting, and is probably the most intelligent social statement to be made on film in awhile
One of the best Tarzan films is also one of its most action packed (and graphic)
<br /><br />Picking up a year or so after Tarzan the Ape Man, Niel Hamilton's Holt has asked a rich friend to finance a safari back to the elephants graveyard to collect ivory
His Friend arrives also carrying dresses and perfumes that Holt hopes to use to win Jane back from Tarzan
Before they can leave Holt finds his map stolen and it becomes a mad dash to try and capture a competing expedition
When they finally over take the thieves they find the whole party dead and themselves surrounded
They have no choice but to fight their way out and soon find they are out of the frying pan and into the fire
Eventually Tarzan and Jane show up and everyone is off on even more adventures
<br /><br />Infamous film was heavily censored to reduce the graphic violence (Its graphic even by todays standards
It probably would get a PG 13) and to remove all hint of nudity, (there is a several minute long nude swim scene involving Jane that is full frontal in its nudity, it was only recently restored)
Its clear watching the restored version why this film was reduced by 20 minutes in its run time for TV
As it stands in its restored version this is a very adult film that is romantic, touching, action filled and everything else that a movie should be
Its an amazing film by almost any standard
Best of all its the sort of film that plays well both as a stand alone adventure, one need not to have seen the first film to enjoy it, but its also a film that deepens the characters and themes that were set up in that original film
<br /><br />I really like this film a great deal
<br /><br />If there are any flaws to the film, its perhaps that the film hasn't aged well
The rear screen is often very obvious, there are gorilla suits for many of the apes and some of the other effects are more quaint rather than convincing
However on almost every other level this film is top notch
<br /><br />You really owe it to yourself to see this
Make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and curl up on the couch and just let yourself drift back to a simpler time
The opening sequence alone is worth the cost of admission, as Cheech and Chong drag that big ol garbage can across the parking lot, filled with gas
And then, as 'the plot' ensues, you're in for one heck of a ride
I watched this film recently and it holds up, being just as funny upon each viewing
AG was an excellent presentation of drama, suspense and thriller that is so rare to American TV
Sheriff Lucas gave many a viewer the willies
We rooted for Caleb as he strove to resist the overtures of Sheriff Lucas
We became engrossed and fearful upon learning of the unthinkable connection between these two characters
The manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear what Lucas would do next were truly surprising
This show lived up to the "Gothic" moniker in ways American entertainment has so seldom attempted, much less mastered
The suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show
This show puts shame to the current glut of "reality" shows- which are so less than satisfying viewing
This show is quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing
A public that is tiring of over-saturation of mind-numbing reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling
Hayao Miyazaki name became prominent with Spitied Away, however what is often overlooked are director's first film efforts
Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel or George Lucas directed THX 1138? I remember seeing fragments of this movie - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in late 80s and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation
So when I found a copy in a well known store for £9 I couldn't resist but buy it
The odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not tally with my memory of it (memory is funny that way)
<br /><br />Viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists portfolios is how very like Jean 'Moebius' Giraud some of the artwork is
<br /><br />When Pazu catches a falling girl (Sheeta) his adventure really begins - the quest for Laputa - a reference to Jonathan Swift's overlooked portion of Gulliver's Travels
With healthy references to Jules Verne it's a basic good vs
bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on Laputa
<br /><br />This is the portion that is strongest in my memory - the 'pastoral' ecological aspect of Laputa returned to nature - the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree
This is, in my opinion, the highlight of the movie - the views of the surface of Laputa, as opposed to the mechanised underground
<br /><br />Although this is the dichotomy of this movie - to show that even technology cannot overcome nature - the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animals
The ending of the movie Silent Running is almost exactly the same
<br /><br />It is incredibly stylish, I would not say 'slick' - very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings, airships and the design and look of just about everything
<br /><br />Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japnanese anime
When a movie shocks you with it's disturbing, brooding atmosphere, and grabs you by the throat with it's stunning cinematography, you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat, masterpiece of a film
Although with most modern movies, extremely enjoyable as some are, those that really shock you into focus are the strongest, and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly, stick with you for a life time
I say, proudly, that I am a fan of movies that disturb, not just horror movies, but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding
Movies like Breakdown and The Missing, that send a chill down your spine, making you think "holy crap, that could happen to me", and visually entice you, are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie
Because I am only 21, I did not grow up with actors like Burt Renyolds, Jon Voight and Ned Beatty, albeit I am familiar with them, I didn't watch them grow and proceed as actors, as opposed to actors now like Shia LaBouf and Justin Long
I must say, after the long hype and witnessing Deliverance for the first time, I was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago, and still lives it's terror up in competition to modern movies
Burt Renyolds plays Lewis, the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made, filling the whole wilderness in water
Renyolds' character is an experienced adventurer, sort of no nonsense, and filled with machismo
Witnessing him portray the tough guy, made me think differently about him as an actor, as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician
The dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader
Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty play as the novice adventurers, Drew and Bob respectively, joining in for the fun of a canoe trip
The actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was Jon Voight, once again I have only seen him as an older actor, however, unlike Renyolds, I have quite liked Voight's acting (and i don't regard Anaconda when I say that), for example the national treasure movies
Voight plays Ed, whom, like Lewis, is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character, a reluctant hero/ leader and definitely lacks Lewis' machismo
The film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside
You immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to, like the imbred kid who plays the infamous "Duelling Banjo's" at the start of the film with Ronny Cox's character Drew; and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene
As with all atmospheric movies, from this moment on, dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form
The canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and nature's odds for survival
The film's cinematics do not let up, and I back that comment up with the scene in which Ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow
As Ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him, cocks his rifle, only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck; was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting I have seen in a film
In wrapping up, Deliverance is one film, who's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date, remains one of the best films in cinematic history
The only reason I saw this movie was for Jimmy Fallon, who I've had a crush on since 9th grade, which was his first year on SNL
I am a die-hard Yankees fan, and I didn't find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes, when they begin showing clips of the ALCS games
I had to cover my ears and make small noises so I wouldn't have to hear that which must not be heard, but otherwise it was completely bearable
<br /><br />I thought Jimmy played the role very well, because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky, and he is a nervous and quirky guy
I know that it may not be a Academy Award-winning stretch, but the movie is just a light, fun, romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to see
<br /><br />Jimmy and Drew worked well together, and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past
(Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie? What?) I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him, and thank goodness, because Taxi could have killed it
I think Fever Pitch will help him out a lot
Everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies
I imagine it must be difficult, and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc) you'll see that they started off in some flops
Busom Buddies? Australian soap operas? Here's wishing Jimmy a successful career on screen
I never wanted him to leave SNL but what can you do
What the movie The 60s really represents (to those of us who growled around in the belly of America in those times) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade
Despite the exaggerated, stereotyped characters, the genuineness of the issues remains clear
<br /><br />Not only were those radical times of change, but also very confusing times
Two basic things changed our world then: the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and the overwhelming influence of the media
Those two new freedoms began social changes that soon became institutionalized
<br /><br />From chaos came sensitivity, from disorder came values
Bear in mind however, that the bulk of Americans were not involved in this
they worked, they played, they watched the news
and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities
the Civil Rights workers, the Political Activists, the Anti-War efforts, the War on Poverty
<br /><br />The representation of the power of the press and TV in particular, was well reflected, although the conflict between the general public's attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored
Middle class Americans weren't all standing around angrily holding baseball bats, or disowning their wayward daughters
Let us not forget how Folk Singers suddenly became Protest Singers, and how The Beatles began an onslaught that killed the Folk-Protest Movement
There are no Beatle songs in the movie, or even any mention of them
<br /><br />I think if you didn't live the decade, you might not have a sense of what the movie is about, the overall picture is a bit dim
At one point I held down a steady job while my sister lived at the Hog Farm Commune and went to Woodstock
At another point I was in Haight Asbury and in the Detroit Riots while she worked and played the housewife in Maine and Connecticut
<br /><br />The movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family
They represent the hippie child, the political activist, and the active military personnel
Dad represents the typical attitudes, and mom represents the voice of reason, tolerance, and sometimes compromise
<br /><br />The Black family comprises a minister and his son
I assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations, or else the film would have become a long, boring, documentary
Dad's message was that anger produces bitterness, and bitterness produces chaos
It was clearly a message directed to today's youth
<br /><br />We are looking at a unique solution to social problems, and also how issues divide us
The 60s were unusual in that way, and only the Roaring 20s compare
In other words, this movie has a moral after all
In the end, it is our Collective Individualism that survives
<br /><br />Everyone was a God, a Guru, or a free-spirited genius in the 60s
At least we can say we are not ashamed of it, that we learned and grew from it, and that for once, a generation shaped and changed America
I liked Eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done
He wasn't The smart, cocky, know it all he usually plays
The fact that it shows there are stranger things in Heaven and on earth than we can think of gives me hope

Absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson
<br /><br />The film won and Oscar for George E
Stoll's score, and it garnered nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly, and Best Cinematography, as well as a Best Son nomination for "I Fall in Love Too Easily" sung by Sinatra
<br /><br />It was a cute story about Kelly helping his pal Sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself
The lovely Grayson (The Toast of New Orleans) dazzled us with her singing, and we had a lot of great songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the artistry of pianist-conductor José Iturbi
<br /><br />A classic Hollywood music from an era gone by
I was absolutely mesmerised by this series from the moment Tom Long walked into shot - the whole 'bad boy' thing, it was just addictive
<br /><br />The story has you hooked, what will happen next - will Joey get the girl in the end, after doing 5 years in prison, and all that time thinking about his lost love, crossing paths with her again, finding he has a son
Although he is a violent bad guy, you still want him to find happiness
<br /><br />A truly captivating two parter - please bring it out on video
Got to be one of the best political satires I have seen to date, with an excellent performance for Cusak, Tomei, and all the supporting actors
<br /><br />Excellent plot, very well-placed and a very good unexpected twist at the end
The action scenes were well filmed & choreographed
<br /><br />All in all I give this film a big thumbs up
It's extremely critical of US military intervention in the middle-east, and as such, it may receive bad reviews from people who don't share the same political view, or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate the dark and drk humour
Indeed, at places, the comedy was so close to the truth that it was borderline between funny and tragic
ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK (1988)<br /><br />directed by: James Signorelli<br /><br />starring: Cassandra Peterson, W
Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Greene, and Edie McClurg<br /><br />plot: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) quits her TV show and heads to the small Christian town Fallwell, Massachusettes to collect on her dead aunt's inheritance, hoping to make big bucks to open up a show in Vegas
Unfortunately for her, all she gets is a creepy old house, a poodle, and a magic cookbook
While in Fallwell, Elvira tries to make money, breathe some life into the teenagers, win the heart of a stud (Daniel Greene), avoid being burned at the stake, and keep the cookbook from her creepy uncle (W
Morgan Sheppard), who is planning to use the book to end the world
<br /><br />my thoughts: I love both Cassandra Peterson and her alter-ego Elvira
She is a very successful, beautiful, and funny woman and as Elvira she's all that plus morbid and hilariously naive, not to mention she has an amazing pair of knockers
In this movie, her charms are put to good use
<br /><br />I loved the whole 'fish out of water' feel to the film
You got Elvira, with her low-cut black dress, her big black hair, and her enormous 'twins', and she's in a Christian town where most of the girls aren't even allowed to wear makeup
This also makes her love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) a lot more entertaining
Morgan Sheppard is equally great as Elvira's uncle/nemesis Vincent, out to steal the book to use it for evil
He has a lot of presence but still doesn't get in the way and steal scenes from Elvira
<br /><br />What really makes the film is not the plot, but the many jokes
Everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a SCARY MOVIE sequel
I hear there are about 56 boob jokes in this film, and any fan of Roger Corman B-horror flicks will love the spoofing in this film
<br /><br />If you love Elvira, you will love this flick
FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF films
Its influence was felt for more than a decade
However, certain elements relating to how this wide-screen entertainment was aimed at a mid-fifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit, and the film's sometimes sluggish pacing doesn't help
But, the story's compelling central idea involving the ancient,extinct Krell civilization and "monsters from the Id" hasn't lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant "must see" movie
What I'm mostly interested in saying here is that the current DVD for this movie is terrible
The movie has never really looked that good on home video and it's elements are in dire need of restoration
I hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this SF classic
This could be the most underrated movie of its genre
I don't remember seeing any advertisements or commercials for this one which could be the reason why it didn't do so well at the box office
However, Frailty is an excellent and a truly original horror movie
I rank it within the top 10 most favorite horror movies on my list
<br /><br />Movie begins with snapshots of photos and news articles telling us about a killer who calls himself "God's hand"
And then a man walks into a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother
Two of them leave together to go to a location where victims are buried which might help solve the case
During that trip, the man begins telling the story of his brother and we go back in time when the events began
Fenton and Adam are two young brothers living with their strict and religious father who, one day, claims that he has received a divine message from God asking him to kill the demons that appear to be regular human beings
He receives from God a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his sons to help him carry out this divine mission
<br /><br />This is an absolutely horrifying and suspenseful film that will keep you at the edge of your seat
The tension runs high, innocent people (or demons?) get killed and religious experiences are questioned
It has not one but few very intelligent twists at the end
If you like this genre, I highly recommend Frailty for you
I own the DVD and it is one of my all time favorite horror-thrillers
This film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film (along the lines of Tales from the Crypt) written by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho)
It's good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast
The movie should also be required viewing for Doctor Who fans since Jon Pertwee (the third Doctor) has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star
A meteor drops from the sky and reawakens a plesiosaur that long ago used to terrorize the area around Crater Lake
As the monster eats the locals they try and find away of killing the monster
<br /><br />Recent attempts at sending up old horror and science fiction films like Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass are kind of rendered moot when you have films like Crater Lake Monster available for screening
It's the sort of film that those films spoof and send up only this is the real deal
Its everything those films try to be only with out the tongue in cheek and its so much more fun because of it
This is a real drive-in sort of film that had the unfortunate luck of coming just as Star Wars changed the way we look at special effects
The monster, a mix of stop motion and a life size head, is a charmingly quaint little beast
The filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its mayhem
Sure its clear that its all fake, but isn't movies about suspension of disbelief? Actually I think its about really cool monsters, which this has
<br /><br />I like this movie in a low budget drive in sort of a way
If you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look no farther
This would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar lake monster films (Boggy Creek etc
This is the best movie I`ve ever seen !!! Thomas Beckett & Richard Miller -two mankinds who want to survive in the "jungle" of violence and madnes, one shot - one killed !!? You must kill, if you getting doubt about something, YOU MUST SURVIVE !!<br /><br />P
- I appologise of my bad / worst/ English !!
quote by Nicolas Martin (nicmart) from Houston, TX: "Fine film, but DVD "reformatted for TV", 8 April 2002 - This is a charming and emotive film
On the other hand, the DVD I purchased has been "reformatted to fit your TV" by the clods at Columbia Tristar
There is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format, except that Hollywood treats all films like the moronic, disposable trash that it is so used to producing
"<br /><br />What a (criminal!) shame indeed
However, there is another version out though
htm<br /><br />Wonderful performances by the two main actors (The King and Doggie) BTW
An unexpected pleasure as I had heard nothing about this film
<br /><br />Shameful since it warrants having a wider audience
<br /><br />A wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told, although admittedly predictable in its resolution
Beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film
<br /><br />My recent foray into Chinese film (Shower, The Road Home, Not One Less) has been an exciting one that I hope to continue exploring
China and its people is an amazing canvas for film-makers
"The King of Masks" can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent Chinese film
maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of "The Ramones" around the time the film was made
I've watched the film over and over, by myself and with friends, and it is still fresh and funny
At the risk of being too serious, the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless, and high school students boredom with drudgery of some classes is just as timeless
<br /><br />And, the film has some gem lines/scenes
references to how our "permanent record" in high school will follow us through life
(Let me assure you I've been out of high school for, uhhh, some years and it's not following me)
the famous "static" line ("I'm getting some static"
"Not as much as you're going to get", as Principal Togar approaches)
the school board member who is so decrepit he's attended by nurses
the Nazi Hall Monitors love for a "body search"
Principal Togar announcing, "I give you the final solution", and burning the Ramones records (note: records were what came before CD's)
and of course Joey Ramone noting, "Things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school", followed by Togar asking "Do your parents know you're Ramones?"<br /><br />Just one piece of advice
Dey Young, who was a major hottie in the film, today reminds us we all age
PJ Soles career never advanced as we might have expected
Marla Rosenfield, as one the other students, apparently appeared only in this film (one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the film), though I submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles
And, does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steele? <br /><br />So, watch and enjoy
Using three legends of the old west as its protagonists (they probably never met),Gary Cooper is portraying Wild Bill Hickock,James Ellison as Buffalo Bill and Jean Arthur does make a nice Calamity Jane
The story serves only for De Mille to hang some marvelous action sequences on, like the big Indian attack
If you don't mind the somewhat over-the-top performances of the cast this is an very entertaining western
Look out for a very young Anthony Quinn essaying the role of an Indian brave who participated at the battle of Little Big Horn
This part got him at least noticed in Hollywood
This is a very light headed comedy about a wonderful family that has a son called Pecker because he use to Peck at his Food
Pecker loves to take all kinds of pictures of the people in a small suburb of Baltimore, Md
, and manages to get the attention of a group of photo art lovers from New York City
Pecker has a cute sister who goes simply nuts over SUGAR and is actually an ADDICT, taking spoonfuls of sugar from a bag
There are scenes of men showing off the lumps in their jockey's with grinding movements and gals doing pretty much the same
It is rather hard to keep your mind out of the gutter with this film, but who cares, it is only a film to give you a few laughs at a simple picture made in 1998
When I first heard that Hal Hartley was doing a sequel to Henry Fool, I was excited (it's been a personal favorite for years now), and then wary when I heard it had something to do with terrorism
Having just seen it though, I was surprised to find that it worked, while still being an entirely different sort of movie than Henry Fool
The writing and direction were both dead on and the acting was superb
especial kudos go to Hartley for reassembling virtually the whole cast, right down to Henry's son, who was only four in the original
Like I said though, this movie is quite different from the first, but it works: I reconciled myself with the change in tone and subject matter to the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters would have found themselves in very different situations since the first film ended
In this case, an unexpected adventure ensues
not to mention the fact that I'll need to see it again to really understand what's going on and who's double crossing who
While it was certainly one of the better movies I've seen in some time, it suffers like many sequels with its ending, as it appears that Hartley is planning a third now and the film leaves you hanging
I'll be sure to buy my tickets for part 3 ('Henry Grim'?) in 2017
As you can see this is one of my favorite if not favorite films
This is a character drama which is absolutely hilarious
The main character is a business man who is stuck in a "same thing, different day" mentality
He sees a woman looking melancholy out a window of a dance studio from his train everyday and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her
He decides to join the dance class only to find out she is not the instructor
From there he bonds with four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing as well as finding out about the mysterious woman
<br /><br />There is no gratuitous (or any) sex involved, just how a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developed
<br /><br />This film was remade with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez and the new one while appealing is nowhere as enjoyable as the original
The movie never made it big in America because it was not eligible for the Oscars since it was broadcast on television in Japan (movies cannot be released on TV or they are disqualified for Oscar nominations)
It did win numerous awards in Japan for best film, cast, director etc for their "Oscar" awards
Don't know how this missed award nominations
Certainly of the calibre of "Beautiful Mind" Great acting, photography, script and drama
I can't imagine anyone not being entranced by this film
Here's a decent mid-70's horror flick about a gate of Hell in NYC that just happens to be an old brownstone
Seems like there's lots of gates of Hell around, but of course this unwitting model happens to decide she needs some space from her boyfriend/fiancée and so she just happens to pick one, which is disguised as a nice and reasonably priced apartment
She meets several strange neighbors, and even attends a birthday party for a cat
Upon meeting with the Realtor because she hears strange noises at night from upstairs, she finds out that she and an old priest are SUPPOSED to be the only tenants
Whoa! Then who are all these weirdos? Her boyfriend (a slimy lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) starts poking around and finds that things are not what they seem, not by a long shot
This has some decent creepy scenes and the idea of the creaky old folks that are her "sometimes" neighbors being other than what they appear is fairly intriguing
A bit of decent gore and even a parade of less-than-normal folks towards the end make this a decent watch, and while I've seen this many times on TV the uncut DVD version is much better, of course
Not a bad little horror flick, maybe a good companion piece to "Burnt Offerings"
This film is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called Grey Owl in 1930s Canada
I found it to be similarly riveting and heartfelt as 'Rudy' and 'Awakenings'
It picks up late in Grey Owl's life and follows him through his most tumultuous and influential period
<br /><br />The film is about a Canadian Indian trapper who finds himself promoting the plight of the over-trapped Beaver
He also predicts the decrease in natural lands and the overuse of Earth's resources
This is an outrageous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received
He becomes a well known speaker and the masses are ready to listen
<br /><br />The casting of Pierce Brosnan seems rather odd, but is not outrageous
Anyone wanting to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand
Brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does Annie Galipeau
Galipeau is a strong actress whose place beside Brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced pairings in recent Bond films
<br /><br />I would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama, beautiful scenery, or environmental causes
It is a movie for families as well, however children under 10 (depending on maturity) would have trouble following the plot
I now that these days, some people wan't see a movie without movie styling, so much Dogma, Lars Von, Watchosky Brothers, are changed what we expect in a movie, perhaps, Casomai is no-one-more-Independent-non-american movie, the movie take all movies resources and language to tell us a simple history about love and marriage, but much more
Fully of views, lectures and let you thinking
and I'm sure, you can't fell boried any second of a long 116 minutes
I calculate that don't have a single scene longer that 3 o 2 1/2 minutes
***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** After two so-so outings ("Magnum Force" and "The Enforcer"), Dirty Harry seems to have regained his stride in "Sudden Impact," a gripping thriller that wisely plays to its strengths: the charisma of Clint Eastwood, who also directed, and a story that spends just enough time on exposition and reserves its energy for the big scenes
<br /><br />For once, the case takes Harry outside his native San Francisco (where he's again in trouble with his superiors for his "shoot first, ask questions later" tactics), to the hamlet of San Paulo
There, (WARNING: Potential spoiler) a group of lowlifes is being gruesomely murdered, one at a time, by a woman whom they gang-raped years earlier, and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia ever since the attack
<br /><br />The killer is portrayed by Sondra Locke, and she makes the character of Jennifer Spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold-bloodedness
Locke's cold eyes and frosty voice, when either trying to comfort her hospitalized sister or dispensing vengeance toward the rapists, are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman wronged whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruit
<br /><br />The rapists are a despicable lot, especially the leader, who has "psycho nutjob" practically stamped on his forehead, and a lesbian who seems almost one of the guys, despite her anatomical inability to participate
The flashback scenes, while not graphically explicit, are nightmarish enough, and clearly intended to make the audience cheer for Jennifer as she kills her assailants
<br /><br />Some will dismiss "Sudden Impact" as trash: a mindless, manipulative revenge tale
On a certain level this is true, but it's well-done trash
What works to the movie's advantage is the strength of the Sondra Locke performance, giving us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech
What we have here is an action movie with a point of view
<br /><br />You can take or leave the idea that some wrongs deserve to be punished by any means necessary, but as the mystery behind the slayings becomes clear to Harry (a realization that, wisely, is not spelled out with dialogue), he is presented with a choice -- what to do about a killer whose motivations he can sympathize with but whose conduct he is bound by law to not tolerate
This makes the story more interesting than the usual Dirty Harry fare
<br /><br />The movie's other redeeming quality is Eastwood's direction
This is, after all, a Dirty Harry movie, and Eastwood knows the character better than anyone else
The movie is directed with style and wit, and edited to give the action scenes a big payoff
Some of the best "Harry moments" in the entire series are here, including Harry's best-known line, "Go ahead -- make my day
"<br /><br />"Sudden Impact" is a movie that has the courage of its convictions in presenting a tale about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow
It is also a riveting detective story, well made and well told
On those criteria, it succeeds tremendously
All Dogs Go To Heaven Is The Most Cutest Animated Film To Have Dogs In 1989
The Previous Don Bluth Film The Land Before Time(1988) Became A Success
Aw, I Just Want To Hug Them When They're Cute
Its Animation Is Beautiful, The Characters Are Great When They're Perfectly Voiced And The Songs Are Cute And Touching
It Opened In November 17 1989 The Same Date As The Little Mermaid Produced By Walt Disney Feature Animation
<br /><br />The Part Where Charlie Got Killed By Carface Was So Unforgivable
Carface Is So Mean Because He Wanted To Kill Charlie
Shame On Him! The Love Survive Song Performed By Irene Cara And Freddie Jackson Was So Beautiful
All Dogs Go To Heaven Is The Best Animated Movie Ever
A sequel to Angels With Dirty Faces in name only, The Angels Wash Their Faces suffers somewhat from the usual shenanigans of the Dead End Kids
As a matter of fact, with the presence of the Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan this should have been treated as an actual sequel to Angels With Dirty Faces, at least for continuity's sake
<br /><br />Speaking of Ann Sheridan, she is the one true shining light of this movie
To paraphrase a cliché, Ann Sheridan could read from a phone book for two hours and I would buy the DVD!<br /><br />Another virtue of this movie is the chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan
Unfortunately , this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background
For a better example of the Sheridan-Reagan duo I would recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row
I like films that don't provide the typical "happy ending," and that's my main reason for my liking of this movie
Alice Marano (Danes) and her best friend Darlene (Beckinsale) are arrested in Thailand for narcotics smuggling after a tip anonymously phoned in to the Thai authorities
The film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing as to whether (or which) of the girls was involved, and Bill Pullman is perfect as their sleazy lawyer
Jacqueline Kim turns in a terrific performance as his more kind, magnanimous wife, Yon, who is also an attorney
I wish the girls had been abused more in the prison, as another commenter has suggested, as I've heard that Thai prisons can be quite brutal
Where this film grabs me, however, is its ending
Alice subjects herself to a sentence of 96 years in total so that Darlene can be pardoned, and we (the viewers) realize that they are both innocent
Any film that defies my expectation of the ending wins extra points with me, and this well-acted drama is certainly deserving
When it came out, this was pretty much state of the art musical film entertainment
To this day it's more entertaining than most, in great part because it has James Cagney in the lead role as a musical prologue producer under a succession of deadlines and sheltered from all storms by his trusty "girl Friday" played by Joan Blondell
Also the musical numbers towards the end which were put together by Busby Berkeley are pretty much a knock-out as far as that type of thing goes
<br /><br />But this is a pretty strange movie
I mean in one of those numbers, you've got Billy Barty running around pretending to be a lovable toddler, doing all kinds of weird stuff
Ruby Keeler seems to have a sickening smile plastered on her face at all times, but at least she's not required to act like in some of her later unfortunate films
You'd never guess that Dick Powell was any kind of tough guy from seeing him in this movie; apparently all the tough guy energy was allocated to the star Cagney
As for Cagney, his high speed rants about musical shows and so forth are endearing and annoying at the same time
You expect him to walk out and say, "Hey! I've got a great idea for a prologue! The women are cigarettes, and they come out of a pack of smokes! Oh no, we did that one last month!" It's funny but it gets a bit repetitive
In the moments where he has to get tough with the bad girl, Ruth Donnelly, some of the established Cagney gangster character comes out
In fact frequent B gangster director William Keighley is credited here with dialogue coaching, and it seems at times that Cagney and Blondell are invoking something very "street" even though the characters aren't criminal
what can you say? They stand alone as entertainment, the way that Berkeley uses the human body and geometry is really startling
It means "Honeymoon Hotel", nothing really more or less
And the whole pretense of the integration falls apart immediately, since the characters in the show are doing things that couldn't possibly be appreciated by a theater audience like the movie portrays
For example at one point they show the fine print on a newspaper, things like that
The whole thing could only exist on film, so the idea that the prologues are actually live shows is ridiculous
I can only suppose that audiences of the time were somewhat less critical about things like this than they would be ten years later or so, because this is a very polished production
<br /><br />It's great to see Cagney himself show off his superb dancing skills, and he can actually share the stage with a dancer like Keeler
Cagney and Blondell have excellent chemistry and their scenes go off really well
The music I would say is only mediocre, but mostly pleasing if repetitive
Bacon's direction in general is very suitable but never interesting
The film's entertainment value is unquestionable and it has also picked up some nostalgic value along the way
It's a cut above most "let's put on a show" films of the 30s
This movie had a great ensemble of adult actors along with a cast of youthful actors that are going to be in movies for a long while if there is any justice
I may look up the book that this was adapted from, it must have been great
) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, and Tim Blake Nelson were a blast to watch! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis were not seen enough, but were fun when they were onscreen
The kids at the camp couldn't have been better
This was the best documentary I've ever seen!! I just saw Lords of Dogtown and wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta, and was surprised and happy to find out this was one of his films as well
Great Job Stacy! I was kicking back at work last week, bored O*&^%less and this movie came on
Growing up in Orange County in the 80's I surfed up and down the local beaches and so did my dad when he was a teenager
I grew up at the beach, my parents took me every weekend, I body surfed, boogeyboarded then moved up from there
It was way before my time but it was awesome to see what these guys went through
TRUE PIONEERS! This movie is a collectors item
basically, i like Verhoeven film because in his film, i enjoy a brilliant pscychosexual story that i have seen before in "Basic Instinct"
it is really a wonderful thriller i enjoyed very much
so it is obviously for me to watch this another Verhoeven movie
<br /><br />well, it is his previous direction before his block buster hit "Basic Instinct" and for that i was very much curious to watch that movie and yeah, the movie has fulfilled my hope and expectation
<br /><br />this movie "The Fourth Man" is a brilliant pscychosexual drama which is a lit bit complex for some audiences
the story of this movie is about a gay writer named "Reve"(Krabbe), an alcoholic person who is lives by his own moral values and sees many visions that may warn him from a future accident
after the end of his lecture, he introduce a seductive woman named "Christine", who has a mysterious past she doesn't want to reveal
Reve do sex with her at her house as she is a boy
next morning, he watch her sexy, macho boyfriend's picture on her table, the person he met at the station
he is curious to meet him and tell Christine to invite him to her house
i don't want to reveal the entire story because it is a Verhoeven movie and the end of the film is really surprising!<br /><br />especially, i like the character "Reve" which is brilliantly played by "Krabbe"
i basically like his acting because as a gay person i am purely identified with his character and yeah i like his charming face
<br /><br />i rate this movie: 10 out of 10
I was told it was one of those "either you love it or you hate it" movies
Obvious hippie-era, dated and easy symbolism and all
So, I probably have no taste at all when it comes to Antonioni, but this and La Notte (made exactly a decade earlier) are my favourites among his movies so far
Made two years before I was born, Zabriskie Point was supposed to have been Michelangelo's great American epic
But apparently, it turned out to be a flop
Before watching it I'd read that it was rather boring, so I braced myself for a very slow movie - though I love me a slow movie
For my taste, Zabriskie didn't have a tedious minute in it
While watching it, I made a mental note of how European it was on the director's part to make such frequent use of advertisement billboards in almost every urban scene, enormous billboards dwarfing any human form in sight
This recurrent visual element is obviously there to underline the way that consumerism crushes the individual in American society
But then I watched L'Eclisse straight afterwards, which is set in Rome in the early 60s, and noticed that Antonioni often included billboards in it as well
After all, the masterful use of landscapes, architecture and inanimate objects in each frame with or without human beings is an Antonioni trademark  this is precisely the way that he evokes his characters' psychological states, with more or less understated power and great visual impact
He is virtually unsurpassed in this skill
<br /><br />Zabriskie Point starred two very appealing leads that should have become big stars of the 70s, but never did
Mark Frechette, whom I'd already seen in Francesco Rosi's fine WWI-set movie Uomini Contro, had a very tragic life and died aged just 27
According to his biography page, he donated his $60,000 earnings from Zabriskie to a commune
Mark's co-star Daria Halprin, apparently also Dennis Hopper's wife later on, has the stunning, natural beauty and appeal of a young Ornella Muti  one of those luminous beauties that don't need a shred of make-up to turn heads
Like Frechette, she has only graced a couple of obscure movies and has never become a star, but at least she didn't die tragically
Most notably, Zabriskie Point contains one of the most original sex scenes ever filmed - one that brings home a sense of youthful playfulness like few I've seen - as well as a powerfully cathartic ending
It may be the most banal sequence ever filmed as far as its symbolism goes, but I can't see how anyone can deny its beauty and wonderful sense of emotional release
Never has an explosion looked so good, and so poetic
It seems to be an explosion that restores order rather than bringing chaos
It is rare that you find a comedy with levels, and this is a bloody good example of such
When I saw this movie first, as the credit rolled, a friend and I looked to one another and asked
'did you just catch that?' For those doubters, look at the levels
See the comparisons between Vick and the people in the club, the DNA! See the diverse characters, each jostling for position, and if you see nothing else, see the connection between the cure of Vick and the path through the film
IT'S ALL IN VICK'S HEAD! The opening line about Vick's world
The closing scene with the camera going into Vick's head, and inside, a whole universe! Thoroughly quotable, wonderful cartoon gangsters, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
His understated delivery is refreshing in a time of over the top performances
I liked the relationship between the father and son
The Wendigo looks silly, but it is a representation of the kid's toy and the dead deer
It's an amalgamation like, see? This is a psychological story, not a Freddy slash em up instant gratification flick
Watch it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie might have to say to you and you'll be fine
Well, what can I say, this movie really got to me, it's not so bad, as many say, I really loved it, although the idea seems so simple, and rather boring, it isn't
First of all I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it really goes with the movie
Second the simple story, and the drama of Spirit gets your attention
One thing I like the most is that they didn't give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses, it makes the movie more realistic, not many animations seem realistic now do they ?, but
I don't know, making animals talk is just so
<br /><br />One of the most beautiful animations of 2002 in my opinion, I recommend it to everyone, not just the kids :), because it is very relaxing
A very cute movie with a great background provided by the city of Boston and Fenway Park
As a baseball fan and light movie addict, it hit a homerun for me
Plenty of laughs and plenty of authentic baseball scenes with real ballplayers and real references to past Bosox failures
And how enjoyable was it to watch a movie with a baseball theme without having to endure an overage, over-the-hill, self-serving Kevin Costner attempting to make believers out of a critical audience? Jimmy and Drew did a fine job as a young love-struck couple suffering from Jimmy's Bosox "jones"
It was a bit whacky and out of left field, but there really are Sox fans that are that fanatic and live their lives through the fortunes of their beloved team
The movie coasted along at a fast pace and the ending, although predictable, had the charm and sentimentality of so many other popular movies, without being overly pretentious
<br /><br />Also enjoyable was the return of Willie Garson to the screen
I miss the forever-popular "Stanford Blatch" from Sex & the City
He's always funny, even when he does or says very little
<br /><br />So buy yourself two box seats, some popcorn, and get ready for a fun time
Much about love & life can be learned from watching the folks at THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER
<br /><br />Ernst Lubitsch had another quiet triumph added to his credit with this lovely film
With sparkling dialogue (courtesy of his longtime collaborator Samson Raphaelson) and wonderful performances from a cast of abundantly talented performers, he created a truly memorable movie
Always believing in playing up to the intelligence of his viewers, and favoring sophistication over slapstick, the director concocted a scintillating cinematic repast seasoned with that elusive, enigmatic quality known as the Lubitsch touch
'<br /><br />Although the story is set in Budapest (and there is a jumble of accents among the players) this is of no consequence
The beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any great American city or small town could easily be the locus for the action
<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart & Margaret Sullavan are wonderful as the clerks in love with romance and then with each other - without knowing it
Their dialogue - so adeptly handled as to seem utterly natural - perfectly conveys their confusion & quiet desperation as they seek for soul mates
Theirs is one of the classic love stories of the cinema
<br /><br />Cherubic Frank Morgan has a more serious role than usual, that of a man whose transient importance in his little world is shattered when he finds himself to be a cuckold
An accomplished scene stealer, he allows no emotion to escape unvented
Additionally, Morgan provides the film with its most joyous few moments - near the end - when he determines that his store's newest employee, an impoverished youth, enjoys a memorable Christmas Eve
<br /><br />Joseph Schildkraut adds another vivid depiction to his roster of screen portrayals, this time that of a toadying, sycophantic Lothario who thoroughly deserves the punishment eventually meted out to him
Gentle Felix Bressart has his finest film role as a family man who really can not afford to become involved in shop intrigues, yet remains a steadfast friend to Stewart
<br /><br />Sara Haden graces the small role of a sales clerk
William Tracy is hilarious as the ambitious errand boy who takes advantage of unforeseen developments to leverage himself onto the sales force
<br /><br />In tiny roles, Charles Halton plays a no-nonsense detective and Edwin Maxwell appears as a pompous doctor
Movie mavens will recognize Mary Carr & Mabel Colcord - both uncredited - in their single scene as Miss Sullavan's grandmother & aunt
There are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like Stardust did all throughout the course of the film
As magically fairy-tale-like as The Princess Bride, Stardust is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000's as well as the 1990's
Exciting, hilarious and equipped with wonderful imagery as well as unforgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro's especially, I challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile
From the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finish
<br /><br />Ten stars, and not a decimal less
I reached the end of this and I was almost shouting "No, no, no, NO! It cannot end here! There are too many unanswered questions! The engagement of the dishwashers? Mona's disappearance? Helmer's comeuppance? The "zombie"? Was Little Brother saved by his father? And what about the head???????" ARGH!! Then I read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and I have to say, I know it probably wouldn't be true to Lars von Trier's vision, but I would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned! Granted, it would be hard to find someone to play Helmer as the character deserves
Helmer, the doctor you love to hate! I think I have yet to see a more self-absorbed, oblivious, self-righteous character on screen! But, I could overlook a change in actors
Since Douglas MacArthur affected more human livesfor the betterthan any other American not elected President, he deserved a better film biography
<br /><br />Oddly enough, the potential was there
From the very early "Star Trek" episode "The Corbomite Maneuver" (1966) to the recent HBO films "Something the Lord Made" (2OO4) and "Warm Springs" (2OO5), director Joseph Sargent has emerged as one of the most expressively human directors in film, a man capable of subtly shaping the emotional shadings of his actors' performances, and carrying the audience exactly where he wants them to go
The producer, Frank McCarthy, also gave us "Patton" (197O), the legendary Jerry Goldsmith scored both films, and Universal widely touted the fact that the film was "four years in preparation and production
" Yet for all of this, "MacArthur" is perfectly adequateand not much more than that
<br /><br />The film begins in early 1942, shortly before the beleaguered general was orderedby President Franklin D
Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy)to flee the Philippines to avoid capture by the Japanese
Thus, this film omits: <br /><br />· MacArthur's birth in 188O in a frontier barracks in Arkansas still subject to attack by Native American tribesmenthus establishing that his remarkable life spanned the distance from bows-and-arrows to thermonuclear weapons; <br /><br />· his graduation from West Pointfirst in a class of 95, <br /><br />· how he joined his famous father, General Arthur MacArthur (who had earned the Medal of Honor at Missionary Ridge in the Civil War) on assignments in Japan, China and, most importantly, in the Philippines; <br /><br />· his heroic exploits in the 1914 excursion into Vera Cruz; <br /><br />· how he leaped about the trenches of World War One like a mountain goat, often wounded, and promoted with blinding speed to Brigadier General; <br /><br />· his postwar service as West Point's youngestand most progressivecommandant; <br /><br />· his participation in the court-martial of Billy Mitchell in 1924; <br /><br />· his routing of the Bonus Marchers in 1932; <br /><br />· his efforts to sustain a woefully-underfunded Army as Chief of Staff in the early 193O's; <br /><br />· his retirement from the U
Army to become Field Marshal (!) of the Army of the Philippines; <br /><br />· and the reactivation of his commission by FDR shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War
<br /><br />All this is omitted in favor of prolonged footage of MacArthur trying to fight off seasickness while being evacuated by PT boatthus, we know that "General Mac" is a legend, but not why; nor can we appreciate why the allegations of cowardice were so wounding to "Dugout Doug"and so patently unfounded
<br /><br />The remainder of his career is presently straightforwardly: His island-hopping "Hit 'em where they ain't" campaign, the fulfillment of his pledge to the Filipinos "I shall return!"his crowning achievement, the winning of the peace in postwar Japan, then the difference of opinion with President Harry Truman (a properly feisty Ed Flanders) over the conduct of the Korean conflict which resulted in his outright firing, and finally, his proclamation to Congress that "old soldierssimply fade away," after which he did just that
All quite historically accurate, and all presented with a very deliberate lack of commentary
<br /><br />Sargent and the producers almost painfully distance themselves from adorning the historical record with their own approval or disapproval: If MacArthur's actions appear noble, let them be presented as such; if they appear egotistical or bombastic, let those conceptions register sans comment
Since Joe Sargent is quite expert at subtly manipulating his audience's reactionsagain, see Warm Springsthis refusal to offer comment appears quite intentional
Historically, that may be commendable, but it almost defeats the efforts of the viewer to place this extraordinary man in any kind of rational perspective
<br /><br />And finally, there is a sort of "made on the cheap" feel to the film, as there is to "Midway," released about the same time
Both films were relegated to "television" directors--Sargent in this case, Jack Smight on "Midway," and both have a made-for-TV-look
Even Jerry Goldsmith's march, while perfectly serviceable, lack the subtle undertones and the grandeur of his "Patton" theme--just another way in which a larger-than-life man is memorialized by a very ordinary film
<br /><br />There was vanity and pettiness in this man, inarguably; there was also greatnessand love him or loathe him, one must acknowledge the fact that MacArthur did what no military commander before him had done: he won the peace
<br /><br />In the end, "MacArthur"like so many film biographiesis a good place to begin research into this remarkable man, but a poor place to end it
I saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary
What I love most about it is that it is understated and low-key, but deeply heartfelt
) performance is masterfully inarticulate (he is supposed to be a man of few words)
David Straithern is a wonderful crazy villain
And miraculously (given that we're talking about a Hollywood product here) a baby serves as a main character, but one who doesn't act or have lines, but rather just IS (& is luminous at that)
Interesting to note that Thomas' mysterious relationship w
was the core of that film; while his bond w
the baby serves as the core of "A Good Baby
"<br /><br />Then there is the music--ah, what music!! Gillian Welch's tunes are wonderful & the entire score is gorgeous hill country music
<br /><br />This film is wonderfully atmospheric
I first saw this absolutely riveting documentary in it's initial release back in 2001,and it really had a profound effect on me, so much that I bugged several of my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings
The bottom line:none of my friends walked away disappointed (ever!)
This stellar film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy,who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials (wood,water,flowers,rocks,etc
)to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?)
We get to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art,as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world,as well as a few pieces in the natural world,as well
German film maker,Thomas Riedelsheimer directs,photographs & edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real treat for both the eye & ear (with an ambient musical score,composed & performed by Fred Frith,who's music is generally edgy experimental/noise textured guitar,as well as a capable ensemble of musicians)
Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now,if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film,by all means,seek it out (it's easily a film that was composed for the large screen,with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way)
No MPAA rating,but contains nothing to offend (unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb
Lost is an extremely well made TV series about some people that are lost on an island
there's so many twists and turns that you can't really decide who your favourite character is, one minute its him then he does something so he's coolest then shes about to do something so shes the coolest then suspense builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like noooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!so you have to wait a whole week too see the next episode but it is worth the wait
Suspense, action, romance, humour its got it all apart from the topless girls but thats good as it means that you can actually concentrate on the story more and story is what this is all about
so if you like a good story and like suspense this is a good one however 24 i think is probably better
(i have a review on that too that you could check it out
) I would give lost a good 8 out of 10 mainly because its so unpredictable, you never know what will happen next
This is one of those movies that you happen across when you're channel surfing on a Saturday afternoon, and you get drawn into it and end up watching the whole thing
I thought that it was well acted and it really made me feel for the characters
Though it's a bit slow moving, focusing more on the relationships between Bonnie and Clyde and their family members, it never got boring
We don't really see too much of all the robberies that they were so legendary for, and instead most of the shootouts take place when they're ambushed by the police
I thought Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, really did a good job with her character
Going from a nice country girl to a cold-blooded killer is a challenging thing to portray, and I enjoyed the subtlety she brought to the role
<br /><br />Overall, an above average effort, especially considering it was a made for TV movie
If anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing, directing, and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in Italy and England
Other days, other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment, made in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson, and Michael Kitchens in the major roles
Under the brush stroke direction of Mike Newell, these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye
Reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century, this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character, and the viewer, too
An artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us
Any movie that shows federal PIGs (Persons In Government) to be the power-mad threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to me
<br /><br />Alas, the script supervision and editing and even, at times, the directing are flawed so there will be people who will disparage the whole movie and ignore the good moments
<br /><br />I saw the original way back when it was new and hated it, despised it, loathed it
Thought it was a terrible, irrational piece of junk
<br /><br />Now, though, I don't remember why
<br /><br />I believe the two should not be compared or even connected
<br /><br />Consider them as two different movies
<br /><br />Rate them as two different movies
<br /><br />This "Vanishing Point" provides a rallying place, a banner for people who want to encourage individualism, who believe in human rights, who recognize the threat to freedom government can be and is, especially the federal government
<br /><br />"The Voice" wears a cap bearing the state motto of New Hampshire: "Live Free or Die
" At one time it would have been the motto of most Americans
<br /><br />Despite its obvious flaws, "Vanishing Point" is a film to cheer
Janeway was able to do a double switch on the Borg was great
The fact that she allowed herself to be infected, thus infecting the Queen with a "poison" that in, essence, ended the Borg was great
The way they ended it also left some, not a lot, for a reunion movie
However, they did bring them "home" and the way they did it was fantastic!! It was sad to say good bye to a part of my family
Ending it with Tom and B'Lanna having their baby just as they enter the Alpha quad
It would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type - just to see where their characters would be today
I think this has the potential of being the best Star Trek series yet, I say POTENTIAL
we all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of ideas
BUT I HOPE NOT! For those that have not seen it
SEE IT! Without that annoying "PRIME DIRECTIVE" floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool
and Scott Bakula was without a doubt a GREAT CHOICE for Captain, and the Vulcan Babe is hot too, (Check out the decontamination scene)I gave this a FULL 10
it blows away ALL the other series openers
This zippy and fun short from 1916 - the time when Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle were the big names in comedy - features the young Oliver Hardy as a ne'er-do-well who has to quickly impress his wealthy uncle by producing a wife and baby for his visit
<br /><br />Of course this does not go smoothly and soon there are rather more wives and babies than he can cope with; plus the mandatory chases and misunderstandings that are the hallmark of early movie slapstick
<br /><br />Restored well it can be viewed as part of 'The Early Films of Oliver Hardy' and is now available on DVD, a fine addition to the available corpus of the big screen favourite comedy duo
The whole point of making this film, one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses
The general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly
Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals (a young Loren, handsome Della Marra, and a slinky Ms
Maxwell)who make the story much more believable, giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be
Altogether, an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi's great works
I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera, a form with which I was then not well acquainted
I still regard this film fondly and would recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals
Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames, and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films
If there was anything Akira Kurosawa did wrong in making Dodes'ka-den, it was making it with the partnership he formed with the "four knights" (the other three being Kobayaski, Ichikawa, and Konishita)
They wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership, and instead Kurosawa, arguably the head cheese of the group, delivered an abstract, humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies
Had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows, but it was because of this, among some other financial and creative woes, that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971
And yet, at the end of the day, as an artist Kurosawa didn't stop delivering what he's infamous for with his dramas: the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity
That its backdrop is a little more unusual than most shouldn't be ignored, but it's not at all a fault of Kurosawa's
<br /><br />The material in Dodes'ka-den is absorbing, but not in ways that one usually finds from the director, and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot
There's things that happen to these people, and Kurosawa's challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole
The character who starts off in the picture, oddly enough (though thankfully as there's not much room for him to grow), is Rokkuchan, a brain damaged man-child who goes around all day making train sounds (the 'clickety-clack' of the title), only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother
But then we branch off: there's the father and son, the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with site-specific descriptions of his dream house; an older man has the look of death to him, and we learn later on he's lost a lot more than he'll tell most people, including a woman who has a past with him; a shy, quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father (or uncle, I'm not sure), who rapes her; and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife- to those who are social around
<br /><br />There are also little markers of people around these characters, like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night, like clockwork, putting big demands on their spouses, sometimes (unintentionally) swapping them! And there's the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman
And of course there's a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum, not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it's about something erotic with a guy
First to note with all of this is how Kurosawa sets the picture; it's a little post-apocalyptic, looking not of any particular time or place (that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets)
It's a marginalized society, but the concerns of these people are, however in tragic scope, meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force
Like Bergman, Kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people, with one scene in particular when the deathly-looking man who has hollow, sorrowful eyes, sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with it
<br /><br />Sometimes there's charm, and even some laughs, to be had with these people
I even enjoyed, maybe ironically, the little moments with Rokkuchan (specifically with Kurosawa's cameo as a painter in the street), or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics
But while Kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise, his camera movements still remain as they've always been- patient but alert, with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots, painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper
Amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories, with some of them (i
the father and son in the car) especially sad, Kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in Eastmancolor like it's one of his paintings
Lush, sprawling, spilling at times over the seams but always with some control, this place is not necessarily "lighter"; it's like the abstract has come full-throttle into the scene, where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath
It's a brilliant, tricky double-edged sword that allows for the dream-like intonations with such heavy duty drama
<br /><br />With a sweet 'movie' score Toru Takemitsu (also responsible for Ran), and some excellent performances from the actors, and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career, Dodes'ka-den is in its own way a minor work from the director, but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms, which as with many Kurosawa dramas like Ikiru and Red Beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality
As a rule, a Full Moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a film
But because I've enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other films, I gave it a shot
The film involves a struggle with a mystic (evil) "brother" who wants to dominate the worlds, and the title character
Mordrid also has to deal with people, and authorities in the mundane world, which he does successfully
Mordrid can travel between "dimensions," and does so to find a companion guarding a fortress; however, the guard has been blinded
So the wizard passes his hands across the other's eyes, and hey, presto! His eyes have been restored! This sort of healing apparently only works with eyes
<br /><br />Later, Mordred and his "brother" animate a couple of animal skeletons in a museum to fight
<br /><br />However, side from that, the picture isn't at all bad, though much like a comic book
Mordred's more "human" adventures are okay, and Combs plays the role convincingly
This is a better than average silent movie and it's still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents
However, if you aren't yet a fan of the genre, I suggest you try a few other films before watching this one
That's because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots
But, despite this, it's still a good film and kept my interest
<br /><br />A nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him
The film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief
Despite this, she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life
However, the rent is due and there's no money, so the lady is forced to look for work
She becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal
Unfortunately, the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party can't make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the man's date
Well, like Cinderella, she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her! What to do now--given that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her?! Well, see the movie yourself to see how it's all resolved
I DIDN'T like how they handled the husband, as it seemed awfully predictable and clichéd
However, once he was out of the way, I do admire how the film also DIDN'T give up a by-the-numbers finale and left the film with a few loose ends
<br /><br />All in all, a very good film worth seeing, but certainly not great
If you are under 13 or above 13 and pretty intoxicated, you'll enjoy D-war
If you are a seriously dedicated fan of all kinds of brainless action films, you'll enjoy D-war
Otherwise, don't bother! I saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends
They really loved it and that made me feel good
After the movie was over, all the kids(my nephews and their friends)could not stop thanking me for taking them to the theater
But, since the half of the audience was kids, they were screaming, shouting and cheering every time the dragons appeared on the screen
This made the viewing experience far more exciting than it should have been
<br /><br />It's a good movie to take your kids to, but except for the final battle sequence, D-War is disappointing
I give this film 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much
If you love The Thin Man series, you will love this movie
Powell's character of Vance is very similar to his character of Nick Charles
<br /><br />The chemistry between Powell and Astor may not be as fabulous as Powell and Loy, but it isn't half bad
I'm on the opposite end of the previous comment
<br /><br />First of all, I don't think this was intended to be a straight sequel to "The Jerk"
it's "The Jerk, Too", which leads me to believe that while a lot of the character names are the same, it actually revolves around a completely different person
<br /><br />Think about it: Virtually no connection to the previous movie, other than character names; a totally different story; different cast; and the fact that it's a partial musical
<br /><br />I say give this movie some credit
i like it where ning climbs down to get his ink, and the skeletons chase him, but luckily he dodged them, opened the window, and didn't even notice them
& when he stuck the needle up ma Wu's butt, its hysterical
and when he is saying love is the greatest thing on earth while standing between two swords is great too
then also the part where he eats his buns while watching thew guy kill many people
then you see him chanting poems as he ran to escape the wolves
the love scenes are romantic, xiao qian and ning look cute together
add the comic timing, the giant tongue, and u have horror, romance, comedy, all at once
not to mention superb special effects for the 90s
Miriam Hopkins is "The Lady with Red Hair" in this 1940 biopic of Mrs
Leslie Carter which also stars Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne, and a fine cast of supporting players, including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory
<br /><br />Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give wonderful performances
Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for Mrs
Rains is great as the flamboyant, egotistical producer/writer/actor/impresario David Belasco, one of the great names in theater
Carter's second husband, Lou Payne, served as adviser on this film, it's a poor representation of the real events of Mrs
True, there was a much publicized and bitter divorce, and she was undoubtedly viewed as a scandalous character for that and for becoming an actress
However, she had custody of her son Dudley, so there was no custody battle
Once she broke with Belasco, she did not go back to him and, in fact, started working in vaudeville and actually made some films toward the end of her life
She did indeed marry Lou, and he became her leading man in many productions
Carter in the beginning of this film is regaining custody of her son, but she finally realizes that in her time away from him, he is thoroughly bonded with his father
In the film also (and I'm not sure if it was true in real life) she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical boarding house, which gives the film some added interesting atmosphere
<br /><br />Not a bad movie, probably not a depiction of the greatness of either Carter or Belasco
Carter's most famous moments was in The Heart of Maryland, where she wore a wig with six-foot tresses
Off-stage, fans blew her hair as she hung 35 feet above the stage clutching the center of a bell to keep it from ringing
Worth watching twice because of the rapid-paced causal shifts among several compelling stories, "Bug" emerges as a wholly satisfying work of art that plays ever-optimistic love against myriad examples of frustrating reality
<br /><br />My favorite characters are Wallace (John Carroll Lynch)whose overriding concern for life--from that of a cockroach to the airline passengers for whom he is partially responsible--frames the film; Olive (Christina Kirk), who spends considerable time creating surreal but tasty meals for her impossible husband Ernie (Chris Bauer); and Mitchell, a cable TV technician with unbounded trust in fortune cookie messages: "You will meet the girl of your dreams
"<br /><br />Against such optimism are the forces of quirky reality, all generated by actions of the characters: parking tickets, a clogged drain in a Chinese food/donut shop, TV disruption, a crushed auto fender, an obliterated dinner reservation that eventually results in cancellation of a Hawaiian vacation
<br /><br />The film is funny: Olive getting drunk at a Chippendale performance, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock)as a customer service rep attempting to deal with an irate customer, the germ-obsessive Cyr (Brian Cox) facing a restaurant inspector, Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) reacting to his girlfriend's refusal to have children by writing hostile Chinese cookie fortunes: "Your girlfriend is lying to you" and the guy who falls asleep while manning a jackhammer because he spent the night looking for his girlfriend's missing cat
<br /><br />A minor story with public cable access host (Darryl Theirse) and a local acting teacher reading from "The Boy in the Bubble" expresses the major theme: love comes from the heart
<br /><br />"Bug" entertains on much the same level as "trains, planes and automobiles" but on a lower budget and with a fresher eye
This movie is pretty cheesy, but I do give it credit for at least trying to provide some characterization for it's principles
There are some great moments in the film and the dialogue has some great moments as well
<br /><br />The aerial assault sequence is perhaps the best part of the movie
<br /><br />I guess I really like the idea of what lengths a veteran will go for a fellow veteran
Sure it's not all that well done, but the premise is not at all bad
'Renaissance (2006)' was created over a period of six years, co-funded by France, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom at a cost of around 14 million
The final result is a staggering accomplishment of comic-book style animation, aesthetically similar to what Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller achieved with 'Sin City (2005),' but this film employed motion capture with live-actors to translate their faces and movements into an entirely animated format
Presented in stark black-and-white, the film looks as though it has been hoisted from the very pages of the graphic novel on which it was based, and the futuristic city of Paris looms ominously above us
Directed by French filmmaker Christian Volckman, in his feature-length debut, 'Renaissance' draws significantly from other films in the science-fiction genre, and the tech-noir storyline isn't something we haven't seen before, but, from a technical standpoint, it is faultless
The city of Paris is a crumbling metropolis filled with dark alleys and deserted footpaths, the recent installation of modern technology merely offering a thin mask to the pitiable degradation of the darkened buildings
The city's largest corporation, Avalon, achieved wealth through offering citizens the promise of beauty and youth, and the company's research department is continually striving to invent greater means of eliminating the aging process
Ilona Tasuiev (voiced by Romola Garai in the English-language version, which I watched) , a brilliant young scientist, is mysteriously kidnapped on her return from work, and so it falls to legendary detective Barthélémy Karas (Daniel Craig) to uncover her current whereabouts
Possibly holding the key to the woman's disappearance is Bislane (Catherine McCormack), Ilona's hardened elder sister, whose trustworthiness is in question, and Jonas Muller (Ian Holm), the dedicated medical doctor who adored Ilona as his own daughter
<br /><br />The eerie, dimly-lit city of Paris is reminiscent of Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner (1982),' and some of the technology looks as though it might have been borrowed from Tom Cruise in 'Minority Report (2002)' {which was, coincidentally, also set in the year 2054}
However, despite this familiarity, Volckman has created an exciting world for his characters to inhabit
Blending classic film-noir and science-fiction, the result is an eye-catching collage of harsh lighting and dark shadows, which, I should warn, occasionally becomes difficult on the viewer's eyes
The dialogue is a little banal at times, and the story, though engaging, doesn't offer anything strikingly original {except for the ending, which I thought was a bold twist on the usual formula}, but 'Renaissance' is intended to work best as a visual treat, and that it succeeds in this regard cannot be denied
This has been one of my favorite movies for a long time
Recently I was happy to see it on DVD which is a relief from watching the old, grainy VHS versions
<br /><br />I hadn't seen it in years and watched it today to find myself amazed at how well the movie stands up to time
It's one of those rare, perfect storms of comedy where great writing (truly funny line after truly funny line) is paired with great direction and outstanding performances all at the same time
<br /><br />Dudley Moore got an Oscar nomination for "Arthur" but lost (although John Gielgud won for best supporting actor)
If Moore's performance in "Arthur" doesn't win a Best Actor Oscar -it's proof that no comedic actor could ever win the title (another example is Gene Wilder in "Young Frankenstein")
<br /><br />Steve Gordon crafts the film beautifully keeping true to each of the characters and the warm-hearted tone of the story
Quite simply, IMHO the movie is a rare gem
It's only sad that Steve Gordon passed away just a year after "Arthur" was released
<br /><br />Regarding the DVD that is available as of 1/2007, it's so/so
Although the video quality is a leap over the old VHS copies, there is still no widescreen version available
<br /><br />The DVD has a few extras that are nice but it's just not enough
One example is commentary from the Director stating how he greatly wished how certain deleted takes and scenes could have been included (because they were hysterical), but that he had to make tough choices for a final edit
The DVD, being the perfect format to include such material, certainly should have offered it as well
<br /><br />This, the original "Arthur", is a classic comedy that is one for the books
Adam Sandler's performance was very inspiring
As he played a very rattled and fragile character, he took his ability to the very edge and really worked the role
I can see myself reading the script for this movie and not being half as interested in the part as Sandler made me
For someone who plays primarily comedy roles, he pulled off a serious role with what seemed to be his own quirks and input
I especially loved the scene in which Adam and Don's characters rode the motorized scooter around the city
I familiarized with the moment, because it seemed like Don was witnessing one thing Adam does to get away from it all
With his video games, music, and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past, riding his scooter with his headphones on seemed like an escape from his thoughts
Although I love this movie, I can barely watch it, it is so real
So, I put it on tonight and hid behind my bank of computers
I remembered it vividly, but just wanted to see if I could find something I hadn't seen before
I didn't: that's because it's so real to me
<br /><br />Another "user" wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary
I'm all for that ! It's absolutely obvious that most of these people who've made comments about "Midnight Cowboy" may not have been born when it was released
They are mentioning other movies Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman have appeared in, at a later time
I'll be just as ruinously frank: I am 82-years-old
If you're familiar with some of my other comments, you'll be aware that I was a professional female-impersonator for 60 of those years, and also have appeared in film - you'd never recognize me, even if you were familiar with my night-club persona
Do you think I know a lot about the characters in this film ? YOU BET I DO !!
If you haven't run-into some of them, it's your loss - but, there's a huge chance you have, but just didn't know it
So many moms, dads, sons and daughters could surprise you
It should be no secret MANY actors/actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of "Midnight Cowboy"
Who is to judge ? I can name several, current BIG-TIME stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities, and weren't the least bit damaged by their time spent there
I make no judgment, because these are humans, just as we all are - love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, humility: you name the attributes, they are all there, no matter what the package looks like
<br /><br />The "trivia" about Hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of "Ratzo" is a gem - he can be seen driving his auto all around Los Angeles - how do you think he gets his input? I can also name lots of male-stars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money
Although the nightclub I last worked in for 26 years was world-famous and legit, I can also name some HUGE stars that had to be constantly chased out our back-street, looking to make a pick-up
<br /><br />This should be no surprise today, although it's definitely action in Hollywood and other cities, large and small
They smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue
<br /><br />Some of the "users" thought "Joe Buck" had been molested by his grandma
Although I saw him in her bed with a boyfriend, I didn't find any incidence of that
Believe-it-or-not, kids haven't ALWAYS had their own rooms - because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going-on in the master-bedroom
Whose business? Hoffman may have begged for change on the streets, but some of the "users" point-out that Jon Voight was not a major star for the filming of "Midnight Cowboy" - his actual salary would surprise you
I think he was robbed ! No one can doubt the clarity he put into his role, nor that it MADE him a star for such great work as "Deliverance"
He defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it: few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie
The end of the 60s may have been one of the first films to be so open, but society has always been hip
<br /><br />I also did not find any homosexuality between "Ratzo" and "Joe" - they were clearly opposites, unappealing to one another
They found a much purely higher relationship - true friendship
If you didn't understand that at the end of the movie, then you've wasted your time
"Joe's" bewilderment, but unashamed devotion was apparent
Yes, Voight deserved an Oscar for this role - one that John Wayne could never pull-off, and he was as handsome in his youth
<br /><br />Hoffman is Hoffman - you expect fireworks
Every character in this film was beautifully defined - if you don't think they are still around, you are mistaken
"The party" ? - attend some of the "raves" younger people attend
Look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs - you'll see every outrageous personality
<br /><br />Brenda Viccaro was the epitome of society's sleek women who have to get down to the nitty-gritty at times
If you were shocked by her brilliant acting, thinking "this isn't real", look at today's "ladies" who live on the brink of disrepute
<br /><br />The brutality "Joe" displayed in robbing the old guy, unfortunately, is also a part of life
You don't have to condone it, but it's not too much different than any violence
"Joe" pointedly named his purpose - in that situation, I'd have handed-over the money quicker than he asked for it
That's one of the scenes that makes this movie a break-through, one which I do not watch
<br /><br />John Schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chillingly beautiful eye-opener- Waldo Salt didn't write from clairvoyance
Anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history, and should be proud for the honesty of it
Perhaps "only in America" can we close our eyes to unpleasant situations, while other movie-makers make no compunction in presenting it to the public
Not looking doesn't mean it isn't there - give me the truth every time
An incredible little English film for so many reasons
First it's a rare look a Laurence Olivier in a light comedy
While his performance is not up the standard he would latter set as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, he is perfectly believable as the hoodwinked barrister
Historically this film is of great interest because of both where and when it was shoot
Being English it didn't have the big budget of the Hollywood films of the same era and it often shows, but more interesting is the fact this movie filmed just prior to the war and shows an England that would soon be gone
When we watch it today we think in terms of modern morality and over look the fact that this movie and its closest American counter part `It Happened One Night' were in their day as risqué as `Fatal Instinct' was in our time
But after watching and enjoying this movie the first time I can't help but feel sadness when I watch it today
With half of film shoot before 1950 gone, saving the remaining films means hard choices, and unfortunately films like this are often passed over to save movies that we all consider important
The color shifting, lack of contrast, and generally poor quality of the print most often seen is heartbreaking
This movie along with `It Happened One Night' are perfect to curl up with a love one under a blanket on cool a cool evening and watch, or better yet why not a double feature
I have been wanting to see cut since the day i have heard of it, which was sometime last year
Anyway i got to see today, and when the movie started i thought that it started rather week but it got better after 10 mins or so
but the thing i didn't like was how the killer was created, i was thinking just before i rented that it would probably suck just like Urban legends: final cut, i almost died it
mostly everything in UL final cut needed to be improved
CUT is 100 times better than UL:final cut
The best part of CUT is the killer and the death scenes
Enjoyed catching this film on very late late late TV and it kept my interest through out the entire picture
This wonderful creepy, yet mysterious looking English home, with evil looking decorations and weired furniture and rooms that make you wonder just why anyone would want to rent this home or even own it
There are four(4)Tales concerning this house, and each resident of the home meets with all kinds of problems
You will notice the beautiful lake and pond around the home and also the sweet singing of birds, but don't let that fool you, there is horror all over the place
Peter Cushing,"Black Jack",'80 gives a great performance as one of the person's living in the home and even Christopher Lee,"Curse of the Crimson Altar",68 and his little daughter, Chloe Franks,(Jane Reid) make a wonderful exciting story together, his daughter for some reason loves to read WITCHCRAFT BOOKS! If you love creepy, horrible and mysterious films, with lots of surprises, this is the FILM FOR YOU!!!
Despite the title, The Sword Bearer, and the DVD cover (action/herioc poses of The Sword Bearer) this is not a super hero film
<br /><br />(Minor Spoilers) It follows the tale of Sasha, The Sword Bearer, who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm
If you had this power as a child could you control it when, say, faced by a mad man, or when your mum's boyfriend is beating her
And if you don't control it, how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12
<br /><br />This essentially is where Sasha is when we meet him
Wandering aimlessly after another killing (much like A Bout de Soufflé)
He then meet Katya, and the pair fall instantly in love, providing Sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways
However, his past is still chasing him, in the form of two police officers
<br /><br />That is essentially the story, and there is virtually no action on screen, though a lot if suggested
Unlike many Hollywood 'super hero' films, we get very little back story, there is no bad guy (unless you count The Sword Bearer himself) abut there is a lot of heart and good character development
<br /><br />Worth checking out if you can find it
This is a low-budget film, which may be off-putting to some, but I have no problem with it
I admire it even more for that, considering it's WAY more entertaining than the drivel that Hollywood churns out every year
Too bad this didn't get a theatrical release; I don't know about anyone else, but I would have went to see it in theatres
`Doctor Mordrid' is a very entertaining science fiction film that just about anyone can enjoy, especially if they're into sci-fi like I am
I don't see why this is a R-rated film; only one f-word is said, and there are no gruesome death scenes, nor is there any blood at all
The timeless rivalry between sorcerers Anton and Kabal (Anton wanted the use his powers to save the human race, while Kabal wanted to enslave them), gave the story a sense of enchantment, while the mythical plotline added charm to the story itself
Basically, this a film that's just plain fun to watch
There is one unintentionally funny thing in this movie, though: seeing Jeffrey Combs keeping a straight face while wearing that silly blue cape and suit
Anyway, the acting is great; the main protagonists (Anton, and his lady friend, Samantha), are very likable; Anton is sympathetic, and hospitable, and Samantha is friendly
The floating island in the other dimension was very cool setting; we're only given a glimpse of it twice, though; it would have been great to see more scenes take place here
The main setting was also very neat; Anton's apartment is very roomy, and he has some cool devices, especially the monitoring system he uses to keep track of the world's occurrences
He even has a pet raven that he keeps in his apartment named Edgar
Overall, this a great film; it was fun to watch, and the main actors put a lot of feeling into their roles
If you can find anywhere that rents `Doctor Mordrid', you should rent it (or, in my case, buy it
It was definitely money well-spent)!<br /><br />My Rating: 8 stars out of ten
I settled back to watch "Read My Lips," a plate of Freedom Fries before me
The food was quickly forgotten as I became engrossed by director and co-writer Jacques Audiard's original and superb thriller
<br /><br />Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is a secretary at a firm that develops major building projects
She actually has some significant responsibilities that don't often fall to secretaries and she's capable and ambitious
And thwarted by a male hierarchy that will exploit but not reward her
<br /><br />Work piling up faster than she can handle it, Carla is told to hire a secretary
Enter ex-con and general layabout Paul (Vincent Cassel)
He lies about his skills and in fact has none that any legitimate enterprise might require
After an initial serious misunderstanding by Paul as to Carla's interest in him, the two become allies
In a stunt that would have made a real Carla a major contender on "The Apprentice," she trumps her egotistic male adversary at work with Paul's connivance
<br /><br />Carla is virtually deaf without her hearing aid
She turns the hearing aid off to isolate herself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people
A heroic makeup effort was made to have her appear plain but she's truly beautiful
She babysits so a friend can have a liaison (it IS a French movie) Worse and humiliatingly, she accedes to a girlfriend's plea that she hang out somewhere while that married friend has it off with her paramour in Carla's bed
<br /><br />As Carla and Paul get to know each other better, the barely repressed larcenous side of the not so former felon emerges
There's a side story, by the way, of Paul's relationship with his parole officer which neatly complements the main plot and has its own big surprise ending
<br /><br />"Read My Lips?" Ingenious Paul recognizes that Carla's ability to read lips, even from a considerable distance, is more than the amusing parlor trick it first seems to be
<br /><br />Paul and Carla are a true criminal oddball couple
She wants love but will also accept money
He wants her, sort of, but business must come before possible erotic satiation
Together Cassel and Devos are strong actors carrying an unusual crime tale to its end very convincingly
<br /><br />Rent it or buy it but if you enjoy a good crime story you'll go for "Read My Lips
" And you may well want to watch it several times: I do
I was so glad I came across this short film
I'm always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across, so when I saw this and saw that it was nominated for the Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards, I was so pleased that I actually had a film that I was rooting for
<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple, the director, writer, and star Nacho Vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals
The result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy
<br /><br />It's a well made short film, well edited and the actors all do a great job
I borrowed (slightly modified) title from some other comment
I have to say, that as i usually don't like relationship series, I really did liked this one
Great characters, interesting and not cliché story, good acting, good and again not cliché (which in case of dialogs is rather rare) dialogs
It is really interesting, how the characters cross paths with each other, and sometimes knowingly, sometimes more or less at random influence each others lives
But unfortunately, as we say in our country - do you know how do you recognize a good US series? It is the one that got canceled before the end of the first season
When originally screened in America in 1972, 'The Night Stalker' became the highest rated made-for-T
Based on Jeff Rice's unpublished novel, it told how a fearless investigative reporter named Carl Kolchak ( the late Darren McGavin ) discovered the existence of a vampire in modern-day Las Vegas
When it arrived on British television four years later, it did not quite have the same impact, but my friends were talking about it at school on Monday morning, as indeed was I
We all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen
<br /><br />I did not know of the existence of 'The Night Strangler' until it turned up nearly a decade later
, who screened the 'Kolchak' movies, had apparently decided to pass on the spin-off series; they felt 'Barnaby Jones' starring Buddy Ebsen to be more of a draw, and anyway, viewers might confuse 'Kolchak' with 'Kojak'! For years my only source of information concerning the show was an article in Fangoria magazine
I could not even purchase the Jeff Rice novels
<br /><br />Then something wonderful happened
-2 put out the show as part of a late-night Friday series devoted to the supernatural called 'Mystery Train', hosted by Richard O'Brian
'Kolchak' found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of 'The Brain Eaters' and 'Earth Vs
The opening titles were trimmed, removing Kolchak's whistling, and the closing credits
<br /><br />The first episode screened was 'Werewolf'
I cannot say I was overly impressed, but stuck with it, and am I glad that I did!<br /><br />I really wish I'd seen it in 1974
My twelve year old self would have adored it
Creepy, humorous, exciting, no wonder it fired Chris Carter's imagination
<br /><br />The show's biggest asset was, of course, McGavin
Unlike the recent Kolchak, the original was an everyman figure, eccentrically dressed, rather conservative
He was to the supernatural what 'Columbo' was to crime
The late Simon Oakland was great too as Kolchak's bad-tempered boss Tony Vincenzo
The scripts overflowed with wonderful, dry wit
I found myself enjoying the programme more for the humour content than the horror
When the twenty episodes ended, I felt bereft
<br /><br />'The X-Files' came along a few years later and filled the void - but only to an extent
I am glad that the show was never revived though
Without Oakland it would not have been the same
<br /><br />I have the Rice books now and have read them several times
I was very surprised when Stephen King slated the first ( in his book 'Danse Macabre' ) as it is as good as anything he has written
<br /><br />Alright, so some of the monsters were hardly state-of-the-art, but so what? The new 'Kolchak' totally missed the point of the original
What you don't see is sometimes more frightening than what you do
<br /><br />Best Episode - 'Horror In The Heights' Worst Episode - 'The Sentry
This may be the only film that actually comes close to capturing on film the essentially uncapturable world of the American college experience of the late 60s-early 70s
Go ahead, name another movie that even approaches this one: "Getting Straight"? "RPM"? These are caricatures
"Return of the Secaucus Seven" has its moments, but that's a retrospective film about (self-obsessed) individuals more than a film about a time and a place depicted *in* that time and place
"Drive, He Said" portrays-- with subtlety and nuance where it should, and a swift kick in the shorts where that's the only appropriate way-- the anti-draft movement, the ambiguity of big-time college sports (especially when there's a war on), the sexual revolution of the period, and the general unreality of the day
<br /><br />The whole cast deserves commendation (as does the director, of course) but particular praise should be reserved for Bruce Dern, as the basketball coach, and Karen Black, the hero's very unusual-- except for that time-- love interest
William Tepper, as the lead, also rates a real round of applause both for his perfect capturing of the student-athlete of the period and for actually playing real college basketball in the film (remember Anthony Perkins in "Tall Story"? Yikes!)
<br /><br />All in all, a classic of a kind-- and the last film someone currently in 6th grade should be writing comments on ("boring", "repellent"-- um, right, sonny, please go back to your Arnold movies)
This film is definitely an odd love story
Though this film may not be much to shout about, Nicole Kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten, though Ben Chaplin does do quite a good job of Hertfordshire Life with shots of St Albans & Hemel Hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area
What starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular British TV series"Heartbeat" soon turns into a gritty gangster getaway action flick
Nothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus ends-up as fairly decent weekend entertainment
A good one to watch, and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character
To those who have not followed the Anne Marie Fahey Murder case
You are missing out one of the saddest yet complicated murder of all
The murderer is popular Delaware attorney, Tom Capano and the victim is the Delaware Governor's Scheduling Secretary, Anne Marie Fahey
Their relationship was a well-kept secret until her disappearance and murder
She wanted to leave him but he just wouldn't let her go so easily
On the other hand, he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters
Where did he find the time to have two mistresses and a domestic family life? Besides, the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a four hour mini series
Fahey does a fine job, she does not have her dark long hair
His other mistress is definitely more attractive than the actual woman
Mark Harmon is better looking and does an Emmy award winning performance as Tom Capano
It would be better with actual Delaware and Philadelphia locations
With Ann Rule's executive producing, she adds accuracy to Anne Marie's characteristic of organization and her personal battle with an eating disorder
These bits of information might be overlooked by any other executive producer or director
If you have not read the book, it is well worth it
Ann Rule is a fascinating storyteller of true crime
It is ironic that Mark Harmon plays Tom Capano
He also played Ann Rule's former friend and subject, Ted Bundy in an another book adaptation many years ago
He does an above average job with an amazing story
Even President CLinton offered his assistance in the Anne Marie Fahey case
And now, the former Governor Tom Carper is now the United States Senator for Delaware who defeated longtime, popular incumbent Senator Richard Roth in the November 2000 election
IF you don't think the movie is interesting, then the read Rule's book
My expectations were quite high for this film
Everyone I know who saw this film at the cinema told me that everyone there stayed through the credits because they were so touched
My expectations could not have been any higher, anything short of wonderful would have disappointed me
<br /><br />I was anything but disappointed by this movie
I loved how it dealt with difficult subjects without going through the usual steps a Hollywood film tends to include
In this film characters worked through problems they had had for decades, they worked through prejudicm, they learned to open up
But it did not come easily, and not just by singing a song or two
It was painful, it took arguments, it took confrontations
<br /><br />One scene that really stuck out to me was the scene in which Gabriella sings her song
Helen Sjöholm is one of my favorite singers, her voice is lovely, and you could tell that she was not just lip-syncing to a previous recording during filming (which I often find in other movies), she really sang with her whole body and soul
You could feel what Gabriella was feeling in that scene
Had this movie been made in Hollywood her song would most likely have been sung toward the end, and it would have made her husband open his eyes and see the error of his ways, as well as making the other people in the village realise a thing or two
Instead it came halfway through, and it did not bring any solutions
Her husband did not become overwhelmed and realise what he's putting her through, and it didn't seem to make anyone else in the village more open minded
It was beautiful, it was pure and it was touching but it did not magically solve all her problems
That felt real to me, that's probably what would have happened in real life
The whole movie felt like real life to me, nothing neatly wrapped up but everything with a sense of joy and happiness
You rarely find a movie which feels so realistic
<br /><br />There were a few things that bothered me, but hey, no movie is perfect
If you haven't already you should go see "As it is in Heaven" and be filled with a joy for life, a sense of hope and the feeling that you've been touched on a level movies rarely reach
You will be sad, pained, happy and a dozen other emotions
<br /><br />Someone once said that if every person in the world sang in a choir there would be no more wars
Having seen this film I might have to agree
An unassuming, subtle and lean film, "The Man in the White Suit" is yet another breath of fresh air in filmic format from Ealing studios
While I suspect some modern viewers may initially find it obscure, I doubt many would fail to be charmed by the expert way the plot, the themes and characters are languidly relayed during the film's course
<br /><br />The genuinely great Alec Guinness gives another fine characterization in a film perhaps not as obviously virtuoso as Ealing's inspired "Kind Hearts and Coronets" from 1949
This time, he merely plays one character rather than eight, but as the unworldly inventor and scientist Sidney Stratton, he always finds the correct tone and expression
Along with Guinness' subtle, expressive performance, the rest of the cast are effective
Of the main players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger do stand out
Thesiger is compellingly absurd as the crippled but influential business grandee, while Parker is dependable as the ineffectual yet pivotal mill owner and father
Father, that is, of Joan Greenwood, the deftly delectable comic actress, who is at her insurmountable peak in this film
Resplendent and seductive of aspect and diction, she is quite sublime in this film, a fine contrast with the similarly unusual, but more maladroit Guinness
The scene where she seemingly tries to tempt him is played so adeptly by the pair that it is both deeply poignant and amusing
<br /><br />The themes are handled very effectively, with no easy morals drawn
The complexities of the relationships between science, business and the workforce are insightfully and enjoyably examined
Expertly helmed by Alexander Mackendrick, this film is technically adept in all areas; evocative photography, fitting sound effects and music and a wistful script, all quietly impress
A thoroughly satisfying film, with Guinness and Greenwood magnificent
People don't seem to be giving Lensman enough credit where its due
A few issues have been overlooked which are key to understanding the Lensman experience
<br /><br />The Year: For the year it was made in (1984) Lensman features some of the most stunning effects I've ever seen
As a person who watches a lot of early 80's animation Lensman is unique in it's use of what appears to be computer-generated imagery at a time when computers were extremely primitive
Kim's battle against the geometric cutter pods in the laser maze can be taken as an excellent example of this
Every time I watch that I have to keep repeating to myself that it was 1984 when it was made
<br /><br />The Soundtrack: Lensman has one of the most insane soundtracks that I've heard, and this mad hysterical beat permeates every corner of the film
Lensman borrowed heavily on two western mistakes and managed to somewhat deal with the first one - the need to fill in every second of silence in a film with music and the need for a heroine
While the music is attuned well and galvanizes scenes such as the motorcycle battle in the Thionite Factory on Radelyx, the heroine theme fails due to the sheer annoyance value of Chris
It's interesting to note that the constant music thwarted my attempts at noise removal when I was archiving lensman over from analog tape to digital format - since there wasn't a single second of silence available to use as a reference point
<br /><br />Western Influences: Helmut - sounds like "helmet" and has roughly the same voice as Darth Vader
Clarissa Fairborn - has the same hairstyle as the princess of SW and her name sounds suspiciously similar to Marissa Fairborn of Transformers
Takes over Han Solos role by flying the ship and having some technical expertise
Buzzkirk - a definite improvement on Chewbaka
The lens - a nice concrete copy of the force that comes across less as a chance to preach Christianity at the audience than in the original SW
While the force relied on belief far more than concentration, the lens is a pure concentration tool
Theoretically, anyone could wield the lens
The lens is far more limited than the Force - being purely a defensive/offensive weapon
<br /><br />Technology: The boskone alliance have interesting meatball sponge ships
They look like stormtroopers only with red uniforms instead of white
The idea of a DNA weapon was nice if only it had been developed
The Galactic Alliance looked like Starblazers (or whatever it was called - that 60's series where they were battling the Xylons)
There weren't enough ship to ship battles for me - this is much improved upon in the second Lensman film
This character is a unique and very interesting character-design who fortunately continues on to the second film
THE ODD COUPLE (3+ outta 5 stars)<br /><br />Like most people I will always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the definitive "Odd Couple"
Their incredible work on the TV series from the early to mid-70s was a highwater mark for television at the time
easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale
Nonetheless, how can you go wrong with a Jack Lemmon/Walter Matthau pairing? Matthau is in especially good form as Oscar, the slob
Lemmon takes a bit of getting used to as Felix, particularly if you have previously seen Tony Randall's outstanding performance
(I will go on record here as stating that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst, most over-rated playwrights of American theatre
) The storyline is simple: Felix, a neat freak and newly separated from his wife moves in with Oscar, the slob who needs some help saving money for alimony payments
Their living arrangement becomes much like a marriage as well, culminating in some amusing tiffs and spats
Beautiful story of Wisconsin native, Dan Jansen, and his real life, agonizing struggle to win the 1994 Olympic Gold Medal in Speed Skating, despite his overwhelming emotional loss with the death of his much loved Best Friend and Family Member; his Sister, Jane
<br /><br />This story's main focus is to sensitively portray the real life emotional turmoil of grief, that one feels in loosing a special Loved One, and the struggle to productively cope and rise above the great loss! It is the incredible story of Dan Jansen's heartbreak in loosing his beloved Sister to Leukemia, his struggle to cope with the intensity of his grief, while still maintaining his Dream to win at the Olympics, and his ultimate triumph in winning the Gold Medal in Speed Skating for America, and in honor of his Sister's memory; thereby fulfilling his childhood promise to Jane!<br /><br />After Dan Jansen's remarkable Gold Medal performance in the Winter Olympic in Lillihamer, Norway, he established a Foundation in 1994 to help fight Leukemia, which claimed the life of his Sister, and to support youth sports programs, educational and scholarship awards
His Dan Jansen Foundation promotes the philosophy that: "as his Father always told him at a young age: 'there is more to life than skating around in circles!' Maintaining a proper perspective is key! So, too, is setting goals, and realizing one's Dreams through perseverence, overcoming adversity and never giving up!"<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who has ever suffered the great loss of someone very special, and dearly loved within your life! And, for anyone who still believes in the Achievement of Dreams, and Never Giving Up
And I'll tell you why: whoever decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for television was very ill-advised
EVERYTHING CONCERNING DRUGS IS CUT OUT AND COVERED UP!!! How do they do it, you might ask? Well, they don't do it very well, that's for sure
Anyway, instead of the marijuana which Cheech and Chong are supposed to have in their possession, they are said to have diamonds! Still, the characters go around in a haze of marijuana smoke stoning others along their way with no explanation whatsoever
The directing behind this film was fantastic for a comedy
Many of the scenes appear to be out of a comic book and much darker (visually -- not story wise) than what I expected
Granted, this may not be the funniest movie ever made, especially if you are into very crude sexist jokes as this has very little of that (compared to others like Something About Mary or American Pie)
As you rewatch it, several jokes stand out and get funnier
If you have ever read a comic book or watched a comic book-type movie (Batman, X-Men, etc
) and liked them, you will probably enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the movie
If you didn't like them, you may like the respectful ridicule that this film has for those
If you did like this movie, the dvd has some cool extras
Its main character Julian, played with an unusual mix of charm and unbalance by Brosnan, is not your typical hero
Julian is a hit man who is experiencing a late mid-life crises
Having spent 22 years in the profession of cold blooded murder he now finds himself stressed out and desperately lonely
And so, after a chance meeting at a bar with Danny (Greg Kinnear), he latches on and begins a halting, awkward friendship
Danny, the quintessential nice guy, is dealing with some stuff in his own life and, truth be told, could use a friend as well
The two make an unexpected connection, and Danny sticks around to hear Julian's story, even after learning the "unsavory" truth about Julian's work
<br /><br />Matador approaches a subject not completely unheard of in cinema, the anti-hero assassin (films like 'Assassins' and 'Grosse Pointe Blank' come to mind)
First of all, the killing and gore is implied but never really shown in any detail, meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you
And second, unlike most anti-hero films, Matador makes no attempt to show remorse and redemption from its main character
Julian's job is simply presented as an 'it is what it is' kind of thing
99% of us would consider killing for money horrific
And yet this unorthodox approach is perhaps what makes the film feel authentic
Although we don't like to admit it, almost anything could become mundane after we did it long enough, maybe even murder
Did Julian's victims deserve to die? Who is paying to have people killed? Who knows
The movie never deals with these questions
The focus is on Julian and his stumbling shuffle into a genuine friendship
If you read about someone like Julian in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer, but forced to watch his life you are drawn in by his intense humanity
<br /><br />Brosnan's take on Julian is well done and deeply unsettling
He doesn't completely divorce himself from his James Bond good looks and smooth charm, but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix
Weird or crude remarks in the middle polite conversations and sudden shifts from suave charm to childish tantrums and sad desperate pleas for acceptance
It keeps you guessing about his grasp on his sanity and how it will affect those around him
It's a bit like listening to a piano player that occasionally and unexpectedly hits a wrong note while he plays, but it works
The films only other major role, that of Danny, is not nearly as meaty
Kinnear turns in a solid if unspectacular performance as a regular Joe with a regular Joe life and problems
<br /><br />The film doesn't really have any huge shocks or M Night Shyamalan twists, but I wasn't able to guess the ending and it felt satisfying
It doesn't have any deep philosophical or spiritual insights and yet it felt very human
And it didn't have any heart pounding car chases or gun battles and yet I thought the pacing was well done and I was never bored
Maybe the only real message here is about the human need to reach out and make connections with one another, and how those needs have no moral prerequisites
Even a murderer needs friends, and even good people can be friends with bad people
It's a comment on the strange, random world we live in
The makers have chosen the best people for the job, and set the scene wonderfully
Every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it
Whether the period is the 20s (the first story), the present (ie 1950) for the middle story, or the 1910s (the last), costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created
I love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium - exquisite lace overlaid by the finest Shetland shawls
Roland Culver as Ashenden is very appealing, but never mind the soppy young lovers, it's Raymond Huntley as the man who resents his wife's health and independence who harrows our emotions
He usually played comical, pompous types, but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive
The China Seas (great 30s film starring Gable and Harlow) stole the plot from the Mr Know All episode (and also nicked a story by Kipling)
I wish we saw more of Naunton Wayne as the jealous husband - though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a Mexican hat
I love that posh bird who plays his wife, too
"May Contain Spoilers*<br /><br />"All Dogs Go to Heaven" is a great movie
I saw it in 1989 when I was two years old
I didn't understand it that well but as I saw it more and more times I started to love it
My favorite songs are "Let Me Be Surprised" and "Soon You'll Come Home"
The only thing that bothers me about the movie is Charlie dieing
When I was little my sister couldn't even watch that part
<br /><br />My favorite part of the movie is when Annabelle and Charlie are flying around heaven
Heaven is beautiful in the movie and the "clocks" are very clever
I also love Itchy, in fact I have 3 dachshunds of my own
<br /><br />Overall I love this movie and suggest everyone should see it
I've really enjoyed this adaptation of "Emma"
I have seen it many times and am always looking forward to seeing it again
Though it only lasts 107 minutes, most of the novel plot and sub-plots were developed in a satisfactory way
Most of the dialogues come directly from the novel with no silly jokes added as in Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility
<br /><br />As a foreigner, I particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actors
I find this version quite on a par with the 1995 miniseries "Pride and Prejudice" but then the producer and screenwriter were the same
Kate Beckinsale did a really good job portraying "Emma" of whom Jane Austen said she would create a heroin no-one but her would love
She is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be still likable
Mark Strong was also very good at portraying Mr Knightley, not an easy part, I think, though he has not the charisma shown by Colin Firth's Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice
Even the end scene (the harvest festival) which does not happen in the novel provides a fitting end except for when it shows Emma being cold and almost unpleasant with Frank Churchill whereas in the novel she was thoroughly reconciled with him, even telling him that she would have enjoyed the duplicity, had she been in his situation
A strange departure from the faithfulness otherwise shown throughout the film
I find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptations from Jane Austen's novels
Halloween is one of those movies that gets you skin deep! It is in my opinion, the scariest movie of all time
Michael Myers is the best boogeyman ever! He was just so terrifying! What makes Halloween so special is that there was no special effects where you can tell how computer animated it is, this was on a low budget and had a one note score, yet managed to scare the Hell out of people
25 years and this movie still has the same effect as it did in '78
<br /><br />It's about a boy Michael Myers, he kills his sister at the age of 6 and so many years later escapes the mental institution
Sam Loomis is after him and will do anything to get him back, since he describes Michael as "
Michael is on a mission though, to kill his other sister, Laurie, played by a new Jamie Lee Curtis
She has to babysit on Halloween, while her friends are out partying and of course, we know the rules, they get it! But Laurie may stand a chance since she's the virgin
;D <br /><br />Halloween pays many homages to Psycho, we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, the daughter of Janet Leigh
Halloween is an absolute terrific movie that breaks boundaries and makes you lock the doors, bolt your windows, and turn off the lights! "They're gonna get you! They're gonna get you!"
Halloween, the ultimate horror film! <br /><br />10/1
I first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it
It's beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time
It's difficult to believe this was made in 1946, as the tale is still fresh today, and really makes one think
I'm not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made
In addition, the acting is superb, and the use of English and American actors quite astounding
I recently purchased the DVD so now I'm able to watch whenever I wish
I highly recommend anyone interested in post-war British films to watch this
<br /><br />Filmed just after the war, this story was made in order to highlight Anglo-American relations after the war
It ended up receiving the honour of being the first Royal Premiere after WWII
<br /><br />Remarkably the film tangles together the Royal Air Force, Sigmund Freud Psychology, the Founding fathers of America and various others up the long stairs (special effects in its infancy) and beyond the heavenly gates without losing any of its integrity
<br /><br />Although sounding absurd, this clever script leads and dances the viewer between heaven and earth with the skill of a mountain goat and a presents a charming ease rarely matched in cinema since
<br /><br />Be prepared to have your heart warmed by this sweet, innocent and charming love story
Roger Livesey acts like a man possessed to steal the show!!!! <br /><br />British Cinema should cry when it remembers how good it used to be in those early post war years
If you enjoy the subtle (yes, I said subtle) actions and reactions of John Candy, you can't help but like this film (pronounced "fillum" by Salvatore DiPasquale)
The unobservant (and uninformed) watcher always saw Candy as a broad actor - a big buffoon
And sometimes he was (see "Stripes" and "Splash")
But, when given the opportunity, he could really be razor-sharp and quite subtle
It's too bad he was cast in so many roles that only showed his broad side, because we'll never get to see more of the other
One can watch "Going Berserk" over and over (I know I have) with the frequency of "Caddyshack
The plot, although a little convoluted, is actually fairly deep for a farce of this kind
It allows Candy and the always under-rated Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to bounce off of Candy
Definitely worth a glance for anyone who enjoyed SCTV or Candy's other work
I've also been looking to find this movie for quite some time, and how great it would be to find it on DVD
<br /><br />I saw this movie when I was about 6 years old, in the Netherlands
It was shown before Walt Disney's JUNGLE BOOK! <br /><br />What I remember of this movie is fragmented
I remember that an Indian boy was friends with an eagle
For some reason he was thrown out of his village (did not grasp the reason for this)
When other boys threw stones at him, he climbed a rock and jumped off
At that time he turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend
As an eagle he was still wearing his turquoise necklace
This is an excellent film about a traditional working class family in Northern England
Filmed on location in Bolton, it stars James Mason as the father who is the dominant force within his home
Cleverly, the film, based on the play, portrays the complexities of family life
The supporting cast is terrific as well, with many familiar faces lending support
Set in Japan, Ashura is the story of Demons taking over the earth
The premise is far more complicated, but the arching storyline should not be forgotten
Japan is in turmoil, with Demons occupying human form roaming the lands
Generally speaking Demons look and act like humans, but are evil
The Japanese word they use is not just demons, but rather the classical form of 'ogre' which is a mythological creature of some historic stature
We're talking about creatures that would appear more like gods than simple ugly child-eating monsters
<br /><br />However in human form all that remains is the green eyes and green teeth, which appear when put under any sort of stress
In order to save the world from Demons there are Demon-slayers
Trained and skilled warriors who can spot and defeat most every kind of demon, and who guard the passage-way between the realm of hell and that of the real world
<br /><br />The story begins with a festival in a local town
Amid these festivities, 3 men ride in, dressed in all black, seemingly intent on doing harm
The villagers run, excepting those which are demonic in nature, who turn green-eyed and try to kill them
The Demon-Slayers end up killing off the majority of the demons
The whole essence of the story begins when at the gate to hell a fortune-telling demon appears before the 3 gate-keepers, revealing the arrival of Ashura
With it, comes the end of the reign of man, and begins the reign of demons
Ashura however requires some form of birthing process, the first step of which occurred during the opening battle, but which won't be revealed to you until you see the film
The 3 demon-slayers are a wise old man, a powerful yet unprincipled man, and a skilled and compassionate warrior
Immediately you can see the split between them, the old man wanting to stop the demons, the powerful one wanting to bend them to his increasing ego maniacal wishes and the third looking to stop the second
Along the way he meets a woman who he begins to take fancy to, and believes himself to have a special relationship with
She in turn is a brigand who is good-natured, sought after by authorities
When the two finally meet face to face, he places his hand on her shoulder, and suddenly she is scathed by a mark on her shoulder
Needless to say, the mark is not a good sign
What ensues is a battle for earth, a battle between both good and evil, as it should be, but also between good and good itself
<br /><br />The point for me of this film became something other than what I thought it would
I came in thinking it would either be a fast-paced action style film with demons, or a horror film with macabre evil and foul creatures the likes of which would be seen in Ringu and Ju-on
I was however mistaken in the best possible way
The story it seemed to me is an adaptation of a very old Japanese play, and it plays itself out as such, combining the essentially action driven adrenaline scenes with a great concept, an amazing narrative, and a style which makes you compelled to think rather than just sit wallowing in gore
Many scenes are painted with luxurious dialogue between two characters the likes of which will never be seen in a Hollywood film
It becomes a practically theatrical experience which takes your breath away
<br /><br />The film makes use of some immaculate scenery and camera-work comparable to many great Samurai films of our days, but adding to it a well-thought and classical plot
With great acting, great music, and thoroughly stunning scenes, its a must watch in my book
<br /><br />That being said, it does need the disclaimer that it is not for everyone
Its not cheap thrills horror, its not balls to the wall action
Its a horror style play thats been filmed
It has very much to say and takes the time to do so, flying in the face of the conventional one-liners
Like Japanese plays, the exchanges between the characters can last for many minutes before they come together for a quick yet marvelous battle scene
If you can enjoy such a thing, this is a masterpiece
If your idea of a good film is slasher flicks with little plot and excessive nudity, then you can easily watch something else
<br /><br />Overall, this film to me is a unique and amazing one, which keeps you riveted and amused
it has good writing, good acting, and good direction
To be fair, I expected car chases in this film
There was only really one, but apart from that, 'Freeway' was a great movie which I am glad to own on DVD
The only really big names in the cast are HOMICIDE's Richard Belzer as the radio psychiatrist and B-Movie villain par-excellance Billy Drago as the Revelation-quoting Freeway Killer
But the rest of the cast generally give good performances
I especially liked how Darlanne Fluegel gave her character, Sunny, a bit of guts
She could have been a helpless victim character but she is fully rounded as she seeks out Drago with the help of bounty hunter James Russo
<br /><br />Russo, I'm afraid, comes across as rather wooden, but then again, the character he plays, Frank, isn't very well fleshed out save for a back story Sunny is given by his former commanding officer
The tone of menace is kept up superbly throughout the film and the atmosphere of the lonely LA freeway at night with the killer prowling its' length in his sinister grey sedan is an excellent way of building tension, and the music used to underscore the film is suitably composed
I don't know why there are some people who hate this movie so
Different strokes for different folks, I suppose
But I absolutely enjoyed 'Freeway' and I can strongly recommend it
I am Curious (Yellow) (a film, in near Seussical rhyme, is said right at the start to be available in two versions, Yellow and Blue) was one of those big art-house hits that first was a major sensation in Sweden then a big scandal/cause-celebre in the United States when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the Supreme Court
What's potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of what's revealed in the sex or nudity- the director/"actor" Vilgot Sjoman films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and genitalia and the occasional graphic bit but it's always more-so an intellectual expression than very lust-like- but the daring of the attempt at a pure 'metafilm' while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in Sweden
Who knew such things in a generally peaceful country (i
usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars) could be so heated-up politically? At least, that's part of Sjoman's aim here
<br /><br />Like a filmmaker such as Dusan Makavajev with some of his works like W
(if not as surreal and deranged) or to a slightly lesser extent Bertolucci, Sjoman is out to mix politics and sex (mostly politics and social strata) around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film
The two characters, Lena and Borje, have a hot-cold relationship in the story of the film, where Lena is a "curious" socialist-wannabe who demonstrates in the street for nonviolence and 'trains' sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully functioning one, while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend
And as this is going on, which is by itself enough for one movie, Sjoman inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film (there's even a great bit midway through where, as if at a rock concert, title cards fill in during a break in shooting who the crew are, negating having to use end credits!) Then with this there's a whole other dynamic as Sjoman gives an actual performance, not just a "hey, I'm the director playing the director" bit
<br /><br />At first, one might not get this structure and that I am Curious (Yellow) is just a film where Lena is a documentary interviewer asking subjects about their thoughts on class, socialism, Spain and Franco, and once in a while we see Lena's father or Bjore
But Sjoman does something interesting: the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes; it's impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative, documentary, film-within-a-film, and even a serious interview with Martin Luther King, who also acts as a quasi-guru for Lena
It might not always be completely coherent analysis politically, but it doesn't feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a Godard picture; the satire Sjoman is after is akin to a Godard but on a whole other wavelength
His anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewer
<br /><br />If I Am Curious (Yellow) stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a full-blown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors, it isn't entirely successful, I think, as an emotional experience
Where Bergman had it down to a T with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies, Sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors
Occasionally it works if only for the actors, Lena Nyman (mostly spectacular here in a performance that asks of her to make an ambitious but confused kid into someone sympathetic and vulnerable even) and Borje Ahlstedt (a great realistic counterpoint to the volatile Lena), but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the inner-film of Lena and Borje since (perhaps intentionally) Sjoman fills it up with clichés (Borje has a girlfriend and kid, will he leave her, how will Lena reconcile her father) and a heavy-handed narration from his starlet of sorts
<br /><br />And yet, for whatever faults Sjoman may have, ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself, I Am Curious (Yellow) holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in Swedish cinema, or testing what couldn't be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage
I'd even go as far as to say it's influential, and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time (a specific technique used, with the film rewinding towards the end, is echoed in poorer usage in Funny Games), and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avant-garde or meta-film-making
If it's not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as W
I bought the DVD of Before Sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago
Having saw it twice, I couldn't help but missing Before Sunrise, not because the sequel was not as great, but I felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did, every time I finished watching one of them, I feel the need and yearning to see the other
So, I ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly, I will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly
The most remarkable thing about Before Sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other
It sounds so simple, the growing of the chemistry, I think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development, but to me - who doesn't believe in Nora Ephron - Before Sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it
When I saw it for the first time, about 8 year ago when I was 20, I already liked it
But, I didn't rate it as a "great film", it still seemed to me like another thinking persons' feel good movie, Linklater was too smart to make it more realistic, it was 10 minutes too long, the characters was too well fabricated, I thought I liked it because it was like a dream and because I enjoyed their conversations, etc
But now, thanks to Before Sunset, I feel that's more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before
I saw the elements more clearly: Jesse, Celine, Vienna, their conversations, everything
How each of them are separated element by itself, and they have a chance to mix, the story is just a frame of time, I am no longer feel manipulated
And the freedom that every scene has, as well as its refusal to be overly efficient, how blind I was that those qualities didn't strike me as exceptional when I first saw it! Now, 8 year have passed, the more movies I've seen, the more I realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending, even movies like Pulp Fiction or Linklaters's own Slackers included
The Jesse and Celine tale avoid that, maybe Before Sunset is a better example in this case, but Before Sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time, not a destination, every single scene has its own life
I don't know whether Linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made Before Sunrise, but to me, one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other
Before Sunrise which I think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes, seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding Jesse and Celine, the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it
Meanwhile, I enter the vision of boredom as Jesse stuck talking to the journalists in Before Sunset, and Celine's first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile I've seen in a beginning of a film, and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place I don't know with a sadness in me, no matter how beautiful Paris is, and no matter how happy I am that they meet again
I'm sorry that I go on this long with my limited English, Before Sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts, and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it
As the celebration of Christmas has evolved through the years, whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions, it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other
That has somehow slipped past one Ebenezer Scrooge, merchant and money lender in 19th century London
<br /><br />As his nephew points out to his uncle, he doesn't keep Christmas in any way because Scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug
The humanity in Scrooge was driven out long ago, he's a hard case, a whole lot like his 20th Century counterpart, Mr
<br /><br />But as Charles Dickens told this tale, redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit Scrooge and show him how
<br /><br />A Christmas Carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century Great Britain as Oliver Twist was
The characters in this film are middle and lower class
The Cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in Oliver Twist, but they are having to struggle to stay up there
Still love and happiness radiate their home, no thanks to the guy Bob Cratchit works for
<br /><br />Like George Bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much, Ebenezer Scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old world
<br /><br />Patrick Stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of Scrooge
Scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film
The meanness of him, but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change
Scott joins a fine tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim who've both done great interpretations of Scrooge
<br /><br />Among the supporting roles I particularly enjoyed David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of Christmas present
<br /><br />According to IMDb this is one of 32 versions of A Christmas Carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best
I would never have thought I would almost cry viewing one minute excerpted from a 1920 black and white movie without sound
Thanks to Martin Scorsese I did (the movie was from F
You will start to understand (if it's not already the case), what makes a good movie
Unlike like some of the pumped up, steroid trash that is passed off as action movies, Playing God is simple and realistic, with characters that are believable, action that is not over the top and enough twists and turns to keep you interested until the end
<br /><br />Well directed, well acted and a good story
I have to admit that I went into Fever Pitch with low expectations
It's no huge revelation for me to say that Jimmy Fallon's last movie (Taxi) was Catwomanly bad, and the trailers for Fever Pitch were all right but didn't mesmerize me
I was already preparing some cheesy baseball puns for my review
<br /><br />"I like Jimmy Fallon, but Taxi was strike one in his movie career
Well, now we've got steeeeee-riiiiiike twoooooooo! One more strike, and it's back to SNL!" or "Buy yourself some peanuts and cracker jacks, but don't buy tickets to Fever Pitch
You'll walk out of the theater and never go back!" Then the movie had to go and be way more entertaining than I was expecting
But hey, I couldn't let my puns go to waste, right? Another reason I thought I wouldn't care for the movie is that I hate the Boston Red Sox
The mere mention of Pedro Martinez' name sends me running to the bathroom
Louis Cardinals fan, still believes the World Series was rigged last year
She refuses to believe the Sox won it legitimately
But I'm man enough to admit that Fever Pitch caused me to sympathize, albeit only slightly, with the plight of Red Sox fans
<br /><br />Anybody who has a passion for sports will be able to relate to this movie on some level
Unless you have a favorite sports team you can't fully understand the extreme highs and lows that a fan such as Fallon's Ben can go through
There's nothing quite so fresh as the smell of a new season and nothing quite so smooth as a clean slate
"Wait 'til next year," becomes your mantra, your motto, your prayer - and Fever Pitch effectively captures that essence
<br /><br />I love the fact that the movie takes a fictional story and throws it against the real-life backdrop of the Red Sox' improbable World Series run last year
I don't love it so much that I want to marry it, but you know what I mean
I expected this to be handled in a fairly cheesy manner, and while some of the humor is a little silly, it's actually pretty realistic
<br /><br />You see, Ben's uncle took him to his first Red Sox game when he was 7 years old, and when he died he left Ben his two season tickets
At the beginning of each season he has a draft day where he and his friends get together to figure out who gets to go to which games with him
He makes everybody dance for the Yankees games and whenever somebody complains he threatens them with tickets for the games with the Royals (sorry Mr
It's a very good scene, and it works so well because I actually know of people who do the "ticket draft day
" I also must admit that I can relate to when Ben goes to dinner with Lindsey and her parents
The Red Sox are playing a road game, but instead of watching it live on TV Ben decides to tape it
One of the most dangerous things in life is taping a game and then being in public and trying to avoid hearing the result
Weeeeeell, Ben enters the danger zone when a guy shows up at the restaurant and mentions watching the game
Ben immediately covers his ears and starts shrieking like a banshee so as not to hear the outcome
Lindsey is embarrassed, and her parents don't know what to think
Yeah, sports fans can be weird, I don't deny it
<br /><br />Now if you're expecting the crude, edgy stuff that the Farrelly brothers are known for then you could be disappointed
They do have their moments though, like when Ben says he likes how Lindsey sometimes talks out of the side of her mouth "like an adorable stroke victim," but overall this is definitely a softer, more romantic side that the bros are putting on display
<br /><br />That's not to say that the movie ever gets way too sappy
Thankfully, when the sap starts to ooze a bit, the Farrellys know when to pull away
A romantic moment with Lindsey jumping on the field and running over to Ben to declare her undying love for him turns into Ben sincerely replying, "You've gotta tell me about the outfield
Is it spongy?" Jimmy Fallon proves that with the right material he can handle himself well on the big screen, and Drew Barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comedy charm
Fever Pitch is just good, solid entertainment that takes a somewhat fresh look at the romantic comedy genre
It's a movie that guys and gals can both relate to
Particularly the guys who practice sports fanaticism at some point during the year and the ladies who must deal with 'em
<br /><br />Now if the Red Sox fans could please shut up about the "Curse of the Bambino" I would appreciate it
My Memphis Tigers have NEVER won the NCAA basketball championship, so I officially declare my plight greater than yours
<br /><br />THE GIST Fans of Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymore, romantic comedy, the Red Sox, baseball, or sports fanaticism in general should consider giving Fever Pitch a look
I wouldn't go out of my way to rush and see it at the first available time, but it'll make a great matinée
I have always been a huge James Bond fanatic! I have seen almost all of the films except for Die Another Day, and The World Is Not Enough
The graphic's for Everything Or Nothing are breathtaking! The voice talents
WOW! I LOVE PIERCE BROSNAN! He is finally Bond in a video game! HE IS BOND! I enjoyed the past Bond games: Goldeneye, The World Is Not Enough, Agent Under Fire, and Nightfire
This one is definitely the best! Finally, Mr
Brosnan as a sign of respect? Yes I can!) He was phenomenally exciting to hear in a video game
AT LONG LAST! DUH! I've seen him perform with Robin Williams, and let me tell you, they make a great team
Pierce Brosnan is funny, wickedly handsome ( I mean to say wickedly in a good way,) and just one of those actor's who you would want to walk up to and wrap your arms around and hug, saying: "Pierce Brosnan, thank you for being James Bond," "If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't know who James Bond is
" He's a great actor! I am a huge fan of Willem Dafoe even though I've seen him in a couple of movies
His role as Nikolai Diavalo was brilliant
(Did I spell the character's name right?) LOL!!!! He does a great job with an accent
Dafoe, perform in two movies: Finding Nemo, and Spider-Man with my favorite actress: KIRSTEN DUNST! SHE ROCKS! Anyway, He never ceases to amaze
And Richard Kiel, wow, he's definitely got the part of Jaw's nailed
I've seen him in the movie's and he's awesome! As a matter of fact, my Grandparent's have met Mr
Kiel, and I was jealous when they told me
But, Kirsten Dunst is at the top of my list of Celebritie's that I want to meet
I have never seen a better person play as the wisecracking, and gadget creating Q! Mr
Cleese was hilarious! I've seen him work with Pierce Brosnan in Goldeneye and Tommorow Never Dies
He's awesome! John Cleese's most recent project is Shrek 2 starring Mike Myer's, Cameron Diaz, Julie Andrew's and Eddie Murphy
( Shrek 2 is now in theatre's!) GOOD LUCK 007! Oh, yeah, and as Q alway's says: "Grow up 007!
I admit I've only seen about three of Shakespeare's plays (Romeo & Juliet, Macbeth, & of course Hamlet) one I liked, the other I found so-so (Macbeth), and Hamlet I just found a masterpiece
I'm pleased to tell you that this adaptation is every bit as good as the intense and dramatic play
The acting is extremely strong (With a cast that features Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams, and Billy Crystal how can you lose?) and the change in time period (Looks like somewhere between the 17 and 1800's) plays off beautifully as the characters move about and say their infamous lines straight from the script itself that any fan of the Shakespearean play will get chills from
If you're into this popular drama I highly urge you to watch this powerful 1996 adaptation from Shakespearean admirer Kenneth Branagh
I remember the first time I saw this movie -- I was in the office working over the weekend & the TV was on for background noise
But I gradually found myself more & more engaged in this movie I'd never seen or heard of, until I was completely absorbed
A Matter of Life & Death (the British title -- Stairway to Heaven in the US) is delightful, compelling, whimsical, & moving, all in one superbly-written, well-acted, perfectly-directed package
It's a classic that really does rank right up there with Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane, & Chariots of Fire
WHY has it never received the same public notice & video-store prominence? Fortunately, SOME knowledgeable critics HAVE put it on their "Top 100 of all time" lists
There IS hope -- 1940's Fantasia wasn't a hit 'til the '60s, & the Wizard of Oz was a dud at the box office, but made a hit by TV
Buy it -- rent it -- watch it -- demand it! You WON'T be disappointed
With lots of sunshine, gauzy light and shadow filtering through windows and into rooms, tracking shots moving through crowds with hand-held camera, quick-paced editing and extreme close-ups here and there, the photography is the thing in this interesting, artistically done film
<br /><br />The plot of this film starts out as a bit of fluff about a beauty contest
The film begins on a warm Sunday at the local swimming pool, where we meet the lovely Lucienne aka Lulu (played by Louise Brooks) - a bit of a show-off in front of the gawking men by poolside, she soon decides to enter herself to represent France in the Miss Europe beauty contest, much to the chagrin of her very jealous, stick-in-the-mud fiancé (a pretty annoying fellow, really)
Strutting down the runway the ten contestants display themselves in swimsuits, while the winner is chosen as the contestant who receives the longest applause (I was wondering, couldn't the girls just walk slower to prolong their length of time - and thus applause - on the catwalk?!)
Lulu is soon being chased by a Prince and a Maharaja, but her hot-headed beau doesn't like the attentions paid to her by other men or her adoring public, for that matter (I guess he just wants her in his house, cooking his meals, and staying out of sight, eh?!)
<br /><br />Louise Brooks is beautiful and charming, her presence helps enhance this film, but it's really the way it is photographed that held my interest the most
A bit distracting is the odd dubbed sound, which is a bit off
The print on this version looked very clear and full of nice contrast though
Watching this I just tried to overlook the sound problems and watch the film visually, and I found the movie to be excellent, well worth seeing
Being a fan of Andy Goldsworthy's art for a while now, and owning some of his books, I had some expectations of what I would see
What I got was something completely satisfying, and quite a bit more than I expected
Being an artist myself (I work in clay), finding inspiration within our surroundings to make good art is imperative, and it is something Andy Goldsworthy has mastered
Following him over the course of a year, the director captures the spontaneous energy, skill, and devotion to the artists connection with nature with dratic inspiring flair
The music set to the film is embracing and intoxicating
If you are an artist in need of inspiration, or anyone else in need of an uplifting experience, then SEE THIS MOVIE
I for one am glad to know that Andy is somewhere out there
Creating, dancing, wrestling with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful
Not something thrown together to make a couple of rich actors, even richer!! As most movies that are based on books, there are somethings that just don't fit
Only a couple of people have stated that this movie was based on real events, not a knock-off as most people believe it is!! This movie is in no way related too TWISTER! Other than both movies are about tornadoes
<br /><br />For those of you who have problems with the science of the tornadoes and storms in the movie, there are a couple of things you need to remember
The actual "night of the twisters" was June 3, 1980
So this movie was released 16 years after the actual events
Try think how far storm research has advanced in that time
It happened in a larger town; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state
Even though the movie calls the town something else, and says it's a small town
This is a great entertaining action film in my opinion, with cool characters, lots of action, and an amazing performance from Dolph Lundgren, however Alex Karzis is awful as the villain!
The story is very good, and i found the kids to be likable for the most part, plus Dolph Lundgren is simply amazing in this!
The action scenes are excellent, and it's almost like Die Hard except it's set in a school!, plus Kata Dobó is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick!
The finale is very exciting, and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well!, however i just wished it had another villain, because Alex Karzis just didn't cut it as the villain way too OTT, and laughable for my tastes
1 in my opinion, as i thought it was a great action film, and while the kids, were very stupid at times, they got quite resourceful as the movie went along!, plus the shootouts were pretty cool as well!
The ending is very amusing,and Corey Sevier's character was my favorite student!, plus Dolph has still got it!
This is a great entertaining action film in my opinion, with cool characters, lots of action, and an amazing performance from Lundgren!, but Alex Karzis is awful as the villain, still i highly recommend this one!
Furie does a very good job here with great camera work, good angles, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!
We get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds,knife in the side of the head, bloody arrow hits, an impaling, and other minor stuff
Dolph Lundgren is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, kicks that ass as usual, had great chemistry with the kids, had an awesome character, is very charismatic, and he may not have shown a great emotional rage, he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch!, he is one of my favorite actors! (Lundgren Rules!!!!!)
Alex Karzis is god awful as the villain, he is laughably OTT, was boring, and not menacing at all, he also annoyed the crap out of me
Kata Dobó is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do, she was the real villain in my opinion!
Corey Sevier is funny as Mick, he was my favorite student, and i really started to warm up to him in the 2nd half, i liked him a lot!, he had good chemistry with Dolph too
Dov Tiefenbach(Willy),Chris Collins(Hogie),Mpho Koaho(Jay Tee),Danielle Hampton(Alicia),Nicole Dicker(Charlee) all do great as the students
Jennifer Baxter is very cute and is good as The fiancée
Fear of a black hat is a hilarious spoof of Hip-Hop culture
It is just as funny as This Is Spinal Tap, if not funnier
The actors are incredible and the documentary style is superb
Mark Christopher Lawrence is a tremendous talent that should be starring in a lot more films
When I first heard about the title, I thought of 'The Simpsons', just like so many other reviewers, but when I saw the cast, I was completely stunned, that so many great character-actors would actually be in this! First of all, we have Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction), who plays the title character, McBain
He is rescued from a Vietnam POW-camp by some of his buddies, one of which is Santos (Chick Vennera, Yanks), who splits a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL with McBain (Vietnam soldiers are loaded with cash apparently), and tells him that he can re-do the favor to him, if he ever gets into trouble
<br /><br />Then, 18 years later, Santos and his sister Christina (Maria Conchita Alonso, The Running Man, Predator 2) join the rebels in Colombia trying to get rid of their evil dictator, El Presidente (Victor Argo, Taxi Driver, King of New York), and when Santos fails the mission, Christina goes to McBain for help
<br /><br />McBain then asks his good ol' Vietnam buddies to help him
First there's the token tough black guy, Eastland, played by "American Ninja"'s Steve James, who was also in director James Glickenhaus' previous movie, "The Exterminator", where the exterminator's real name also was Eastland, coincidence? I think not
There is also a lot of other references to The Exterminator, among other things, the most notable one being that McBain himself wears a welders-mask when Christina sees him for the first time, when he is working on a welding-job on top of a bridge! <br /><br />The other guys in the Vietnam-pack are: The rich guy who can afford all sorts of equipment for the team, Frank Bruce (Michael Ironside, Total Recall, Starship Troopers), and then there's the doc, Dalton, (played by Jay Patterson, who doesn't look like the guy the IMDb is linking to, and I haven't seen him in other movies, so who knows), and last but not least, there's the cop, Gill, who has had enough of his unsatisfying job, he's played by Thomas G
Waites, who some of us might remember from The Warriors and The Thing
<br /><br />And in other big roles, we find Luis Guzmán (Boogie Nights, Carlito's Way), as a small-time drug-dealer who can't get a decent job
Also, there is Dick Boccelli as the drug-dealing kingpin who gets hung up in a crane on top of a roof by the McBain-gang, almost Exactly in the same way he got hung up over a meat-grinder by John Eastland in the EXTERMINATOR-movie! Now, I haven't seen Glickenhaus' "Shakedown/Blue Jean Cop" yet, but I'm almost ready to bet half a hundred-dollar bill that Boccelli gets hung up in that movie too! <br /><br />Well, back to the plot of this movie
they go off to Colombia and saves the day, yay! But who cares about the plot anyway, the cast is great, and the action-scenes are very well done, and you're never bored while watching this movie! Highly recommended to all action-lovers
This would have worked a lot better if it had been made as "Mitchell in Malta
" At least then we would have been spared the sight of Joe Don Baker running around an otherwise scenic Mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit
not to mention acting like an Old West gunslinger
Mitchell being Mitchell, the film wouldn't have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either
At least the comic comments of Mike and the Bots made this enjoyable fare as an episode of MST
I can't imagine watching it on it's own, however
I don't believe this was an acting challenge for Richard Harris
This was an uncomplicated plot, yet interesting
It is a good movie to watch when you don't want to do a lot of thinking, just want to be told a simple story
The beautiful Fall shots alone made the picture worth seeing
Anyone who doesn't think Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is one of the greatest movies of all time needs their head checked
It somehow manages to be both completely inane and no-brainer, but also terrifying knowing and clever at the same time
One of those rare films that actually improves upon it predecessor, Bogus Journey can be enjoyed again and again
Notable highlights include the duel with Death and the ending, which is highly "emotional"
Keanu wants to forget all that Matrix rubbish and get down to doing what he does best, Ted Theodore Logan in Bill and Ted: The Return
First off, I would just like to say what a big fan of Bette Midler's I am
Stella is a very good movie with a wonderful cast (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason) This is one of my favorite films of all time
It deals with a mother raising a child on her own, she goes through a lot of things that are out of her way to bring up her daughter Jenny played wonderfully by Trini Alvarado
This movie is very good and I suggest that you pick up a copy to watch it
Roger Ebert gave is 3 1/2 stars! And it deserved 4! WONDERFUL! I give it 4 out of 4
Cosimo (Luis Guzman) ends up in prison for car burglary and there he's given the plan for the perfect heist from a lifer in prison; so he has to get out of jail, fast
He tells his girlfriend Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson) to find a man who will do his time in prison for some money
But no one wants to do the time for Cosimo's crime and yet everybody seems to know a guy who will do that
Soon bad boxer Pero Mahalovic (Sam Rockwell) founds out the details of this so called "perfect job"
<br /><br />First of all, I think this movie was very funny and from my point of view I would recommend it to everyone
This movie is remake of Italian comedy "I Soliti Ignoti"
I didn't watch the Italian original so I cannot judge or compare those two movies
But "Welcome to Collinwood" is great comedy for itself, about four people trying to rob the money from the vault in one house
Everyone gave their part of brilliance from this movie cast
Really excellent movie for these actors: Sam Rockwell, William H
Macy (great), Isaiah Washington, Michael Jeter (great), Luis Guzmán, Patricia Clarkson, Jennifer Esposito and finally George Clooney gave their share in this project
<br /><br />Maybe to say that this movie is only comedy, isn't fair
All of thieves in this movie have very small wishes when they are asked: what will they do with their money? It is mostly securing their future in very humble way
This fact goes beyond comedy into the soul of that criminals
And not only them but also cop Babitch, who is presented like corrupted one; so here directors Russo presents us fact that criminals and cop are the same
Actually all in Collinwood are; and not only in Collinwood, cause all people chase money, on legal or illegal way
I don't like all movies were audience eventually likes and cheers for thieves
Riley with his little baby and wife in jail
Cosimo with his line: "Your mother's a whore!" and all others
They are just like characters in my favorite comic, Alan Ford
They all trying to make some money, but simply they are out of luck
But they all did one good deed: they gave money to Riley, so he can get his wife out of prison
They are all heroes in my eyes, cause lots of "honest" people wouldn't do that
Forbidden Planet represents the kind of science fiction that is precious in cinema, especially from the 1950s
There was The Day the Earth Stood Still and War of the Worlds, but lest not forget this gem which took some of its story from Shakespeare's The Tempest to tell a tale of astronauts on a planet that has a doctor on it who has made a remarkable breakthrough
It's the kind of breakthrough that is not so much incredible to look at (though for 1956 it does look quite amazing to look at some of those sets and that gigantic machine the doctor creates), but with its emphasis on the characters and its themes of technology taken too far by the more primitive side of human nature even when we don't know we're channeling it
<br /><br />On the surface- that is in the first ten minutes- it looks standard, if a little more professionally acted and directed with better skill than the B-movies of the period
A ship of astronauts are on a mission to the planet Altair-4 to bring back an expedition that went missing decades before
Morbis (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter, who somehow were immune to an attack that left everyone else dead
Morbius appears to be a cordial and highly intelligent man, and his technology looks to be so impressive that the only thing the astronauts, led by the Skipper (Leslie Nielsen), can think to do is to report it back to their superiors on Earth
<br /><br />But there's a catch - something is killing off members of the crew of the ship, one by one, every night, even when the others keep an eye out and then put up an invisible electric fence, which the invisible something goes through easily
Meanwhile, there's some romance possibly between the Skipper and Alraira, and there's a more pushy vibe from the doctor: you shouldn't have come to the planet to start, and now you need to go
What happens from this is even more fascinating, just on a purely intellectual level, but Forbidden Planet never forgets that its audience should also be entertained by this story while getting some useful ideas
While everyone may remember Robbie the Robot, and for good reason, perhaps the most unforgettable image for me is the monster realized on screen with the crew firing to no avail, animated with red electricity and looking so beastly that it looks out of Fantasia
<br /><br />The acting from Pidgeon is subtle: you wouldn't expect him to be a villain, though something is there in the character and in the performance that speaks to this, and by the end it makes the character far more complex than one would expect
And the other performances are workmanlike but also excellent, from Nielsen as a born leader to Holliman providing some great comic relief as the Cook (who, I should add, helps with one of the funniest scenes in the film with those gallons of bourbon Robbie provides)
And the effects for its time are extraordinary (sophisticated in a nostalgic pulp way for today too), and the music, done by electronics, is beautiful in its "tones"
But ultimately it's the screenplay and careful direction from Hilcox that puts this a notch above the rest of the B-movie lot
When it's meant to be funny, it's intentionally so and it works
When it's dramatic it connects quite well even in its stiff moments with the actors
And when we are made to think about a horrible situation, it comes on gradually, with nuance, not shoved in our faces or injected with mega-action
<br /><br />An inspiration for many other sci-fi films, and a fine marker of thoughtful science fiction stories and books from time-old, it's a classy and entertaining classic
What can I say? An excellent end to an excellent series! It never quite got the exposure it deserved in Asia, but by far, the best cop show with the best writing and the best cast on televison
It bombed in the States and as a result received only a limited showing in Britain
Which was a great shame, because it represents British rather than American humour and should have been shown in Britain first
<br /><br />Nicole Kidman looks stunning and is a totally convincing Russian
Ben Chaplin is the Dustin Hoffman character from 'The Graduate', and 'Birthday Girl' has at least 4 scenes which remind the viewer of that 1960s classic (despite being a totally different story!)
<br /><br />Sure it changes tack a number of times from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure - but it's memorable, moving and a weclome breath of fresh air compared to the average mega-budget blockbuster
This is one of my all time favorite movies, PERIOD
I can't think of another movie that combines so many nice movie qualities like this one does
This flick has it all: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Good vs
Bad and even some Romance (without even an innocent "peck" on the cheek between the Pazu and Sheeta)
Maybe best of all, you don't have to be in Mensa to "get it" and enjoy the movie like you do with some of Miyazaki's other movies (I don't know about you, but I watch movies to take a break from thinking)
This is just a flat-out enjoyable movie that everyone will like, so do yourself a favor and go buy it
The only sour note is the American Dubbing
I found Vander-Geek to be just plain annoying
But all is not lost, the original Japanese version is on the two-disc set and it rocks! Who cares if you can't understand spoken Japanese? If you can read at a second-grade level then watch the original Japanese recording with English subtitles
The Haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house, good effects work and sound work, a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house
There are scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found interesting
There are genuinely creepy moments in the film and I liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself
Jerry Goldsmith's score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you
What I wish could've happened is for something a little more intense
Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much
Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds up
The Haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror
The ending was for me, a little anticlimactic
The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump
Though the story is essentially routine, and the "surprise" ending is nothing but a bad joke on the audience, you can see what attracted these good actors to the project - it offers them the kind of roles in which good actors can shine, and shine they do
The film is impeccably made - for its time
It was remade in 2000 as "Under Suspicion" and if you only want to see one version of the story (that's all it deserves, really), I recommend the latter one, with Hopkins' up-to-date direction and the more explicit references to plot points that the original could only hint at
A truly adorable heroine who, at turns, is surprised and terrified by giblets, wrestles with mattresses, runs full-on into closed doors
just a few of the moments that sparkle in my memory of 'The Naked Truth'
I LOVED what I caught of this show: enjoyably daft plots and some good supporting characters provided the setting for the diamond of the show - Tea Leoni as, 'Nora Wilde'; cute, clownish, and wonderfully accident-prone - How refreshing to see an actress who can clown - it's no wonder Hollyood doesn't seem to know how to cast her
But where-oh-WHERE are the DVD releases? The amount of (bleep) they release, it's incredible me that this little gem continues to remain buried
The most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created
I cried the whole way through, from start to end
Watching the show you are immediately captured by a man's struggle to live without pain, to live a life we would take for granted
The first time I heard the title, I was almost scared to see the program, it was hard for me to comprehend living in agony every day of every year of my life
The saddest part of the documentary is when Jonny picks out his coffin
Could you imagine doing that? Even more so, even though he was in excruciating and unbearable pain he still opened up his own charity
(DEBRA)Jonny is one of the only people that deserves true respect and admiration, he is the definition of a role model, what a true and undeniable hero he was
I just saw this film @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival)
Fans of Hal Hartley will not be disappointed!! And if you are not familiar with this director's oeuvre
This film can definitely stand all on its own
it was amazing I need to see it again -- and fast!! <br /><br />This film is very funny
It's dialogue is very smart, and the performance of Parker Posey is outstanding as she stars in the title role of Fay Grim
Fay Grim is the latest feature revisiting the world and characters introduced in the film Henry Fool (2000)
Visually, the most salient stylistic feature employs the habitual use of the canted (or dutch) angle, which can be often seen in past Hartley works appearing in various shorts, available in the Possible Films: short works by Hal Hartley 1994-2004 collection, and in The Girl from Monday (2005)
<br /><br />I viewed this film most aptly on Sept 11th
Textually, Fay Grim's adventure in this story is backdropped against the changed world after September 11, 2001
Without going into major spoilers, I view this work, and story-world as a bravely political and original portrait of geo-politics that is rarely, if ever, foregrounded in mainstream fictional cinema post-911 heretofore (cf
<br /><br />Lastly, for those closely attached to the characters of Henry Fool, Simone, Fay and Henry this film is hilariously self-conscious and self-referential
That being said, the character of Fay Grimm starts off in the film, exactly where she was when Henry Fool ended, but by the end of the film
Fay's knowledge and experience has total changed and expanded over the course of the narrative
What can be in store for the future of Fay and the Fool family
?? I can't wait for the third part in this story
The King of Masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship
Set in 1930s China during a time of floods, we meet Wang, an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him
When a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends Wang, he invites Wang to join their troupe
However, we learn that Wang's family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son
Learning that Wang is childless, Wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever
Taking the advice to heart, Wang purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy; he would teach his new son, Doggie, the ancient art of silk masks
Soon, Wang discovers a fact about Doggie that threatens the rare and dying art
<br /><br />Together, Wang and Doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it
The setting is serene and the costuming simple
Summarily, it is an International Award winning art film which can't help but to move and inspire
I found this very touching as Spike and Heaton stay together all the way through this film not to say there isn't a few betrayals along the way
I thought the chase was put aside the relationship between the two was foreground I think
I had already guessed that there were so gay intentions on the part of Heaton
My favourite scene had to be the bit where Heaton and Spike were stuck in the marsh and Spike runs off I generally thought Spike wasn't coming back
I have to say that if it wasn't for our film studies teacher making us watch this I would have probably never seen it
Overall I thought this film was pretty good and I would recommend it to any person who is a fan of British made films
Jeremy Brett is simply the best Holmes ever, narrowly edging out the great Basil Rathbone of course, and this is probably the best adaptation of a Conon-Doyle short story
<br /><br />A length adaptation includes some new plot strands that fit in well to the surrounding drama and heightens the hatred one feels for Milverton
<br /><br />Excellent performances all round, especially from Robert Hardy, and both Brett and Hardwick fully rounded and comfortable in their roles makes this a superb piece of drama
(originally a response to a movie reviewer who said A Bug's Life was too much, too fast--he was "dazed and exhausted" by the visuals, and seemed to ignore the story completely)<br /><br />Okay, first off, I'm 26 years old, have a job, go to school, and have a fiance'
So maybe I'm nuts and just really good at hiding it
but not only did I NOT come away from A Bug's Life exhausted or dazed, it wasn't until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals--because the first time I went to see this movie, I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I FORGOT that I was supposed to be sitting there being "wowed" by each frame visually
How can you not empathize with Flik and his road-to-heck-paved-with-good-intentions life? "Heck" indeed, I found myself identifying with that little ant (not to mention some of the other bugs) in a lot more ways than one
and that, in itself, says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy
Of course, it's beautiful (every blade of grass, the tree, the rain
Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing (you can read their lips! try it!)
But this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech, not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color
No, A Bug's Life would be static if it were all that and no story
But, I'm glad to say, it's not! A Bug's Life has real heart
Yes, there's a lot going on, storyline-wise as well as visually, but that's because the story and characters actually have some depth to them! Just because it's a kids' movie doesn't mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door--kids are smarter than you think! Besides that, I think that the PIXAR crew made this for themselves, even before their kids
and it shows, in the amount of heart in has
This movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing
The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there's a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general
It doesn't hit you over the head with its points once it's made them--every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots
Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not "dumbing down" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not
All I can think is, if you can see A Bug's Life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others
Final words: A+ rating from me; please, if you're going to see it try to see it in the theatre (pan and scan video is NOT going to work for this movie); if you loved Toy Story you'll most likely love this (PIXAR knows how to make movies with heart); if you do love it see it multiple times or you STILL won't know what you're missing (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and whenever you're feeling really low, just pretend it's a seed, okay
I stumbled upon this movie on cable and was totally hooked
The story of a group of surfers who ride the big waves, waves that are monstrously huge, waves that would make any rational person run away in terror is a one that manages to be spectacular and make you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves
There is nothing special about the film, other than it brings together some very interesting people who are are in love with what they do and lets them talk
Sure there are scenes of them surfing, but what makes this movie so special is the people
Here are a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do that it crosses over to the people watching
Half way into this movie you'll want to go off and learn to surf as well
Few documentaries have ever managed to covey the passion that these people have and its the films ability to make us feel it that makes this a great film
While I have a great respect for Disney's animated films, as of late they haven't really been what I would call "must-see"
Atlantis looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer, and thankfully lived up to my expectations
<br /><br />Atlantis is a more "mature" Disney film in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual trait for a Disney film indeed), and is focused more on action and discovery than any other recent Disney offering
The world of Atlantis, hidden beneath the earth's core, is fantastic, presented as desolate caverns with ruins, and then slowly developing into actual ecosystems, which, while usually containing some reminder of harshness, become more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is reached
The presentation of simply Atlantis' landscape and setting, without some expendable cheery song, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance
The inclusion of an Atlantean language, as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of real-life ancient civilizations adds to this, and works fairly well
<br /><br />Also, with the exception of some scenes involving Mole's practical jokes, there didn't seem to be much of a "childish" element that I usually associate with Disney films
Instead, the main elements were the struggle to get to Atlantis, and the constant discovery that occurred at Atlantis, as Milo the outsider was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the Atlanteans discover parts of their own history that they didn't know about
Part of this involves the Atlantean "weaponry", which is used in a very action-packed climax which is, for lack of a better word, quite exciting
<br /><br />Granted, not all of the story makes full sense, and the film doesn't feature any amazing new computer-generated visual effects, but, aside from the Toy Story movies, this is the most entertaining Disney film I've seen in years
Being from the Philadelphia suburbs and extremely interested in local history, this film provides an excellent vintage view of Philadelphia in the 1940s
There are scenes of downtown, a train station that no longer exists, 30th Street Station--which still does exist, as well as scenes from the Northeast part of the city
Good shots of the old row-homes as they appeared then
The movie gets a bit "chatty" at times - causing the viewer to briefly lose interest
but the overall storyline is solid and very moving
Anyone who enjoyed this movie should also try to see the film "Bright Victory", also with local footage of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, PA - and scenes from downtown Phoenixville
The Army Hospital has since become a college campus
Neither of these films are out on any format and I can't imagine why
I have them both on VHS from home recording, as shown on TCM in recent years
I highly recommend them to any other history buffs out there from my area
Russell, my fav, is gorgeous in this film
But more than that, the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow
Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected
The film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity
Fabulous love story between Lachlin and Lil
I replay their scenes over and over again
Anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people
All characters are cast and portrayed excellently
Like A Streetcar Named Desire (also directed by Gadg both on stage and screen) Panic In The Streets depicts a New Orleans in which its major claim to fame - the birthplace of Jazz - doesn't even rate a mention
It was Richard Widmark's seventh film and arguably went a long way to establishing him as the fine actor he really was rather than merely a psychotic killer
Gadg himself appears in an uncredited small role as a morgue attendant but the film is rich in talent beginning with Jack Palance (still being billed as Walter Jack Palance)as the local Mr 'Big' followed side-kick Zero Mostel, Barbara Bel Geddes, Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig plus the rock-solid ever reliable Paul Douglas as the cop who comes round to doc Widmark's point of view
It's a very rewarding movie more so for being little seen
I first saw this film when I was about 8 years old on TV in the UK (where it was called "Laupta: The Flying Island")
I absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and I missed it
I was enchanted by the story and characters, but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music
It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the "Streamline Dub" (the dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set
<br /><br />Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney
The voice acting is OK but the dialogue doesn't have the same raw energy that the "streamline" dub or the original Japanese had, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead
They have made some pointless alterations, such as changing the main character's name from "Pazu" to "Patzu", and added some dialogue
But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to Disney's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking, which I find annoying in many Disney films
<br /><br />This film still blows away most recent animated films, and I cannot recommend it highly enough
The plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass-market, homogenized animation
This sweeping drama has it all: top notch acting, incredible photography, good story
It is often compared to "Braveheart" because both movies take place in historical Scotland
Even though I love Braveheart, I think this is the better of the two films
Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance (should have been nominated for an Oscar)
Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role
Tim Roth plays one of the most evil, despicable, characters in film history (he was nominated for an Oscar)
John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose, another dislikeable character
I am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that John Hurt can play
This is a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose
Rob Roy is a self made man, who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his sense of honor
Montrose, who, inherited his title, has no sense of honor
And that is basically what this story is all about; honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility
This movie is very entertaining, it should appeal to all
It has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and has a exciting plot
The bittersweet twist to this movie contains a wonderful element of romanticism that evokes an impetuous passion! These characteristics of idealistic imagery which "Moonstruck" possesses, spur on an end result of a resounding thumbs up verdict by virtually every prominent critic in Hollywood
Let me describe the circumstances to this film, simply put, they are "yesteryear"
"Moonstruck" is a cohesive film which sparks the naivety of an old Italian neighborhood in New York City
New York City has always been one big melting pot that is galvanized by many bicker-some mannerisms which are indicative of typical New Yorkers, this includes a lot of Italian Americans living in New York as well! The mid and late eighties brought on an abrupt conclusion to many strong associations with various cultural stereotypes
Ethnicity polarization was a firmly embedded scourge in American history that was far more prevalent several generations before this movie was made
These generalizing proclivities still exist today, however, they are more mollified and less identifiable! For this Italian family of a bygone era, confusion, indecisiveness, agitation, and yes, of course, love, all have the comical camaraderie of an utterly human understanding to them! The kindred spirits with everyone in "Moonstruck" seems to be that of comprehending individual frailties
One might wonder about Cher playing the lead role, as she is more known as an entertainer than a big box office first billing star in a movie
In "Moonstruck", however, I think she was incredibly well suited to her role, and came off as thoroughly believable in a relatively unbelievable situation
All of the characters in "Moonstruck" are very rough around the edges, really tough, and not afraid to have a formidable duel with adversity
The most hilarious aspect to their lives is imperfection, and they are thoroughly aware of the fact that weathering the storm definitely serves a constructive purpose! I thought the acting in this movie was sensational
All relationships in this movie garner an auspicious potential to vividly illuminate because everybody knows how everybody else's basic nature is really like!! For this family, nothing is glamorous, nothing is pretentiously romantic, and nothing is overly emotional (just moderately so)
The fact is, this entire family is plainly and perpetually afflicted and overcome by an extremely zealous and candid cupid in all of their lives
Taking moon beams literally can indeed have a pleasantly enervating impact on one's resolve, masqueraded mystique, and resistance to the proverbial am ore'
Thus signifying everything!! The homey and mercurial tenet in this film is basically one of ; Be honest, get angry; Be honest, get confrontational; Be honest, get distorted and emphatic; Most importantly; Be honest, and fall in love!! This is Cher's best performance ever as an actress!! Nicholas Cage, Danny Aiello, and Olympia Dukakis, were wonderfully flawed in "Moonstruck" Such performances by these three were perfectly appropriate for the kinetic energy of the characters in this movie! Director, Norman Jewison (Famous for "Cincinnati Kid", "Thomas Crowne Affair", and most famous for "In The Heat Of The Night" which won the academy award for best picture in 1967) depicts many keen and humanistic instincts in the process of purveying the deliberate incongruity to this film! I am Italian American in descent, (Partially anyways) Cher is not Italian, and, for that matter, neither is the writer nor the director! I guess since non-Italians like eating our food, they may as well use our culture to make a fabulous film too! It is refreshing to know that a film can be marvelous and have an incredibly happy ending!! For those of you who didn't like this movie, I just have one thing to say "Snap Out Of It!!" This movie "Moonstruck" is totally happy go lucky!! Totally eighties!! and Totally five stars!! See it!
Just came out of a sneak preview for this film
The ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing I hadn't bought that large coke
There are definitely some lulls, but, overall, highly entertaining
The movie lets Steve Carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both Jim Carrey in "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in their movies
I love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas (like P
I think that Seth Rogen should be getting more work, because he so freaking talented and engaging
Leslie Mann also had some incredibly funny moments
I highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac
However, if you're easily offended, don't see this movie
If you're a rabid feminist, don't see this movie
And, please, not matter what, even if you think you're one of those "hip" parents, don't take your kids to this movie
Sure, you should let your teens go see this movie, just don't watch it with them
It would make for some incredibly awkward moments
Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the manager of the New York's longest- established floating craps game, and he needs $1000 to secure a new location
Confident of his odds, he bets the city's highest-roller, Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), that he can't woo uptight missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons)
'Guys and Dolls (1955)' is such a great musical because it deftly blends the contrasting styles of film and stage
During a dazzling opening sequence, crowds of pedestrians move in rhythm, stopping and starting as though responding to backstage cues
Even the walking movements themselves are stylised and angular, halfway between a walk and a dance
Mankiewicz's New York City is a glittering flurry of art deco colour and movement, a fantasy world so completely removed from reality that even the business of underground gambling and criminal thuggery seems perfectly genial
<br /><br />As I write this review, I've just received word that Jean Simmons has passed away, age 80
This, unbelievably, was the first time I'd seen her in a film, yet she dazzled me from the beginning
Her idealistic and sexually-repressed Sarah comes out of her shell following an alcohol binge in Havana, letting loose with an adorably playful rendition of "If I Were A Bell
" Even though both Simmons and Brando were non-singers, producer Sam Goldwyn decided not to dub their vocals, contending that "maybe you don't sound so good, but at least it's you
" Despite Goldwyn's backhanded confidence, the pair both do well to carry entire musical numbers themselves
Simmons suggests the same child-like liveliness that Audrey Hepburn might have brought to the role, and Brando exudes such self-assurance and charisma that it doesn't matter that his singing voice isn't quite there
If you're amused by straight-faced goings-on that are logical within a given illogical situation, you'll enjoy this whimsical 8-minute Spanish film
The scene looks ordinary, but the counterman, customers, and two musicians seem somehow oddly subdued
<br /><br />Suddenly, the musicians play and one man begins to sing the title song , dancing across table tops with musical-comedy gestures
The customers, at first immobile, at intervals chime in (badly but gamely) with phrases from the song, read from slips of paper in their palms
On and off they jump up and dance (awkwardly but earnestly) in choreographed motions, like backup singers
The answer is revealed as the soloist's jacket opens and she sees what's strapped across his chest -- just before the explosive climax
<br /><br />Even if you don't catch the song's (probably ironical) lyrics, the situation-perfect performances should give you a grin and a chuckle
Having seen most of Ringo Lam's films, I can say that this is his best film to date, and the most unusual
It's a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick-ass martial arts, where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters
The action is fantastic, the story is tense and entertaining, and the set design is truely memorable
Sadly, Burning Paradise has not been made available on DVD and vhs is next-to-impossible to get your mitts on, even if you near the second biggest china-town in North America (like I do)
The story is good, acting is great, all technicals (especially cinematography) are sharp and the script is clever
<br /><br />Heath Ledger is terrific as Edward ''Ned'' Kelly
He is gripping as the legendary outlaw, and is supported well by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom
All action sequences are on point<br /><br />The film is edge-of-your seat stuff right up to to the end
One of my favourite films from the late legend Heath Ledger, who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in
I can't add an awful lot to the positive reviews already on here - great acting, balanced writing, multi-faceted characters, a great anti-hero in Tony, great commentary on millennial American life
The integral use of psychiatry coupled with Tony's mother issues are especially fresh and humorous
Several other characters add a lot of depth - Hesh's interesting history as an outsider muscling in, Ralphie's total irredeemable viciousness, Chris' dual desires in life, and so on
<br /><br />I have to dig into some of the criticisms however, especially the 'it glorifies violence/belittles Italian-Americans' one
Most of the writers and actors are Italian-American, would they attack themselves? There are several positive Italian-American characters - Artie Bucco the chef, Dr
Melfi and her family and the Cusamanos next door to the Sopranos
Indeed, Dr Melfi's ex-husband notes in season 1 that only a tiny minority of Italian-Americans have ever had Mob connections (certainly smaller than the proportion of African-Americans involved in crime, dare I say it
In both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causes)
<br /><br />Most of the characters don't really choose the life they have; family background or circumstances largely corner them into it
Outsiders (even of Italian stock) who attempt to integrate into it usually meet distressing ends - Matthew and his friend in season 2, for example
If you criticise this show, I assume Frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist, or Will & Grace made you want to go homosexual? Presumably you won't listen to rap music that discusses gangs, or r'n'b which discusses promiscuity, or rock music which discusses drugs (or any other combination)? People aren't as stupid as some of you make out
<br /><br />Not everything is perfect however
A lot of characters have only appeared once, when by all logic they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes - Tracee the dancer, Meadow's friend Ally, Uncle Junior's ladyfriend (supposedly for 20 years until they split in season 1)
Have you ever, or do you have, a pet who's been with you through thick and thin, who you'd be lost without, and who you love no matter what? Betcha never thought they feel the same way about you!<br /><br />Wonderful, wonderful family film
If you have a soft spot for animals, this is guaranteed to make you cry no matter your age
I used to watch this movie all the time when I was a little kid, and I find that now, at age sixteen, I love it as much as I did then
I could never decide on a favorite character then, and I still don't think I can! I love all three of the animals
The dialogue seems very real and comfortable, like a loving, but feuding family
I do love Chance, and how at the end he says that he has a family at last
Cheesy, yes, but one must remember that this is meant to be a family film, and it fulfills that role perfectly
Sassy has just the perfect dose of "sassiness" and Shadow is the perfect leader/role model to the young, adventurous Chance
<br /><br />The animals way outshine the humans, but of course most of the teary moments are to be had during an interaction with them (ie
Not to mention the incredible soundtrack that gives each moment even more emotion, and an accompanying heart-swelling feeling
To be compared to (and even rated better than) Cats and Dogs and Babe
We tend to forget that the master/slave context of the past centuries lead to more than well-tended estates, powered by large groups of enslaved people, and a lot of money for the white owners
It lead to a group of people caught in the middle - the offspring resulting from slave owners interferring with their female slaves
<br /><br />Some of these children just became more slaves, and others were free
but free and coloured, which back then meant anything but, relative to the lot of their sires
<br /><br />A class formed around these offspring - the gens de couleur libre or free people of colour - and that class was able, to a certain extent, to own property, raise themselves from downtrodden to educated, and to attain a comparative dignity
That is to say, they weren't slaves, but they were still exploited to a certain extent
<br /><br />Often, the women lived as mistresses to the white plantation masters and men of wealth, set up in their own houses, with allowances, schooling paid for for their children, and a kind of gentility, dependent on the respectability they chose to impose on their families
In essence, they were prostituting themselves to ensure their own prosperity, and relative independence from labour - an arrangement called plaçage
<br /><br />Feast of All Saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one such woman, the result of just such an arrangement with a local gentleman, and the people who touched on their lives, in both a negative and a positive way
The tale was an eye-opener for me, a New Zealander, with no real conception of the black/white lines, let alone that grey area in the middle where the gens de couleur libre trod gingerly
<br /><br />The characters are very three dimensional, and have been well-rendered in this adaption of the novel, by Anne Rice
The parts are well-cast, the costumes are wonderful, and the brutal way the lines are drawn out, with the blurred areas made all the more distinct by the conflicts the protagonists go through
The gens de couleur libre could not marry the whites, the slaves could not help themselves, and the whites, even the sympathetic ones, couldn't bear to face the economic reality of doing right by the people they depended on
<br /><br />I recommend this story, both the novel and the miniseries, to everyone, unreservedly
If you can't handle the truth you'll cringe and cower through some parts, as one injustice after another is meted out on those of colour, both by their white oppressors, and by their own people
Bear in mind though that this is nothing more than reality, and this tale is an absorbing way to learn about it
<br /><br />I know it may sound callous, but this miniseries both entertained me and enthralled me, despite the sour taste I found in my mouth at what went on, and I thoroughly enjoyed it
If not read up on the period, because there's a lesson to be learned from it all
Kalifornia is the story of a writer and his girlfriend photographer who are looking for someone to help pay gas money and take turns at the wheel for a cross country road trip to famous murder sights
Ironically a serial killer and his girlfriend answer the post
Kalifornia is a diamond in the rough and a very intriguing journey with a serial killer
Great performances all around by the leads with Pitt in particular being exceptional
Seeing "Moonstruck" after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally funny this film was when it first appeared
Who knew that Cher could act? Who had ever heard of Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comedic talents, nor was Norman Jewison the director
<br /><br />The only really flat note in this splendid work is "When the Moon Hits Your Eye Like a Big Pizza Pie, That's Amore," a song that is sung too many times in the movie (once is already too many) and that went on to have a long afterlife in popular music
<br /><br />Cher is -- forgive me -- sensational as Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to be married and does not have to be in love with the groom
Aielo (Johny Cammareri) obliges by proposing, offering her his pinkie ring as a substitute for an engagement ring, then rushes off to Sicily to be with his dying mother
He charges Loretta with seeing to that his estranged brother, Ronny, attends the wedding
Loretta confronts Ronny and quickly falls in love with him
Meanwhile, her father (Vincent Gardenia) is cheating on her mother (Olympia Dukakis), which Loretta accidentally discovers when Ronny invites her to the Metropolitan Opera
<br /><br />Everything works out in the end, as it inevitably does in films of this genre
In the meantime, all the actors acquit themselves admirably and the audience enjoys itself
In its way, "Moonstruck" is how Hollywood used to be at its best: rollicking entertainment with no social significance whatsoever
If they'd only lost "That's Amore" along the way, it would have been perfect
I found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while I tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why
One of the problems is the cultural/language one
Here we have a Chinese/Taiwanese/Japanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading English subtitles inevitably loose some of the subtleties
Another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and coincidences
Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that there is a wholly bad Miiki film and this certainly is not that
Plenty of stylish and bone crunching violence, a window upon some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect
All in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one
I swear, that zombie was killed like twice, and kept coming back
Let's face it folks, this is exactly what the other reviewers are saying, i
Hey, hey, hey, welcome to total indy film making
The fact that Todd Sheets got over 700 zombies to appear in this movie is a tribute to his talents
Yes, the story has gaps, yes, we see the same zombies over and over again, but who really cares? Take it for what it is, a fun and gory horror film, one to share with your buds, or to gross out the people you really care about LOL
Mellow out people, I suppose you all liked hunks of garbage like "Titanic" or "Twister" instead
Peace, and support independent film making!!
I have bought the DVD of this version to compare against the current BBC 2005 version (which is brilliant)
The 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft, who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for TV and who died this year (2005)
I remember great acting, especially from Rigg and Elliott, and moving music
(Music in the 2005 version is far more understated, but very telling
) Just to pick up other commentators on a couple of points: Richard Carstone is Ada Claire's boyfriend, not Esther's
Charlie Drake never played Krook in either version, nor did he play Toby Esterhase in TTSS! Krook is played by comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version
<br /><br />Both versions are honourable and admirable adaptations of Dickens' great novel
Now read the book! It's not perfect, and the sentimentality may make you wince at times, but I defy you not to cry - and laugh
Hidden Frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and to providing an example of the togetherness that was Gene Roddenberry's mission
Their focus on homosexuality, depression, war, and acceptance of different races is on par or exceeds those of the other Trek series and movies
The production value started off as smaller and choppy but over the 7 seasons of production the acting has improved, the stories are more complex, and the visual graphics have gotten smoother and more impressive
In season 6 episode 1, Countermeasures, there is one of the biggest space battles in Trek history
The ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting
The real draw to Frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds, but it is the people and the interplay and growth of characters
There are also nods to other Trek series and movies with places and characters we all know
I recommend any Trek fan to check out Countermeasures and you will be hooked
At first EVERYONE in the cast from Eric to Fez, they were all new actors and actresses, fresh faces, and just look what they accomplished
They stuck with the show and it was a success
Its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom I've ever seen in my life
It will be sad to see it end but if they end this show, I hope to God that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had
I don't care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode
The show deserves it, the fans deserve it, if they go, let everyone know its going to end, like on Friends, and let the finale be huge
I say get Donna and Eric married, I say have Hyde and Kelso fight and become friends again, I say have something interesting happen between Fez and Jackie because Fez has been trying for so long, but of course it wont work out for him
JUST CLOSE OUT THE SERIES BIG TIME GUYS!<br /><br />That 70s Show will always be the best in my eyes
Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I wish I had you guys as friends
I don't doubt that the critics panned this movie, especially the artsy fartsys who need a laxative
This is a great vehicle movie in the tradition of Abbot & Costello or more recently Don Knotts
It won't shake the world or change movies forever
When all is said & done that's the most important thing anyway
It even has a simple & kind moral message at no extra charge
I always loved Elvira's TV show when I lived in LA
She did not really steal her schtick from Vampira any more than Vampira did from the original, Theda Bara
This sort of mythic character belongs to whoever does it best; & Cassandra Peterson does it best
Long live Elvira; we need more of these kind of movies
The villain, William Morgan Sheppard, was also excellent
The execution is as close to flawless as the art form gets
My profound compliments to the director,James Signorelli,& all his crew
The Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy fashions natural materials into ephemeral artworks, assembling rocks into egg-shaped cairns, filling riverside rock-pools with fiery flowers and stitching thorns and twigs into intricate web patterns
An original work and a few photographs of his other creations are tucked away in a corner of Southampton art gallery (near where I live), but although I found these pieces intriguing, I only realised the wonder of Goldsworthy's work when I was lucky enough to catch a re-screening of Rivers and Tides
<br /><br />Thomas Reidelsheimer's film, accompanied by a beautiful instrumental soundtrack by Fred Frith, brings Goldsworthy and his art to life by showing the artist at work
The opening scene captures him fusing icicle fragments into a snake-like thread set atop a tree-stump
Working with his teeth and bare hands, Goldsworthy crafts a beautiful, ephemeral work
Before long this delicate sculpture melts away to nothing in the brilliant Nova Scotian sunlight
This scene is among the most beautiful in the film, but the breadth and inventiveness of Goldsworthy's work is remarkable
Reidelsheimer shows both the successes and the failures, capturing the frustration of pieces that collapse before they are completed as well as the glory of those that shine, even if for just a few hours, minutes or seconds
<br /><br />Goldsworthy himself provides the narration, speaking slowly but thoughtfully about the themes in his work
He makes plain his need to work with nature, to be alone in it and to further his understanding of it through trying to work with natural materials, even when they seem to be working against him
At times he is down-to-earth and humorous; at other times he struggles for the words to express his purpose  something which is quite understandable when witnessing his astonishing work first hand
The 'Rivers and Tides' of the title become increasingly pertinent as we see the natural materials pass through the artist's hands, flowing from one form to the next
The capture of the creation and dissolution of Goldworthy's work is in itself a striking piece of art
<br /><br />Although Goldsworthy works with widely varying materials and covers territory across North America and Europe, the presentation of artworks one after the other in this film is exhausting; it gave me the same feeling of fatigue that I get when I spend too long in an art gallery and struggle to take in anything new
A brief interval in which we are introduced to Andy's family and hometown is all that breaks the long succession of his artworks
Nevertheless, Reidelsheimer does a superb job in photographing Goldsworthy and his creations, locating them in their wider environments, from meandering Canadian rivers to rainy Scottish hillsides
Fittingly, the film ends with Goldsworthy casting handfuls of earth and snow into the sky
Fleeting patterns emerge from the dust particles even as they dissipate into the air; this is the purest expression of the beauty to be found in the work of this remarkable artist
How to lose friends and alienate people is decent comedy with a bit of romantic approach
<br /><br />It's actually a story of Sidney Young(Simon Pegg) breaking through in journalist and magazine writing business which is interpreted in a funny way
Simon Pegg made an OK appearance, slightly worse than his usual
Movie is not hilarious or funny all the way or anything like that but it has its moments, and those moments are really hilarious
<br /><br />I recommend this fun and worth watching American with English cream comedy to all people who just wanna sit, relax and enjoy movie for what it is
If you're about to watch this movie with critical approach then you should pass unless you want to be disappointed and start trashing it
I saw this important intense film tonight
Its Richard Gere and Claire's Dane's most important and best work
Gere deserves an Oscar for his fine portrayal of a man being forced into early retirement as a sex offender registrar administrator
Claire Danes is riveting as the woman Gere handpicks to replace him - a woman he tries to teach all he can while investigating one final case in which Gere's character is convinced one of those he is charged to monitor may be holding a young girl hostage
The subject matter is shocking, sex offenders and those who monitor them, but this film will not soon be forgotten
I know I will be haunted by Gere's portrayal for a very long time
Not since Anthony Hopkins portrayal of a serial killer has a screen portrayal terrified and so engaged me
The film opens with a shocking statistic so don't miss the opening credits
Richard Gere's finest role proving the man can act
Danes can as well and both do extraordinarily well in this often challenging film
<br /><br />This is a gutsy film and Gere gives a multi-layered deeply felt performance
Let me say first that this show was top tier when John Ritter was there
Upon his death, the show did drop off a bit, but the producers didn't give up on the show, adding James Garner and David Spade to the regular cast from 2003 to 2005
<br /><br />The show centers around the Hennessy family, Paul (John Ritter, may he rest in peace), his wife Cate (Katey Sagal), their daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson), and their son, Rory (Martin Spanjers)
When Ritter was on the show, I would shriek in laughter (and proud to admit it, I am), but now that he's gone, I'll only laugh a little with the occasional hearty laugh
I'm very glad that I fell for this show's trance after Ritter's untimely death, because it made the eps with Ritter so much better
<br /><br />Ritter's character is just so well acted and well rounded, that you can't help but love him
He is always bossing the girls around about dating, but he really wants them to be happy
It's the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainment
<br /><br />Katey Sagal is great as well, and she too is a likable character
After Ritter's death, her character provides such good influence and strength for not only her kids, but I believe Sagal has shaped the lives of Cuoco, Davidson, and Spanjers, because she and Ritter had been friends for a long time
<br /><br />The funniest person on the show would have to be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco
She is the ultimate blonde: gorgeous, slow, dim-witted, yet she is a smart person
She is off the wall hilarious with her innocent 'blonde' humor and how conceited she is
<br /><br />Amy Davidson can get a tad annoying as Kerry, but that's the purpose of her character
The only fault of the show is that the show never really gives Kerry anything to be happy about
She's always after Bridget, and her character feels like it's just thrown in there
<br /><br />Martin Spanjers as the lone Hennessy son is hysterical, and when Ritter is on the show, he's mostly comic material
Upon the death of Ritter, the show does provide some story lines for Rory
<br /><br />David Spade and James Garner are all nothing but laughs, with the occasional side story for C
Garner plays Cate's father, as a bit of background information
<br /><br />All in all, I give this show a great review because it is a great show that had a tragic event happen that crippled it
This is one of those movies that make better trailers than full-length feature films
The concept was really cool and different, the humor was unique, I just felt there were missed opportunities to put the "punch" into this movie
So many lines and gags were left hanging too long, with no definite ending and really didn't leave me laughing
Wilson, Wilson, Farris & Thurman were great
Wanda Sykes was under-used in this film and needed more exposure, and more opportunities to spin her character into more screen time
Also, I was looking for some sort of a feel-good music video during the end credits, something that has become sort of a trade-mark to these romantic comedy films, a la Something About Mary, Meet the Parents but again, I was left feeling a little cheated by fact that this COULD have been a much better film with a little more music and punchier punch lines
Indian Summer is a warm, multi-character film, that would make a fine afternoon film (with a bit of editing)
<br /><br />The film begins in the past with a group of children being shown a moose, which sets the tone perfectly before cutting into the present, when a group of adults from the "golden age" of the camp are invited back again to spend a few weeks holiday by the head of the camp, Uncle Lou
The film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times at the camp, and form new memories in their latest stay
<br /><br />The film succeeds in the great way it brings across its characters in this gorgeous setting, and allows them room to develop without having to worry about plot developments
Watching these people reminisce, and their relationships with each other is what the film is all about and why it works so well
It never goes to over the top and melodramatic, always keeping its warmth, charm and realism
I've never seen a film where nostalgia is captured so well, and found myself getting drawn in despite never having been to one of these camps as a child myself
<br /><br />For a warm, nostalgic character movie, I sincerely recommend
Though this movie has a first rate roster of fine actors, special effects that are excellent, and a story line that is full of surprises, it wasn't picked up for studio distribution and went directly to DVD
Perhaps it contains too much 'anti-police force' information, or perhaps it is juts one too many action flicks released during a glut, but whatever the reason the big screens missed the opportunity, fortunately the new concept of releasing direct to DVD allows us to enjoy it
<br /><br />The theme is old: rookie reporter uncovers an inner circle of cops that are corrupt - in this case the F
(First Response Assault and Tactical) team, a group of well trained policeman created to clean up the mythical city of Edison from its low point of crime, drugs, prostitution etc
Working undercover the temptation of pocketing the confiscated goods and money proves too much of an opportunity and now, 15 years after its formation, FRAT is responsible for murder, drug trafficking, terrorizing innocent people etc
The lead dog is Lazerov (Dylan McDermott, who makes a terrifyingly real gangster!) and his partner Rafe Deed (LL Cool J, even more buff than usual and proving he can be a sensitive actor)
Reporter Pollack (Justin Timberlake) catches wind of a 'bad mistake' and reports his theory of fraud and corruption to his paper's boss Ashford (the always reliably fine Morgan Freeman)
Gradually Polack convinces Ashford and subsequently Wallace (Kevin Spacey, also a consistently fine character actor) and they aid Pollack in this investigative reporting
The closer Pollack gets to the truth the more surprises and bad incidents happen and the story runs pall mall toward a series of unexpected results
<br /><br />Timberlake lacks the charisma to carry the lead, especially in the company of such seasoned actors
But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey, and McDermott keep the well-oiled machine of a movie rolling to the very end
No, it is not a great movie, but it is one that makes for an edge of the seat action flick with a message
It's just such a joy to have watched this intriguing project
Not only to a filmmaker, who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minutes of screen time, but also as audience, who may not be so ready for so much love in such short time
<br /><br />20 short films about love in Paris are all unique, but some of them, as expected, stand out
I thought the Tom Tykwer (Natalie Portman) segment was the best, although the mimes made me smile inside just the same
<br /><br />I clicked on "spoilers" option for this review bus alas
Don't read what I write, but watch the movie instead
The first thing you meet when you study fascism is ostracism:because this" philosophy " is a fake one,there's a need to use scapegoats to assess the "thought"
Ettore Scola's movie,probably his masterpiece, focuses on the outcasts,the scapegoats of the regime
<br /><br />Of the historical event (Hitler and Mussolini's alliance),we will see almost nothing:some military march,some garlands,some scattered voices
Our two heroes are not invited for the feast of virility
"Genius is essentially masculine" :this is the golden rule Antonietta (a never better Sophia Loren)embroidered on her cushion;Antonietta ,whose world amounts to her kitchen,whose pride is her offsprings
At the beginning of the movie,she's a victim of this hypermacho world,but she does not realize it
Gabriel,on the contrary ,is politically aware,he knows about the cancer that is destroying inexorably his country
But as a gay man,he is no longer part of it,he's about to be arrested
<br /><br />Forgetting everything that comes between them,they realize what they have in common and they make love
This is an act of rebellion,particularly for Antonietta ,whose ethic should forbid such a thing
Becoming an adulteress in a land where politics and religion combine to repress women as ever leads her to some kind of political awareness
One of the last shots shows her listening to the news on the radio
<br /><br />Expect the unexpected and maybe a doctrine which denies the human being his intimate personality will see that its days are numbered
I was but a babe in arms when George Lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world Saga chronicling the adventures of young Luke Skywalker and the notorious Darth Vadar but even today 20 years on I can appreciate the genius that is Lucas and the incredible imagination he's been blessed with
In A New Hope Lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky Princess Leia, the Rougish Han Solo and the spirited Luke Skywalker as well as that best loved of villains, the sinister Darth Vadar
In The Empire Strikes Back he went all out to show us Special Effects can add to a tale and managed to something no-one thought you could do on screen
He made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat
Return of the Jedi is a fitting end to a Saga that will stand the test of time
<br /><br />When The Empire Srtikes Back ended with encasing of the lovable Rouge Han Solo in Carbonite to be delivered to Jabba the Hut and young Luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his Father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse
How we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow? In Lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from Han's daring rescue from Jabba's palace to the the final climactic battle on the Death Star between Luke and Vadar as Luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a Jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his Father's soul
<br /><br />Old friends like the smooth talking Lando Calrissian and the ever lovable Chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the Emperor himself ( played by the brilliant Ian McDiarmiud
How he missed out on an Oscar is a mystery
) desperate to turn Luke to the Dark Side even if it means betraying his apprentice Darth Vadar
All in black with his red eyes,ghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed Master of the events that unfold
His new and improved Death Star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the Empire's reign for good
<br /><br />Lucas managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted
We watch in excitement as Han and Leia attempt to bring down the shield around the Death Star from the forest Moon of Endor with the help of some adorable Ewoks ( who I really do not believe take from the movie at all
In fact I feel they provide a sort reprieve from the tension of the battles at and in the Death Star) and hindered by legions of Stormtroopers and Imperial Officers
We cheer on Lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty Imperial Fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the Deatn Star to destroy it once and for all
And we watch with bated breath as Vadar and the Emperor attempt to turn Luke to the Dark Side while he in turn tries to turn his Father back
<br /><br />But for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside Darth Vadar
For ROTJ is a battle of emotions and feelings
Vadar is caught between his loyalty to the Emporer and the Empire and his Fatherly inclinations to Luke
Never did I think that a mask could show emotion but some-how one can't but see the confusion and pain on Vadar's face during the final scenes as the Emporer turns on Luke
There is more depth and emotion to Vadar than I believed a villain, especially one more machine then man could have and that I think is what makes him so accessible
Without ruining the end too much Vadar's final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy
<br /><br />So in conclusion what can I say
Star Wars is the most compelling and engaging Sagas I've seen in a long time and I have yet to see another Saga rival it
Return of the Jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending Lucas masterpiece deserves
It's action, suspense, romance, tragedy, redemption, joy all rolled into one and it's memorable characters, wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that Lucas can be proud of
Poor Ivy: Though to the manner born, she had the bad luck to marry a charming wastrel (Richard Ney)
As the movie is set in the 20s or 30s, when rigid Victorian ideas of class were starting to fray at the edges, this uncertain status vexes her unduly
The Gretorexes (for so they are called) don't know where their next shilling is coming from but there are yachting parties and fancy-dress balls in posh pleasaunces aplenty to tempt her
When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) makes the acquaintance of a wealthy older gent (Herbert Marshall, who must have been born middle-aged), she sets one of her extravant chapeaux for him
Luckily, one of the beaux she still strings along (Patric Knowles) is a physician whose consulting rooms provide a cache of poison, with which she bids her hubby farewell
The fact that it implicates Knowles doesn't phase her a bit, even as the hours trickle by until he should be hanged by the neck until dead
The turning of the plot depends on police inspector Sir Cedric Hardwicke; Knowles' mother (the redoubtable Lucile Watson); and Knowles' loyal housekeeper (Una O'Connor)
Sam Wood adds some subtle touches to this well above average melodrama; Fontaine's luminous face supplies the rest
<br /><br />Just a few ways to describe this movie
Yes, it's slow and it has mostly talking, but the whole story of all of their lives and how it's told with the flashbacks thrown in and out makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this haunting and tragic story
I, myself, am reading the book that the movie is based off of and it has shown me even more light into this story and answers some questions that were left unanswered in the movie
I'm also to read the Exectioner's Song, which is the 'other' half of the Gilmore story
This movie made me think so much about the phrase "piering into the other side of the looking glass"
You hear a song in the movie called Gary Gilmore's Eyes, which is by a punk band that wrote a song about what it'd be like to have Gary Gilmore's eyes(which is one of the things Gary gave as a transplant when he died) and as you listen to it, which is after the last time Mikal ever sees Gary, you look at the whole situation a little differently if you were to only here the song itself
This movie opened my eyes in that way and in many others
I recommend this movie(and the book) very very much
"Secret of the Lens" is perhaps a pretty campy all-time favorite of mine
The best and funniest from Kajawari Yoshiaki, who is known for splatter anime and sleazy hentai-ecchi anime
<br /><br />My favorite scenes are the psychedelic CG sequence, the parts where Lord Helumis blows up his failing henchmen, the party riots that Bill causes (one of the funniest scenes) and whenever my favorite character, Worsle appears
<br /><br />WARNING:This is not for serious sophisticated Anime fans
The plot of the story and the performance of the lead actors are very much down-to-earth! The romance between two teen-age boys on the screen was done in good taste
You can easily relate to their emotions if you are one but if you are not one, you can appreciate the kind of love the film is trying to impart
Sure this was a remake of a 70's film, but it had the suspense and action of a current film, say Breakdown
He's running, desperate to be with his hospitalized wife, the police are the least concern
The chases were very good, the part with him being<br /><br />cornered at a rest stop was well done, the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger
This is better than Bullitt, a boring movie with what, a muscle car chase that was filmed badly? Vigo's character knew what he had to do to escape Johnny Law, few movies had the effects-night vision, CB radio-okay I forgot the name of the movie, guy has 76'Caddy souped up, toys with guy he upset
The ending is great, you can't tell if he fakes his suicide or not, a very good did-he-make-it-or-not
This is an amazing movie and all of the actors and actresses and very good! Even though some of the actors and actresses weren't very popular in show business it seemed like they have been acting since they were 1 one year old! It was funny, gross and just all out a very good movie
In most parts I just didn't know what was going to happen next! I was like I think this is going to happen, wait I think this is going to happen
All age groups will love this movie! In some parts I couldn't stop laughing, it was so funny, but in some parts I was totally grossed out and I couldn't believe what I was seeing! I am definitely going to see this movie again! It is one of those movies where it can't get boring
I definitely recommend seeing this movie!
So many educational films are nothing more than mind-numbing drudgery, saved only by the fact that "MST3K" mocks them ("Why Study Industrial Arts?" comes to mind)
"Hemo the Magnificent" is actually quite well done
It's all about blood, the heart, and the circulatory system
I admit that I don't remember everything from it, but it does a good job explaining everything, keeping it serious but entertaining
I guess that you can always count on June Foray (most famously the voice of Rocky the Squirrel, she plays a deer here)
<br /><br />Since "Hemo the Magnificent" itself may be hard to find, probably the best place to see it is in "Gremlins": a class is watching it while a gremlin is forming
This movie is not great, but it is a good and enjoyable one
It feels like an indie film made out of a play script
Morgan Freeman basically plays himself, although the director swears the script was not written for him
And there is the small irony of the actor that goes in a supermarket to do research for a film that he hasn't committed to yet
I mean, he actually made the film in the end and we are watching it :)<br /><br />I found the dialogue a bit too positive for my taste, but refreshing nonetheless
This is a film that inspires the viewer to take a look at their own lives and choose the direction in which to go
A bit too much emphasis on appearance, if you ask me
<br /><br />Bottom line: a nice little film, made in two weeks, with basically two actors and a few extras, dialogue driven, makes Morgan Freeman look good :
Spectacular Horror movie that will give you the chills once you get settled with it
The atmosphere is very creepy and stylish, the score is chilling, but the best about the movie is it's performances
It's rare to get scared by performances and this movie's solid acting plays an important part in the scare factor
<br /><br />The story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes
Though the woman in black does not have much screen time, she makes the necessary appearances to chill the audience in some brilliant scenes
The dialogs are very descriptive and make your imagination work and that's when it becomes really scary
<br /><br />If you have the chance, watch this on theater it's a totally different experience but as scary as this movie
<br /><br />This is one of the best Ghost movies ever and it's directed for people that want to get scared
It's not too bad a b movie, with Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Willie Best we could be either with Charlie Chan, Moto, the Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or the Saint etc
In other words you get the chance to spend another hour in the company of some old friends, from plain to urbane, murdering and being murdered - always a pleasure in my book
<br /><br />Barrie's a hard-boiled dame out to avenge and clear her framed and dead father, a police detective by planning and carrying out with her coterie a string of underworld assassinations
Which would surely have had the opposite effect! Sanders joins in the fun simply by dancing in the right club in the right place in the right city at the right time with the right lighting falling on both him and the first killer (at the right time!) and killing him
<br /><br />The story and acting's OK, the only gripe I've got is near the end with the hurried and almost laughable discovery of who the evil genius (Waldeman) was - did they almost forget about his relevance in the plot? That said, a solid entry in the series
This period melodrama is one of Griffith's earliest claustrophobic films
Characters trapped within a room are prevalent throughout his work and, as time went by, he would become increasingly adept at portraying their helplessness and involving the audience in their terror
In the bluntly titled Sealed Room there is one major difference to the normal plot line, in that there truly is no escape
<br /><br />Griffith achieves the claustrophobic effect here in two ways
While the typical Biograph short might utilise a dozen or more sets, The Sealed Room features only two adjoining rooms  the king's court and the dove cote that becomes the eponymous tomb
The set design in these shorts is rarely referenced, but here it is crucial
The court is a large interior, with a backdrop hinting at greater depth and showing us a window and a staircase
Actors enter and leave from various directions, suggesting the room is not only spacious but also free and open
By contrast the dove cote's back wall is very close to the camera, and the angles in it suggesting a hexagonal or octagonal shape make it seem even more confined
<br /><br />The second technique on display here is the cross-cutting
Anyone with an interest in Griffith's work will probably know about his heavy use and development of cross-cutting to build excitement or tension
Many will also know that strictly speaking it wasn't his invention
However what makes Griffith's cross-cuts so effective is the way he paces the opposing images so they complement each other
The Sealed Room contains a good example of what I mean
The shots of the masons shifting the heavy bricks have a slow, step-by-step pace to them, with tension building as the wall gets higher
This movement is matched by the shots of the blissfully unaware lovers, in which Marion Leonard tears off flower petals one-by-one
As the couple realise their predicament, their rising panic is complemented by the opposing shot of the king madly thrashing his sword against the wall
<br /><br />At this point, Griffith was yet to realise that the action could be heightened further by introducing a third strand to the cross-cut
The dramatic "ride-to-the-rescue", here absent, was later to become a standard climax to Griffith's pictures
This is what I was expecting when star trek DS9 premiered
That was a wonderful show in it's own right, however it never really gave the fans more of what they wanted
While having a similarity to the original trek it differs enough to be original in it's own ways
It makes the ideas of exploration exciting to us again
And that was one of the primary ingredients that made the original so loved
Another ingredient to success was the relationships that evolved between the crew members
Enterprise has much promise in this area as well
The chemistry between Bakula and Blalock seems very promising
While sexual tension in a show can often become a crutch, I feel the tensions on enterprise can lead to much more and say alot more than is typical
I think when we deal with such grand scale characters of different races or species even, we get some very interesting ideas and television
Also, we should note the performances, Blalock is very convincing as Vulcan T'pol and Bacula really has a whimsy and strength of character that delivers a great performance
The rest of the cast delivered good performances also
It's good it's different, but a little to light hearted for my liking
Maybe something with a little more electronic sound would suffice
They could fix this by selling less ads, or making all shows two parters
Otherwise we'll end up seeing the shows final act getting wrapped up way too quickly as was one of my complaints of Voyager
Kim (Patricia Clarkson), George (Jake Weber) and son Miles (Erik Per Sullivan) are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from Manhattan's bustling metropolis
On the way, they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow
A group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along
Rather than helping, at least one of the hunters, Otis (John Speredakos), is mad because the accident cracked the buck's antlers
George, Kim and Miles are disturbed by Otis, and even worse, we quickly learn that Otis has learned where they're staying
Meanwhile, Miles is given a wendigo (a kind of Indian shape-shifting spirit/monster) token by an Indian whom only he has seen
Is Otis a psycho out to get our heroes? Are there wendigos in the woods? <br /><br />I can see where Wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers
It is a fairly low budget film, with technical limitations frequently showing through
Much of the film, and maybe all of it, is not really about the titular creature
And perhaps the fatal blow for many people, it has a very ambiguous ending, with a number of questions left unanswered
If you are discouraged by such endings, and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant, do yourself a favor and avoid Wendigo
<br /><br />Personally, I like films like that
The marketing of Wendigo is geared towards those who want a quick, scary creature flick, where they'd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end, and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for Wendigo 2: The Monster Returns, but that's not what this film is
Wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people
Heck, writer/director Larry Fessenden even has a character, George, reciting Robert Frost
The Frost poem, and George's comment that Frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things, is the key to the film
<br /><br />One of the best things about the film is its complexity
In a way, there are four different films occurring at the same time, a thread from each character
In George's thread, he isn't exactly the happiest or most pleasant guy in the world, and he has some parenting problems
For him, the film is a realistic, horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse
In Patricia's thread, she's looking for rejuvenation of her life and family
She's a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her, hoping that they'll go away and get better
In Otis' thread, he's even more down on his luck than George, and George's arrival into his life symbolizes the final "crack" in his psychological armor
And in Miles' thread, which is probably the most important of the film, life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world
But this is a horror story, after all, albeit one with a glimmer of hope, and the events in the film give Miles' poetic interpretations a dark turn
Still, when everything is said and done, he seems to be the only one retaining his composure, due to the poetic outlook
<br /><br />Even though the film is low budget, there are a lot of well-executed higher budget ambitions
Fessenden and director of photography Terry Stacey find some great shots in beautiful locations, and created some interesting slide show like montages (such as the cards, or the Indian wendigo images from the book)
There are also interesting more traditional montages, such as Miles' nightmare
Wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films
<br /><br />Other technical aspects are good for the budget
The "Wendigo" appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous
The lighting was usually good--there were a few times that dark scenes weren't as clear as they could have been, but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock (it could have been digital instead) or transfer
I thought the performances were good and far more realistic (if you value that) than the majority of films
Although I didn't really notice the score, it must have been okay, or I would have noticed it with a negative judgment
<br /><br />Overall, Wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without preconceptions, as long as you don't mind having to think about the movies you watch
Sadly not available on DVD as yet, but worth pursuing on TCM or VHS
A secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder, and courageously takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth
A movie with many twists and dark alleyways, none of which I will mention! The jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer, is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, despite being at very low budget and made during WWII in black and white
Despite the low budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of original style and outstanding vision
Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew much about these matters, casting the feistiest women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - of their era
Robert Siodmak was of one of several German, Hungarian & Czech film-makers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz,Lang, etc - who émigrés relocated to Hollywood, and brought a highly original fresh vision with them
Sadly Ella Raines was never given such a great part again, and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns
This show was absolutely great, and I always look forward to watching it
All the characters were funny and awesome in their own way, each and every episode provided non-stop laughter, and it was completely entertaining and different from a lot of other shows
Everybody was just absolutely insane and breathtakingly funny, that you couldn't help but love this show
There were a few dead weight episodes, but That '70s Show always managed to create some kind of likable atmosphere, to where it just really didn't matter
This was one of the best shows to ever be aired, and I will watch this show anytime I can, for it never gets old, never gets unfunny, and never gets uninteresting
Very good drama about a young girl who attempts to unravel a series of horrible crimes
She enlists the aid of a police cadet, and they begin running down a series of clues which lead to a traveling carny worker with a long police record
An ending which is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat
Clint Eastwood would star again as the battle-weary Detective Harry Callahan, but would also direct the fourth entry in the 'Dirty Harry' series
'Sudden Impact' again like the other additions, brings its own distinguishable style and tone, but if anything it's probably the most similar to the original in it's darker and seedy moments (and bestowing a classic line "Go ahead
Make my day") but some of its humor has to been seen to believe
A bulldog named meathead that pisses and farts
However an interesting fact this entry was only one in series to not have it set entirely in San Francisco
<br /><br />The story follows that of detective Callahan trying to put the pieces together of a murder where the victim was shot in the groin and then between the eyes
After getting in some trouble with office superiors and causing a stir which has some crime lord thugs after his blood
He's ordered to take leave, but it falls into a working one where he heads to a coastal town San Paulo, where a murder has occurred similar in vein (bullet to groin and between eyes) to his case
There he begins to dig up dirt, which leads to the idea of someone looking for revenge
<br /><br />To be honest, I wasn't all that crash hot on Eastwood's take, but after many repeat viewings it virtually has grown on me to the point of probably being on par with the first sequel 'Magnum Force'
This well-assembled plot actually gives Eastwood another angle to work upon (even though it feels more like a sophisticated take on the vigilante features running rampant at that time), quite literal with something punishing but luridly damaging
It's like he's experimenting with noir-thriller touches with character-driven traits to help develop the emotionally bubbling and eventual morality framework
His use of images is lasting, due to its slickly foreboding atmospherics
Dark tones, brooding lighting like the scene towards the end akin to some western showdown of a silhouette figure (Harry with his new
44 automag handgun) moving its way towards the stunned prey on the fishing docks
It's a striking sight that builds fear! Mixing the hauntingly cold with plain brutality and dash of humor
A major plus with these films are the dialogues, while I wouldn't call 'Sudden Impact' first-rate, it provides ample biting exchanges and memorably creditable lines "You're a legend in your own mind"
Don't you just love hearing Harry sparking an amusing quip, before pulling out his piece
The beating action when it occurs is excitingly jarring and intense the only way to go and the pacing flies by with little in the way of flat passages
Lalo Schfrin would return as composer (after 'The Enforcer" had Jerry Fielding scoring) bringing a methodical funky kick, which still breathed those gloomy cues to a texturally breezy score that clicked from the get-go
Bruce Surtees (an Eastwood regular) gets the job behind the camera (where he did a piecing job with 'Dirty Harry') and gives the film plenty of scope by wonderfully framing the backdrops in some impeccable tracking scenes, but also instrument edgy angles within those dramatic moments
<br /><br />Eastwood as the dinosaur Callahan still packs a punch, going beyond just that steely glare to get the job done and probably showing a little more heart than one would expect from a younger Callahan
This going by the sudden shift in a plot turn of Harry's quest for justice by the badge even though he doesn't always agree with it
I just found it odd a real change of heart
Across from him is a stupendous performance by his beau at the time Sondra Locke
Her turn of traumatic torment (being senselessly raped along with her younger sister), is hidden by a glassily quiet intensity
When the anger is released, it's tactically accurate in its outcome
Paul Drake is perfectly menacing and filthy as one of the targeted thugs and Audrie J
Neenan nails down a repellently scummy and big-mouthed performance
These people are truly an ugly bunch of saps
Pat Hingle is sturdy as the Chief of the small coastal town
In smaller parts are Bradford Dillman and the agreeably potent Albert Popwell (a regular in the series 1-4, but under different characters)
How can you forget him in 'Dirty Harry' yes he is bank robber that's at the end of the trademark quote "Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?
It was Susanah York's Birthday and they were showing this film as a double feature with Tom Jones (1963)
I took interest in seeing this film because one of the stars is the very funny and talented Jim Dale, as Lusty the sailor
I believe that Dale now does the narration of the Harry Potter books on Casette, but anyway he is quite funny
Columbia Pictures should go through their film collection, and consider restoring and releasing this film to DVD
Christopher Plummer is hilarious as Lord Fopington, Ian Bannen is also quite humorous as Ramble the sailor
This is a bawdy comedy, the kind of film one no longer sees, with great production values
It takes place in a Bolivia, there the guerillas are sick and wary and don't meet that much sympathy from the farmers
If you know your 60s history, you understand how it ends
You will understand it even without that knowledge
<br /><br />Del Toro is once again splendid
He goes on building this icon about the revolutionary who remains the same, regardless of success or failure
That's what Guevara is according to the legend, but still it's so well acted
<br /><br />The documentary feeling is there around the icon, which is one of the greatest achievements in this big Soderbergh project
A woody7739) i Love the film Twisted Desire, And i love watching Melissa Joan Hart on the t
I am a real fan of sabrina the teenage witch too, so this helped my watch it (don't ask)
i love the way that nicole plans out her parents murder very carfully, as she makes sure that someone else pulls the trigger and practices on the bottles, so she wont give away her fingerprints (a very well planned out idea), back i guess it all backfired on nicole as she got caught as her old boyfriend comes along and puts a hidden camera under his shirt
i give this film a nine out of ten, and put it in MY top 10 films list
And last but not least if anyone see's this film in the shops please tell me as i seen it on tv and didn't record it
Shower keeps within itself in so many ways
Almost all of the movie takes place in an old- time bathhouse, with the denizens supplying the humor, pathos, and emotional touches
The love and friendship between the proprietor and his retarded son is deep and moving
The way the older brother is drawn into this tiny world seems unforced and persuasive
The plot is meandering, full of surprises and ironies, and touched overall by a sense of what I'd have to call neighborliness in the relations and conflicts of the performers
This is a film I pull out when I want to believe in the world again
Although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that weren't exactly true to character, this was Classic H:LOTS
The characters, outside of Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito), were true to form, and the reunion scenes of Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen
<br /><br />"Homicide: The Movie" aka "Life Everlasting" is a fan flick, but stands on its own as well as any 2-hour episode of the series
Fontana, Overmeyer and Yoshimura did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of "the best damn show on television" together for the series finale that NBC never bothered to give it
True to "Homicide" form, there were no happy endings, such is life
That's what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie-cutter cop shows left on television
Kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike
<br /><br />** I call myself a "Homicidal Maniac" if for no other reason than to keep my co-workers in a cooperative mood
Walt Disney's "The Rookie" is based on the story of Jim Morris, a former minor league picher who made one of the most amazing comebacks in sports history, ending an almost 10 year retirement and making his Major League debut in 1999 at the age of 35
<br /><br />The film opens with a brief synopsis of Morris' childhood, which included a series of re-locations - his father was a military man
And even when his family settled for good in football crazed Texas, Morris' passion for baseball remained strong
<br /><br />The childhood segment then jumps ahead about 23 years to the adult Morris (played by Dennis Quaid) who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at Big Lake High School (in real life it was Reagan County High School in Big Lake, Texas)
It is mentioned that he attempted a career as a baseball player but that it didn't work out
<br /><br />Morris's team is struggling and he lectures them about giving up on their dreams
They turn the table on him, telling him that he should try out for a Major League team
At several times when he pitches to them in practice, they express amazement at the speed with which he throws
Morris seems unconvinced but agrees to a deal with his players in which if they win district, he will try out for a Major League team
<br /><br />Big Lake does win district and, adhering to his end of the deal, Morris attends a Tampa Bay Devil Rays try out
Phenomenally, he throws 98 miles an hour - faster than he threw during his minor league career and an outstanding speed even for a Major League pitcher
After another try out with the team, Morris is offered a contract with the Devil Rays
<br /><br />This leaves him with a tough decision - stay in his comfortable life or once again pursue his Major League dream by going through the minor league grind of making little money and spending months at a time away from home
And the decision is even more agonizing than during his first minor league stint because he now has a wife and three children
<br /><br />Morris signs with the Devil Rays, begins at the AA level and moves up quickly to the AAA level, one level below Major League Baseball
But as the season winds down, the chances of him getting "called up" grow increasingly slim
<br /><br />For the most part, I love this movie
There are lots of great performances and likable characters and it's easy to find yourself really pulling for Morris
Also, the movie does a great job portraying professional baseball at both the major and minor league levels
And most of all, it teaches the timeless message of holding tight to your dreams even when they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve
<br /><br />Still, the movie has some flaws
While generally accurate, it exaggerates and even fabricates a few things
Also, except for one scene in which he prays with his players, the movie completely ignores Morris' Christian faith
But considering Disney's left wing zeal, that's not surprising
<br /><br />Presumably, a lot of the exaggerations/fabrications were done to make the story more dramatic
Yet the 20 minute documentary on Morris that is included on the DVD features some information that makes his story more dramatic but is excluded from the movie
<br /><br />For example, from birth until his family settled in Texas for good when he was 12, Morris re-located 14 times
And his initial minor league career ended after four surgeries through which he lost half of the muscle in his left (pitching) shoulder, thus making his throwing 98 mph even more inexplicable
<br /><br />To fully appreciate and understand the story of Jim Morris, it's good to not only watch "The Rookie" but to watch the DVD's documentary, check out the aforementioned link to the movie's inaccuracies and probably also to read Morris' biography, also titled "The Rookie
" I haven't read the book but I hope to one of these days
<br /><br />But overall, "The Rookie" is a very good portrayal of a miraculous story and is a powerful testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man
I came across An Insomniac's Nightmare while looking for offbeat independent films, and glad to say it did NOT disappoint
This crazy half hour ride had me wondering all the way through, and the ending was excellent - one of those NOOOOO moments that really stays with you
I've shown it to a number of people and everyone seems to agree hands down
The little ghostie girl was very talented and I think her performance stole the show
She creeped the heck out of me, I can say that much
Nanavati did a great job putting this short together
All the pieces just fell into place and you can tell that she's a great writer from what she did with this script
It's undoubtedly the strongest part of the film
The directing was great and the acting was enjoyable, but the most important factor here is the strength of the screenplay
Good job to this girl, I can't wait to see more
A Matter of Life and Death, what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film
Powell and Pressburger's visual imagination knows no bounds, every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions
The switches between the bold colours of "the real world" to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious, showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is
The final court scene is also fantastic, as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over Peter (David Niven)'s operation
<br /><br />All of the performances are spot on (Roger Livesey being a standout), and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful, never has there been a more romantic film than this (if there has I haven't seen it)
A Matter of Life and Death is all about the power of love and just how important life is
And Jack Cardiff's cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone, the way he lights Kim Hunter's face makes her all the more beautiful, what a genius, he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting
And the sound design is also impeccable; the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its time<br /><br />This is a true classic that can restore anyone's faith in cinema, under appreciated on its initial release and by today's audiences, but one of my all time favourites, which is why I give this film a 10/10, in a word - Beautiful
I wouldn't dare say this film is better than the original, but it is very good in it's own right
The comedy in this film is just as good as the original though, there are so many scenes that get me laughing just thinking about them
<br /><br />The story in this film is even more bizarre than the original, but that's what makes it so great
Peter Hewitt does a great job directing this film with a great cast
The core cast from the original film returns to their characters in this film and all do a fantastic job with their roles
I don't care what anyone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor! I really enjoyed his portrayal of Ted in both of these films as I did Alex Winter's Bill
I was very happy to see George Carlin returning to the role of Rufus, very cool! Hal London Jr, who plays the part of Ted Logan's father does a really good job
The scene where Ted possesses his fathers body and Hal London Jr begins acting like Ted is a great scene, and he pulls it off impressively well
I can't forget to mention William Sadler as Death, he completely made the movie for me
The rest of the cast is quite good as well
<br /><br />If you liked the first installment of the Bill and Ted series, then I would hope you would like this film as well
But, don't expect it to be as good as the original
I really hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,<br /><br />-Chri
I recently stumbled across this film on TNT five minutes into it, while on vacation in Florida
(hey there has to be some down time in the hotel, right?) I was initially surprised to see Melissa Joan Hart in any feature length film on TNT
I mean "Drive Me Crazy" isn't THAT old already, is it?<br /><br />But I stuck with it, and was thoroughly surprised and entertained
Melissa plays her role as the psychotic Jennifer excellently
The supporting cast (Nick, the ex-con boyfriend; Karen, her best friend; and her life-controlling parents) all added a great degree of believability
The twist at the end was a nice closure to this tale of the girl who always seemed to be one step ahead of everybody
<br /><br />If you get a chance, check it out!<br /><br /
The best of the seven Sam Fuller movies that I've seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten!, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One, and this film), Pickup on South Street counts as one of the best film noirs
It represents Fuller at his most controlled
I like him when he's out of control, of course, but nearly everything in Pickup is perfect
Richard Widmark stars as a pickpocket who steals some microfilm that was meant to go to communist spies
Jean Peters plays the woman who was carrying the film for her boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley
Peters is forced to find Widmark and get it back
She finds him through a stool pigeon played by Thelma Ritter
Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which changes Peters loyalties (that, and the fact that she learns she's working for communists; the Cold War stuff is really interesting)
The love story is done a little quickly and not entirely believable, but it's not so bad that it harms the film (unlike Fuller's previous film, Park Row)
This must be one of his best roles, but I'm not so familiar with his career that I can say that for sure
Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable performance
Her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance, and her final scene in this film is as touching as any you will find in the cinema
Super Speedway makes a great demo of your new DVD / bigscreen / 5
The IMAX camera puts you right in the race car, where you cruise around various tracks at high speed, reminiscent of the driving sequences in Grand Prix (if only that would appear on DVD!)
<br /><br />The only minus, and why I didn't give it a 10, is some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the film was speeded up
The soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief - all you can hear in a real car is the engine
You won't hear swooshes as you go under bridges
I remember seeing this film years ago on, I think, BBC2
I would very much like to view it again - does anyone know how I can obtain a copy? As I remember, it was an especially powerful movie, in particular the scene that stands out is of the horses wearing gas masks
Apart from that I really can't recall too much about the story - which is why I want to view it again! I have trawled the web but am unable to find a copy, which is unusual in my experience - perhaps there is no DVD or VHS of this film on the market
Would appreciate any help anyone can give me on this
Thanks very much in advance for your assistance
As well as showing actual footage of key events in the failed coup to oust Chavez, we are given the background picture which describes a class-divided society
Many of the rich, it appears, have a choice with the people's democratic choice, and are willing to use the military for regime change
'Be careful what you say in front of your servants' is a revealing comment
The head of the country's biggest oil company appoints himself as the new president, with US backing, and these young Irish film makers have it all on camera
A great film to educate young people about democracy
We see transparent documentation of how media can be manipulated, and force used, in the interests of big business, against the interests of the democratic wishes of the people
i found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way! i felt that the script was conveying all the things i feel physically and emotionally when i got home from work and watched, it
this is a tribute to cinema in the highest form and format
<br /><br />holy guacamole! how i wish those days would come again
i tried putting a bubble window on the side of my car (honda civic 1984), but the vacuum formed muffin trays didn't quite cut it
also in my civic, sexual positions are limited and are not supported by water bed as is brilliantly depicted in 'the van'
<br /><br />'the van' is of the utmost side splitting hilarity and can even substitute for porn if you watch some scenes privately
<br /><br />i highly anticipate that Sam Grossman (the director) has achieved his opus
<br /><br />Ratings john: ****1/2 Sam: ****
The movie was gripping from start to finish and its b/w photography of the American heartland is stunning
We feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into Mexico and back to America again
Near the end of the movie, the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face
In the end, we follow them up the stairway to their final moment
<br /><br />The two criminals, performed by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock could be seen on any street in any town
Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith, the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town
This point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else
Evil, even the most vile, is part of the human condition
These two delusional men kill an entire family, looking for a safe that isn't there
Once on the run, they start writing bad cheques, carving out a trail for the authorities
<br /><br />There are many fine supporting actors
I like John Forsyth as the detective on the case, Alvin Dewey
Also, Will Geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorney
<br /><br />I have often wanted to see this movie all the way through, having only caught it in short snatches; I did finally get to it after buying the DVD
The result is the finest classic crime movie I have ever seen
<br /><br />Don't miss this brilliant movie
To me, this is what great film-making is all about
But if you like the muppets I defy you to dislike this one
Basically the same plot regurgitated (this time New York, not LA) it features a lot of fun cameos and muppet hi-jinx
A lot of the muppets leave the film pretty early on as it centers around Kermy and Miss Piggy
Why can't more directors these days create horror movies like "The Shining"? There's an easy answer to that: modern day directors are not Stanley Kubrick
Kubrick proved once-and-for-all with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and auteurs of all time
<br /><br />So, the plot is fairly simple
A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson)and his family move into a large, secluded hotel to watch over it for the off-season
The kicker is that the previous caretaker of the hotel savagely murdered his wife and two girls
What follows can most readily be summed by the title of the movie, but you have to watch it to see what I mean
<br /><br />This is the first movie in a very long time to strike me as "scary"
It's some seriously messed up stuff, but in a good way
One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music
Music has been a major part of Kubrick's movies (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and he definitely doesn't disappoint with this one
The score completely sets the tone and this film would not be the same without it
<br /><br />Finally, I must comment on Nicholson's legendary performance
Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer
In fact, just his stare steals a few scenes of this movie
This is top-notch acting that must be seen to believe
<br /><br />There will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one
I first saw this movie years ago and have continued to view it several times a year when I have an opportunity
It is on my list of favorite movies along with some of the classics
Should anyone tell you it is foolish or outdated, ignore them
this movie is for anyone who enjoys laughing and music
The dancing isn't as important in this film as in other Astaire movies so the comedy and acting shine through
See this movie if you can, it may be light but it is still completely amusing
So I know that many people hate black and white films, they think old movies can't really be funny, this movie should make them change their minds
No one I know can watch this movie without being at least mildly amused
The only problem with the film: Fred Astaire singing without dancing
He may be a great performer and capable singer but it just isn't fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story
The comedy gets a bit cliché at times but the vaudevillesque performances of G burns and G Allen are just perfect for the piece and can satisfy anyone looking for some easy laughs
Give this film a chance even if you don't like old movies, this movie can appeal to the ridiculous in any one
Even if it wasn't based on real life, Forbidden Lies was a fascinating portrait of a con artist in her element
And it is the kind of film psychology students could study to learn about compulsive liars
<br /><br />The author of Forbidden Love, Norma, was revealed as a fraud in the media but this move really does give her ample opportunity to clear her name
<br /><br />But the twists and turns she takes the documentary maker through are amazing
I have not read the book but simply heard good reviews and went to see it on boring rainy afternoon
The journey this film takes you on is clever, interesting and totally engrossing
I think Hollow Point is a funny film with some good moments I have never seen before in action movies
Well,both Tia Carrere and Thomas Ian Griffith aren't so good in acting, but Tia Carrere is nice and good looking girl, isn't it? But Donald Sutherland is superb in his role so-so mad gangster
I have seen this movie more than several times, on TV
This movie is full of chilling surprises, and absolutely edge-of-your-seat suspenseful, without being overbearing or stupid
Helen Hunt's talent is magnificently shown in this movie! I recommend this movie to anyone!!
I had heard good things about this film and was, you guessed it, a bit disappointed
Reese Witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good, surprisingly confident, at a young age; really all the (small) cast are quite solid, in their simple 50s American setting
The reason I didn't rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end, the grief shown by the older sister didn't seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit
Perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot, or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer
Maureen's character is quite underdeveloped I think
, the younger) would be traumatised and angry, but why is her sister shown to be more upset? Because she's a few years older? Hasn't the end rather undermined the rest of the film? The pacing of the movie makes it seem that Maureen and Court have only just met, when he gets tractored (warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal, in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit
It depends what you want - if you want the girls' happy story of young love that it seems like you're going to get, you're in for a surprise
Man in the Moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film  a rather awkward combination? I liked the character of Court though, I can see what girls watching this might be watching
And I loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister (most men would, most films wouldn't) and get killed
<br /><br />7/10 on my pretty harsh ratings scale
For some reason I found Jason London on a tractor funny
Whenever I hear a movie being touted because it has no sex, violence, bad language, special effects, and so on, my b
Usually, a movie like that is sentimental hogwash which panders to people who don't want anything to surprise them, but to affirm how superior they are to us craven folk
So when David Lynch's THE STRAIGHT STORY began getting those kinds of reviews, I was apprehensive, especially since I was not a fan of his other "uplifting" story, THE ELEPHANT MAN
For all the stunning images and the good acting in that film, it seemed more interested in preaching to us than inspiring us
THE STRAIGHT STORY is an honest movie rather than a saccharine one
Most of that is due to the fact that Lynch and writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney tell it straight and simple for the most part
There are a couple of homilies by Straight I could have done without, and the shots of grain being harvested are repeated a little too much, but those are only quibbles
There's no heavy-handed message, no sentimental strings to jerk our emotions, and no condescension towards us and its characters
Instead, they depend on the story to build its own power, and it does, so by the final scene, we are genuinely moved
<br /><br />Of course, casting Richard Farnsworth adds realism to the part
He really is someone who looks like he's lived through a lot but still perseveres, and except for those homilies, the desire he has to get back together with his brother doesn't seem overly sentimental, because you can sense here is someone who's lived too long and seen too much to be driven by anger for long
And he knows his time is running out, so he wants to make some peace, not only with his brother, but with his life
Sissy Spacek also does fine, unmannered work as Straight's daughter
And although I am a city and suburban boy, the Iowa and Wisconsin landscape are beautifully shot, making me want at least to visit some day
Where the Sidewalk Ends is quite a good film-noir crime drama and is shot well in black and white and on location as well
<br /><br />A copper accidentally kills a bloke who is suspected of murder and to protect himself, he covers this up and blames it on another person he doesn't like who has committed a lot of crimes in the past
But towards the end, he owns up but not before falling in love with a woman he meets who is the lover of the person he killed
<br /><br />The cast includes Dana Andrews (While the City Sleeps, Curse of the Demon), Gene Tierney (Laura, The Ghost and Mrs Muir), Gary Merrill (Mysterious Island), Karl Malden (The Streets of San Francisco, Beyond the Posidon Adventure) and Craig Stevens (The Deadly Mantis)
<br /><br />Where the Sidewalk Ends is worth checking out if you get the chance
In his otherwise excellent book, Lincoln in American Memory, the historian Merrill Peterson calls Young Mr
This amazingly wrongheaded analysis simply proves that great historians are rarely fine film critics
I am working on a doctoral dissertation on Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass
As part of my preparation for writing the dissertation, I made a careful analysis of this film, and of Tag Gallaghers brilliant interpretation of it in his seminal book on Ford
Lincoln comes out that culminating year of the first phase of Ford's cinematic authorship, 1939
In that greatest of Hollywood years, Ford directed three superb, still not fully appreciated films: Drums Along the Mohawk, Stagecoach,and Young Mr
It might seem odd to say that Stagecoach is not fully appreciated, all but the most purblind of critics must perceive that it is one of of the greatest Westerns, and perhaps even one of the hundred greatest films of all time
However, what is NOT fully appreciated is that these three films work together as a kind of trilogy-a triptych, in fact
Ford is creating a sort of mythic history of America on screen
Drums Along the Mohawk is the Revolutionary War
Finally, Stagecoach is Post Civil War America
What the three films have in common is that they are an extended meditation on the American Adam and his "errand into the Wilderness"
What are the Psychic and social costs of American manifest destiny, as America strives to build a new human city in the wilderness?Lincoln symbolizes Americas journey, as he seeks to reconcile the civilizational inmpulse (law), with the freedom of the wilderness
Lincoln is not history, ( It is full of historical "howlers'-as both Ford and Trotti were well aware), but myth
This is Lincoln, the symbol of justice and mercy, Lincoln, the man of the wilderness, striving to found a civilization within himself, and to become the "remarkable lawgiver' of young America
Lincoln is not history-like James Agee's long forgotten teleplay about Lincoln, and like Sandburgs biography, it is an epic poem
This oddity from Roman Polanski clearly shows where his preoccupations lay at the time he made it
Polanski himself plays a timid man who rents a Parisian apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide
He becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it, to the point that he's dressing in drag and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded
The movie's unsettling to a point, and it has that atmosphere of creepy dread that Polanski excels at, but it comes off too much as a rehash of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Repulsion," two other better Polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments
unless I'm reading too much into the film, I have to believe that this was Polanksi's reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt at being labeled a sexual pervert and exiled from America
Not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself
"The Notorious Bettie Page" (2005) <br /><br />Directed By: Mary Harron <br /><br />Starring: Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson, & David Strathairn <br /><br />MPAA Rating: "R" (for nudity, sexual content and some language) <br /><br />It seems as though every celebrity nowadays is getting a biopic made about his or her life
From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, biopics are very posh right now
"The Notorious Bettie Page" is the latest of these to be released on DVD
It features Gretchen Mol as the world's most famous pin-up model, Bettie Page and was filmed mostly in black and white with certain excerpts in color
Unlike "Ray", "Walk the Line", and "Finding Neverland", however, this movie is not going to be one to watch out for at the Oscars this year
This movie lacks the emotional resonance displayed in other biopics and most of the more dramatic moments in Bettie Page's life are either completely ignored or only merely suggested
This does not mean, however, that it is a bad movie
In fact, "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling movie--a solid work of cinema
This film focuses more on Page's exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography
It is filmed with fervor and care and Mary Harron's direction captures the look and feel of the time period as most filmmakers only dream about
<br /><br />Everyone knows Bettie Page (played by Mol)
Whether you know her as an iconor a simple porn staryou know her
She is a woman who had a very profound impact on American culture only by revealing more skin than deemed appropriate at that particular time
Now, most people know her as one of America's first sex symbols--a legend to many models, especially those of Playboy and other adult-oriented magazines
She lived in a time when showing just an inch of flesh below the waste could have someone arrested and Page's bondage-style photos were just the thing to push the American public into an uproar
In fact, the photos launched a full-fledged senate investigation about common decency and the difference between harmless films and porn
<br /><br />The performances in "The Notorious Bettie Page" are absolutely wonderful with Gretchen Mol standing out
Her performance as Bettie Page is simply brilliant
I understand that, when she was announced for the role, many people were skeptical
Her name is not one that immediately leaps to my mind when I think of great performances
She completely aced the role and drew me in with her vulnerable and yet deeply engaging performance
David Strathairn is fresh off of last year's "Good Night, and Good Luck", in which he gave one of 2005's best performances
Here, he gives yet another fine performanceeven though he is slightly underused
I was shocked at how very limited his screen time wasbut quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie
The only performance I have seen from Lili Taylor was that in "The Haunting" (1999)
While most people ignored the movie, I found it to be an enjoyable, if not completely shallow, horror movie and I also have always thought that Taylor was perfectly credible as the emotionally-distraught Nell
Here, Taylor gives yet another credible performance
She gives a very subdued performance and delivers the perfect performance to compliment that of Gretchen Mol
<br /><br />After everything was said and done, I realized that "The Notorious Bettie Page" cannot be compared to other biopics, such as "Finding Neverland" and "Walk the Line"
It is incomparable to these because it tells a story of a woman and her career, from the beginning to the end
Her personal life is briefly implied, but it is really her impact on the world that becomes the high point
We watch the film knowing that Page will eventually bare all and we know the impact that her decisions will havebut we are rarely shown the impact that they will have on her personal life
She is a woman that never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself
After all, she was an adult model turned Christian missionary
This movie does not over dramatize anything
It could have included fictitious moments of Page sobbing hysterically and begging God to forgive her
It could have shown Page running and screaming through the rain, trying to escape the ghosts of her pastand yet it does not
"The Notorious Bettie Page" tells a simple story and that is something rare by today's standards
<br /><br />Final Thought: "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a relaxing movie with absolutely amazing cinematography
it beautifully analyzes Italian petty bourgeois society, how the leftists of the 70s have given up all their ideals and come to a happy arrangement which they don't want disturbed
For instance, the aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son, and doesn't want to be reminded of his more radical youth
<br /><br />For a long time wanted to buy the video after having seen the movie a couple of times on the big screen and on TV, but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market, even in Italy no one in the book shops knew about the film
<br /><br />The one sex scene, which everyone seems to go on about, does the film no harm
this is the best sci-fi that I have seen in my 29 years of watching sci-fi
I also believe that Dark Angel will become a cult favorite
The action is great but Jessica Alba is the best and most gorgeous star on TV today
In this send-up of horror films, 50's cold war paranoia, Reagan-era America, and high school films, Adam Arkin plays Tony, the star quarterback of Full Moon High in the 1950's
He and his father (Ed McMahon) travel to communist Romania and while he's lost in the streets one night, he is bitten by a werewolf
When he returns stateside, he cannot control his animalistic urges and goes on a killing spree
Decades later, the immortal Tony returns to town and re-enrolls in highschool
He still can't control his transformations, and the townspeople, and his friends, realize he's not quite human
It all culminates during the schools big football game
<br /><br />I expected this to be one of those 'so bad it's good' films from the early 80's
But I was surprised that the film was actually, legitimately funny
The cast, including Kenneth Mars as a pervy coach, Roz Kelly as Tony's lusty former flame, Demond Wilson as a bus driver, and Alan Arkin as a oddball doctor, go all out, with hilarious results
<br /><br />While watching this film I was struck by how similar the writing and humor were to 'Family Guy
' 'Full Moon High' has that same anything goes attitude and never takes itself seriously
Scanners II: The New Order is just as good as David Cronenberg's classic Scanners, Scanners was made in 1980 and Scanners II in 1991 so their's an eleven year gap between the two movies
The film captures the style of Scanners which is a good thing, it wouldn't be Scanners without a head explosion so Scanners II has a head explosion scene that's just has gruesome as the first
Scanners II: The New Order has some other imaginative gory scenes that are done well
The plot to Scanners II: The New Order is a new take on the series since it has the Scanners being used as a vigilante force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young Scanner named David Kellum discovers he's being used and decides to get revenge
<br /><br />Scanners II: The New Order is a great sequel to David Cronenberg's sci-fi classic Scanners and should be seen
If it's action and adventure you want in a movie, then you'd be best advised to look elsewhere
On the other hand, if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with that mood, check out "The Straight Story
"<br /><br />Richard Farnsworth puts on a compelling performance as the gentle and gentlemanly Alvin Straight, in this true story of Alvin's journey on a riding mower across three states to see his estranged brother who has had a stroke
<br /><br />Farnsworth is perfect in this role, as he travels his long and winding road, making friends of strangers and doling out lots of grandfatherly type advice about family along the way
The story moves along as slowly as the riding mower, but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching, waiting for the next life lesson Alvin's going to offer
<br /><br />Stretch out on the couch, relax and enjoy
It's the only way to watch this very good movie, which rates a 7/10 in my book
While the British produced some hilarious and slick sitcoms in the 1990s - Ab Fab, Men Behaving Badly, One Foot in the Grave, etc
<br /><br />In the 1970s there were whole new territories to explore, including the sexual revolution, feminism, and the slowly evolving awareness of a need for "sensitivity" that would, twenty years later, become Political Correctness
Attempts to grapple with the confusion of this thoroughly modern world were the subtle and not-so-subtle themes in everything from the skits of Monty Python's Flying Circus to sitcoms like Man About the House
(By the late 70s this "grappling" resulted in more meditative and bitter-sweet sitcoms such as the masterpiece Butterflies
)<br /><br />Man About the House is a perfect example of the good Britcoms of the time - slightly genteel, cheeky, fresh, ingenuous, sometimes outrageous, with some well made observations on contemporary life
Compare it to a cynical 90s show such as Ab Fab, and it is hard to believe the two were created in the same country
<br /><br />Man About the House is one of the great Britcoms of the 70s, right up there with Good Neighbors (The Good Life), and About the House's spin off George and Mildred
Its quality is attested to by the fact that - as with Good Neighbors - its creators, writers, and many of its cast have had continued success in British television
In a time when Hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses, despair, crime, drugs, and war, along comes this film which reminds us the concept of the "Indomitable Spirit"
If you are feeling beaten down, this movie will free your mind and set you soaring
We all know how tough life can be, sometime we need to be reminded that persistence and courage will get us through
That's what this film did for me and I hope it will for you
Kirk and crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode
They intend to evacuate the inhabitants but find the place deserted except for a Mr
Atoz who operates some sort of high-tech library
Despite trying to get a straight answer from him about everyone's whereabouts, Atoz is indifferent to their questions and insist they must quickly 'make a selection while there is still time'
They have no idea what he's talking about but wander about looking at the hand mirror-like disks on the viewers and they see images of the planet's past
Then, while a disk is in the viewer, Kirk runs through the doorway and is magically transported back in time to what on Earth would look like the time of Louis XIV (the 1660s)
When McCoy and Spock follow, a different disk is in the viewer and they are sent to an ice age hell
All too late they realize that the library is a time travel machine and repository
<br /><br />While Kirk's visit is pretty short and not all that exciting, Spock and McCoy's is much more eventful, as Spock falls head over heels for Mariette Hartley--who was sent to this awful place as a punishment
The scenes with Spock are exceptionally interesting and very atypical of the normally logical guy
<br /><br />Spock's departure from the norm, the wildly inventive script and very diverse locales make this an exceptional episode--one well worth seeing
<br /><br />FYI--Ian Wolfe, the excellent character actor, played Mr
I am a huge fan of older films and have seen him as a supporting and bit player in countless films in the 30s and 40s and he looked almost exactly like he did in this episode from 1969
Interestingly enough, despite looking ancient, he lived on another 23 years--dying at over 95 years of age!
Another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after Batman:Dead End that just helps stimulate our taste buds and leave us wanting more! This is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like! Even tough this is a fanfilm of sorts
The attention to detail, character and action is undeniably real
Although this is a limited resources production, it puts to shame big budgeted, star-casted, hyped productions "other" superhero related movies
Here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people
Finally, a Superman that actually looks "super" and looks like the real thing! Batman the way it should be, without the flashy rubber-casted , ripped body armor to hide scrawny physiques for over paid actors that don't deliver
I just wish that some sensible Warner Bros
exec gives the OK to produce a full length adaptation of this jewel
I don't care if it goes to theaters or straight to DVD, I would never get tired of watching it
Just the plot itself is worth my hard earned dough for this
Hope the "bigwigs" at Marvel & DC productions take a look and see what a real well produced superhero movie should look
No more "Batman & Robin" fiasco, or Hulk, Daredevil, etc
Learn from these small time directors and learn that there shouldn't be any reason to "reinvent" the hero for the movie, just to have it "bomb" in theaters
I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles
I thought the story was good but there were times when some of the subcharacters were grossly over-acting
This took away from the film as did the fairly lame musical score, which really irked me throughout the entire movie
If the musical score was improved I could overlook the few overacted scenes
When a stiff turns up with pneumonic plague (a variant of bubonic plague), U
Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) immediately quarantines everyone whom he knows was near the body
Unfortunately, the stiff got that way by being murdered, and there's a good chance that the murderer will start spreading the plague, leading to an epidemic
Enter Police Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas), who is enlisted to track down the murderer as soon as possible and avert a possible national disaster
<br /><br />While Panic in the Streets is a quality film, it suffers from being slightly unfocused and a bit too sprawling (my reason for bringing the score down to an eight)
It wanders the genres from noirish gangster to medical disaster, police procedural, thriller and even romance
<br /><br />This is not director Elia Kazan's best work, but saying that is a bit disingenuous
Kazan is the helmer responsible such masterpieces as A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), On The Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955), after all
This film predates those, but Kazan has said that he was already "untethered" by the studio
Taking that freedom too far may partially account for the sprawl
The film is set in New Orleans, a city where Kazan "used to wander around
I wanted boats, steam engines, warehouses, jazz joints--all of New Orleans"
<br /><br />Kazan handles each genre of Panic in the Streets well, but they could be connected better
The film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods
The sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked
Part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that Panic in the Streets was an attempt to merge two stories by writers Edna and Edward Anhalt, "Quarantine" and "Some Like 'Em Cold"
<br /><br />The gangster material, which ends up in firmly in thriller territory with an extended chase scene near the end of the film, is probably the highlight
Not surprisingly, Kazan has said that he believes the villains are "more colorful--I never had much affection for the good guys anyway
A close second is the only material that approaches the "panic" of the title--the discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down the exposed, inoculate them and contain the disease
While there is plenty of suspense during these two "moods", much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama, with pacing more typical of that genre
<br /><br />The dialogue throughout is excellent
The stylistic difference to many modern films could hardly be more pronounced
It is intelligent, delivered quickly and well enunciated by each character
Conflict isn't created by "dumb" decisions but smart moves; events and characters' actions are more like a chess game
When unusual stances are taken, such as Reed withholding the plague from the newspapers, he gives relatively lengthy justifications for his decisions, which other characters argue over
<br /><br />In light of this, it's interesting that Kazan believed that "propriety, religion, ethics and the middle class are all murdering us"
That idea works its way into the film through the alterations to the norm, or allowances away from it, made by the protagonists
For example, head gangster Blackie (Jack Palance in his first film role) is offered a "Get Out of Jail Free" card if he'll cooperate with combating the plague
<br /><br />The technical aspects of the film are fine, if nothing exceptional, but the real reasons to watch are the performances, the intriguing scenario and the well-written dialogue
Some war movies succeed where others do not, and that can be judged from a variety of angles
The humanistic angle, one where you can feel the raw emotions (the terror of being under attack, the camaraderie amongst soldiers, the arduous trials people face inside them when in combat, etc
Movies like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are but two examples of movies that you sense a connection to the characters in the film
<br /><br />This film succeeds on that level as well
It speaks of "The Highest Honor" and that honor is doing the right thing
These 23 soldiers did the right thing, they had honor and it is recognized in a way wholly incompatible with Western thought, but it is, to the very end, a true story of honor
When Gundam0079 became the movie trilogy most of us are familiar with, a lot of it was sheer action and less of anything else
Though there're only half a dozen episodes, it isn't filled with action, but emotional things
The two main action sequences in this, I believe, are enough to satisfy me
After seeing so many gundam series, movies, and OVAs, I was completely ready for a civilian-esquire movie
What makes this movie stand out is that shows both sides of the war have good and bad people
It made the Zeons seem more human rather than the original movies where they're depicted as the second rise of evil Nazis
Most people that don't like anime that I've forced to watch this movie (lol), liked it
So, I'd recommend it to a lot of people just for the anti-war story
If you're a Gundam fan, and haven't seen this, you shouldn't be reading this; you should already be watching it right now
It was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact Even by today's standards, the film is interesting and provocative <br /><br />Therese and Isabelle are both attending the same girl's school Therese is energetic, intelligent, and becomes a mentor for the innocent, naive, sweet Isabelle She guides her through a number of exotic experiences, including a trip through an exclusive brothel, into her first lesbian liaison, and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience <br /><br />The film does not exploit any sex, nor is there an abundance of nudity
The imagery is effective, but sometimes the camera lingers too long, and the story goes slowly <br /><br />The director, Radley Metzger, went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of Henry Paris He always has extremely detailed stories, good acting, and very high standards of cinematography
<br /><br />Artistically, however, this is perhaps his most complete His later attempts supplied for entertainment, whereas "Therese and Isabelle" was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism
Billie Clark is twenty years old, very pretty, and without a care in the world,until a brutal street gang violates her life, and she turns into an ALLEY CAT bent on revenge! When the gang attacks her grandparents house and her car, Billie uses her black belt prowess to fight them off

When her grandparents lose their lives to the brutal thugs
Billie becomes like a cat stalking her prey-and no prison,police force,boyfriend,or crooked judge can get in the way of her avenging claws
She's a one-woman vigilante squad,a martial arts queen,a crack shot with no mercy

I probably doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw Secret Ballot (2001)
Now I know about four times as much (I doubt I learned a whole heck of a lot from Not Without My Daughter (1991))
<br /><br />Offside is a splendid budget Iranian comedy about a group a girls (working individually) to attend a decisive soccer match for their country's place in the World Cup
Women are not allowed to attend soccer matches, so the nation's armed forces have been mobilized to save any women who try to enter from themselves
Some (teen?) girls try to crash the party by dressing as boys, but are caught
The movie is mostly set at this holding pen where the girls are detained by soldiers, awaiting some unspecified punishment (although, the girl who dressed as a soldier claims that she was one insignia away from being executed!)<br /><br />The movie explores the absurdity of the situation
The thinking that bars women from football matches comes down to it being too raunchy an experience for the fairer sexa philosophy not unknown in the west less than 100 years ago
This farce comes to a head when a girl needs to go to the bathroom, so a soldier escorting her demands that she cover her eyes so she can't see the graffiti
The conflict is not entirely about the battle of the sexes: at one point some friction arises between a solider who is rural and the girls who are urban
<br /><br />Fortunately, this movie was not too culturally esoteric that the comedy was lost on this neighbour and cultural cousin of the Great Satan
You have to be in the mood for it, but no one should avoid this movie because they think that they won't get it
Michael Bay should've studied this film before making either of his over hyped, overlong, overly pointless "Transformers" movies
"Robot Jox" is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the "Transformers" crew spent on Megan Fox's personal trainer
<br /><br />Thankfully, this little robotic gem, initially known mainly for being the film that bankrupted Charles and Albert Band's Empire Pictures studio, seems to have developed a cult following over the years
I fondly remember watching it on VHS during its initial video release in the early 90s and though some of the Cold War-era politics/stereotypes were already out of date by that time (just the Bands' luck that Communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released, eh?), it's still a pretty damn cool little B-Movie
They really don't make'em like this anymore, or if they do, they go the Bay route and CGI things to unbearable proportions
<br /><br />For those who are unfamiliar, here's the Robo-scoop: We're somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust, large scale "wars" have been outlawed
Disputes between nations are now settled mano-a-mano (or perhaps that should be machine-o-machine-o) by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized Shogun Warrior style robots
Whichever 'bot walks away from the fight wins for "his" side
Gary Graham (who would later go on to play Detective Sykes in the "Alien Nation" TV series), plays "Achilles," the greatest Robot Jock in Marketplace (a
Achilles has been undefeated in his previous nine Robot bouts (ten being the maximum number of battles before a "Jock" is retired) and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the "Confederation" (i
The Russkies!), the psychotic Alexander (who is the most over the top "evil Russian" stereotype bad guy since Dolph Lundgren's infamous turn as Ivan Drago in "Rocky IV")
The match is called a draw when Alexander violates the rules with an illegal Robot Move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing Achilles, but killing a whole bunch of spectators in the bargain
A rematch is scheduled to complete the bout, but Achilles simply wants to bow out, hang up his helmet and move on with his life
Rather than violate the Spoiler Rules by revealing much more, I will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns, behind the scenes skullduggery, and other difficulties for Achilles and his fellow "Jox" before the two robotic titans clash finally once again in the finale
<br /><br />I hope I'm not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction, because it isn't
I'll grant that it is a bit higher-concept than your average B-grade sci-fi movie, and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known (especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious green-screen trickery), it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the Empire/Full Moon Pictures factory
The robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motion/model techniques, and the sets and costumes don't look half-assed in the slightest
Empire Pictures and director Stuart ("Re-Animator") Gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture
Unfortunately it didn't quite pan out for them (or the studio) but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal
Bottom line: if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for 2+ hours, feel free to rent a "Transformers" movie
By the end you're likely to feel like you've spent all that time watching someone else play a video game
If you want to have a rock'em, sock'em robot good time, pick up Robot Jox instead
I participate in a Filmmaker's Symposium, and this film was shown after we had already seen a not so great film and participated in a 40 minute discussion
Even though it was incredibly late and we were weary, the entire audience really enjoyed it
<br /><br />Personally I thought the film was hilarious in all the right spots, and I loved the quirky cast of characters
You like to solve mysteries? You like complex narrations? This is for you
Brilliant, clever movie by Francis Leclerc(son of a legendary french Canadian signer Felix Leclerc)
Flashy photo and clever editing is the word of Leclerc, strongly helped by Roy Dupuis who's dythirambic in the lead role
<br /><br />The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown
Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer's sufferings on the road
Throughout the struggling, he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him
<br /><br />Not spooky, but very mysterious and well played movie
I have my hypothesis on the ending(I think the Indian caused the accident) but this ending was open to any explanations
Weak scripts at times? Yep! Cheesy special effects at times? Yep! Deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time? Yep! More about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yep! I always enjoyed science fiction as a kid, but found so much of the Dracula/Frankenstein/Mummy/horror stuff as just so much crap
It took Abbott and Costello to give me a new perspective on the classic Universal monsters, and it took Carl Kolchak to win me over to the "dark side" of entertainment
The Duke had Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood had Dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck had Magnum, and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak
Mixed in with all those weak scripts, cheesy special effects, that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars, there was Darren McGavin as Carl Kolchak
He had a wry sense of humor in spite of the danger, was an idealist in his pursuit of the truth, and a realist when it came to accepting the obligatory incompetence and eventual cover-up by government officials
Additionally, unlike 98% of us, Kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done, even if it meant his demise, the end of his journalistic career, or jail time
For all his faults, including no taste in clothes, Carl Kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove a beautiful classic yellow Mustang (which was an old used car at the time) on his way to save the day for humanity
As good as any other fictional hero Carl Kolchak was the everyman hero brought to life every week for one season thanks to Darren McGavin
Now that he's passed on and his show is on DVD, I hope he's having as much fun watching me watch him have fun playing Kolchak The Night Stalker all over again
The cult movie for every true Russian intellectual
Everything is brilliant, especially acting: it's beyond any praise
The movie, as the book, is full of symbols: my favorite one is the brightest symbol of Razrukha (colloquial Russian word for "devastation", often signifies the period of lifestyle chaos after the 1918-20 Civil War) -- the wide-opened dirty door in the bricky wall squeaking in the snowy wind and the pitch-black hole of the doorway behind it
<br /><br />Now the film is released on DVD with fully restored image and the 5
1 sound, there are well-translated English subtitles too, though some obscene words of Sharikov were replaced by the more mild versions in the translation
I don't know is that DVD available abroad but if you'll find it grab it immediately, it's really worthy of watching
<br /><br />And, in conclusion, a fact: about the 50% of Russians today, mostly youth, can be identified as Sharikovs in a considerable degree
It's the post-Soviet effect: Soviet people appeared to be wholly unprepared for the informational attack of the Western civilization, TV-producers and movie makers have made the entertainment industry and the mass media amazingly aggressive, soulless and thoughtless so that it abetted the darkest instincts of every Russian
Even among the Internet users every third one uses the obscene language in forums and chats because it's amazingly common in colloquial speech
Lee Chang-dong's exceptional "Secret Sunshine" is the single most emotionally ravaging experience of the year
It is an instantly sobering, brutally honest character piece on the reverberations of loss and a graceful memento mori that resonates with a striking density of thought, yet remains as inscrutable as the emotions it observes
Through its layered naturalism and stunningly trenchant view of small-town dynamics, Lee implicitly deconstructs the traditional Korean melodrama by pulling apart the cinematics of excess and ripping to shreds the arcs that shape its characters and grounds the proceedings into a crushing grind of stoic realism
<br /><br />"Secret Sunshine" remains an immensely compelling, fluid work throughout its 142-minute runtime
Its bravura first hour is filled to the brim with subtextual insinuations, remarkable foreshadowing and adroit reversals of tone brought about by humanistic capriciousness
Adapted from a short story, Lee infuses the film with his sensitivity for the sublime paradoxes of life, last seen in his transgressively comic and irreverent "Oasis"
Understanding how personal revolutions are forged when views of our universe are changed, Lee not only sees the emotional cataclysm of a widow's sorrow through an inquiring scope but also feels the tumultuous existential currents that underpin the film when religion becomes a narrative scapegoat in comprehending the heinousness of the human experience
<br /><br />Do-yeon Jeon's ("You Are My Sunshine") Best Actress accolade at Cannes in 2007 is well deserved
Her performance as the widow Shin-ae remains an unrelenting enigma
As a character pulled apart by forces beyond her control, the sheer magnificence of this performance is central to the film's turbulent nature
With Jeon essaying one cyclonic upheaval after another, there's a tremulous sense of collapse that the film, to its credit, never approaches
Instead it finds a delicate balance that saps the charged theatricality and subsequent banality from ordinary tragedies and its fallouts
She becomes the centre of the film's universe as well as ours
Filmed in glorious hand-held CinemaScope, the film demolishes the cinematicism of frames and compositions by becoming visually acute just as it is quietly harrowing when the camera never relinquishes its gaze from Shin-ae through times of happiness, guilt and remorse
<br /><br />Lee captures the details of life in the small, suspicious town of Miryang  the awkwardness of communal situations, its uncomfortable silences and its devastations spun out of personal dramas
Shin-ae's interactions with the townsfolk rarely inspires dividends, especially when they are merely done out of obligation to fit in for the sake of her son, Jun (Seon Jung-yeop)
The one recurring acquaintance is Jong-chan (Song Kang-ho), a bachelor mechanic of uncertain intentions who helps her en route to Miryang in the film's enchanting open sequence set to a captivating stream of sunlight
Song has situated himself as a comedic anti-hero in South Korea's biggest films but his nuanced, low-key delivery here purports the director's thought process of never having to reveal more than plainly necessary
<br /><br />If pain is ephemeral, then grief can never truly dissipate
When Shin-ae attempts to head down the path of reconciliation only to be faced again with unimaginable heartbreak, she unsuccessfully employs the fellowship of evangelical Christianity as a foil to her sorrow
But Lee knows better than that when he understands that religion, in the context of the human canvas of strife and misery, is never a simple solution
But Lee never rebukes the essence of religion as he realises the value of salvation for some through a higher power even if it serves a form of denial in others
The scenes in its latter half which deal with religion doesn't allow itself to become aggressively scornful, which is a feat in itself considering how many filmmakers let the momentum of the material take over from what they need to say to be true to its story and characters
<br /><br />Lee's first film since his call to office as his country's Minister of Culture and Tourism is an uncompromising dissertation on human suffering
In a film so artless and genuine, it arduously reveals that there's nothing as simple as emotional catharsis, just the suppression and abatement of agony
"Secret Sunshine" leaves us with tender mercies pulled out of evanescence, and points towards a profound understanding of despair and faith
Clark Gable plays a con man who busts into the life of hard-boiled dame Jean Harlow
He tries to sucker her while she brushes him off with her tough-gal attitude
Despite their cynicism and cons they fall in love
When Gable accidentally kills a man during a sting he runs out leaving loyal Harlow to women's prison where she discovers she's pregnant
Anita Loos' and Howard Emmett Rogers' writing is excellent throughout with many well-drawn and surprising characters (including a Jewish socialist woman inmate and a black woman inmate and her preacher father played with hardly a trace of stereotype)
Gable and Harlow show their mettle as actors adding telling nuances and quirks to their characters that send them beyond the typical Gable and Harlow roles
And the direction is much better than you'd expect from Sam Wood
One beautiful shot has Harlow being inducted into the prison, then led out into a surprisingly snowy courtyard as the camera tracks after her
This is one of the best of both the "criminals in love" and "women's prison" genres and has some of the best hard-boiled dialogue ever written
Watching Before The Devil counts as one of my all time best experiences at the cinema
I have been intrigued my the mixed response to the film - and for me, the extremes of opinion indicate the film touched on something either embraced or disavowed by the general audience
It is one of those films that has stayed with me, and I continue to ponder and think about it
<br /><br />Surely the DVD would illuminate some more of the themes and the film-making elements? Which include: Sidney Lumet's comeback movie, the time-shifting technique deployed in the storytelling, the superb combination of Lumet and Masterson and why it works so well, the masterly direction, the relatively rare focus Hollywood movies give to male characters and their largely doomed struggle to become an open cheque book for their women, the under-presented, but nevertheless resonant Marisa Tomei's performance, and, of course, the superb Hoffman with that central monologue about the sum of his parts - for me the heart of the movie
<br /><br />Phew! Surely a masterful film
So imagine my disappointment watching the eagerly anticipated DVD - only to find no commentary, no behind-the-scenes, no interviews, no extras
<br /><br />Hey - distributors - sort it out
Simply one of the best ever! Richard Brooks' adaptation of Truman Capote's non-fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement
Stunning black and white cinematography (that should have won an Oscar), a haunting Quincy Jones score and tremendous performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as the oddly-matched killers
This film was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and wasn't even nominated for Best Picture while Dr
Go Figure! <br /><br />Although you don't get to know the Clutter family as well as you do in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the pain-staking process of tracking these guys down
John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey
The movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin
<br /><br />The main protagonist/antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical all American teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father (Baldwin)
However, when she meets an ex con called Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan "Never been kissed") they instantly 'fall' for each other, but Jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship
she manipulates him to kill her parents, to protect their 'love' but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with Brad (David Lascher future 'Sabrina' cast mate for Hart)
Melissa Joan Hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder
The rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time
I also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year, Hart, began portrayed Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television
<br /><br />Although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to 'Nine Dead' that comes out in November because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called "Clarissa Darling " or Sabrina Spellman"<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina
You can watch this on the internet, so i suggest check it out
The kids, aged 7 to 14, got such a huge kick out of this film that we gave a copy to all of the other kids on our birthday list this year
They all loved it! Kids from 2 to 7 watch it repeatedly and frequently, and we get a kick out of watching it with them
<br /><br />It's rare that a film entertains the kids for so long, and offers laughs for the adults, too
<br /><br />Top-quality production and an excellent cast, led by Christopher Showerman as a superior George--athletic, energetic, and wholly credible, with a lovable innocence and a particular knack of taking a tree in the face--well supported by the inimitable Christina Pickles as the evil mother-in-law, Thomas Haden Church as the evil jerk rival, and everybody else
I'm no big fan of Martial Arts movies, but the video shop was nearly empty and Jet Li was in Lethal Weapon 4 and I got it free when the other films I'd rented, either way I rented it
I absolutely loved it, my flatmate and myself (22 year old Biochemistry and Accountancy students) spent the half hour after the film making strange Kung Fu noises and throwing beermat shurikens at each other
I can't explain it (well maybe a little tequila)
I never enjoyed Bruce Lee, skinny bloke kicking big bloke, beating him, kicking bigger bloke etc film ends
Think Jackie Chan with a little less comedy and more action
The Write Word<br /><br />What you see is what you get
Not really! What Madhur Bhandarkar's brave and brilliant 'Page 3' does is destroy the myth attached to the glam and glitterati that colour the pages of our newspapers and whose lives(read party habits) we follow with such maniacal fervour which only our intrinsic voyeuristic streak can explain
<br /><br />The page 3 phenomenon is as deplorable as it is enigmatic
How exactly did it gain such control over the printed word and when did it start to encroach into the front page is subject for another debate
He is concerned only with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence
And in doing that, he pieces together the various elements of this way of life
Like Robert Altman(although I'm not comparing Bhandarkar to Altman's genius), Bhandarkar uses myriad characters to further his motive
Whether it is a page 3 wannabe NRI, the gate-crashers, the newly-rich, an upcoming model, a socialite politician or an erotic novella authoress; all the characters are introduced with an objective and each of them has a separate character-sketch, even if their parts may be miniscule
<br /><br />Konkona Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 for Nation Today
Initially content with her job, she soon begins to see the ugliness of this underbelly that is covered by its fake and cosmetic profligacy
But Bhandarkar resists the temptation to make this subject into a moral-policing movie and avoids concentrating on one character alone
Hence the movie is not only about Madhavi, but also equally about Deepak Suri(Boman Irani)- Madhavi's editor who passively accepts his role as a cog of a larger machinery, Anjali Thapar(Soni Razdan)- a socialite suffocating from the social pollution, Abhijeet(Rehan Engineer)- a homosexual make-up artist and Madhavi's roommates Pearl(Sandhya Mridul)- the sassy airhostess and Gayatri(Tara Sharma)-an aspiring actress
It seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many characters(and more) in one story, but full credit to Nina Arora and Manoj Tyagi for penning a tight screenplay
The dialogues by Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar have been written with great attention to detail
<br /><br />Any narrative, no matter how good, can fall flat with the lack of genuine performances
Thankfully, 'Page 3' brims with actors and not stars
Konkona goes through her author-backed role with effortless ease
Sandhya Mridul gets the best written part, but almost overdoes it
Atul Kulkarni is wasted though with an underwritten character
At times, the director seems too keen to incorporate as much as possible(paedophilia, homosexuality, etc
But the contexts in which they are used do not make them look rushed
<br /><br />Ultimately, Bhandarkar's attempt is to satiate our voyeurism, but he takes it a step further
He takes us inside the photographs and exposes us to the gruesome realities of this sect of humanity that strangely seems to be living in a different and remote world
These are the same people that indulged in new-year's revelry while a few hundred kilometers away their fellow countrymen had been ravaged by nature's ferocity! Clever writing, skillfully incorporated songs, able performances and a genuine feeling of sincerity are what make this film worthy in spite of its lack of finesse and poor production values
'Page 3' is an optimum way to enter a new year of cinema
<br /><br />- Abhishek Bandekar<br /><br />Rating- ****<br /><br />* Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent<br /><br />29th January, 200
but I want to say I cannot agree more with Moira
<br /><br />I was thinking about it just this morning, wanting to give advice to some dopey sod who'd lost money on his debit card through fraud, and wanted to say 'Keep thy money in thine pocket' and realised I was talking like James Mason
<br /><br />Even tho he didn't say those words, I still think he would! I've never forgotten 'Are ye carrying?' in his reconciliation with his son, Hywel Bennet: 'Always have money in thine pocket!' Good advice
<br /><br />Not enough kids have fathers with such unforgiving but well-meant attitudes any more
<br /><br />It would be a good thing for us to reinstate 'thee', 'thy' and 'thine' in our language to show we care
It is only the same as 'tutoyer' in French or 'du' in German
<br /><br />Addendum: I just realised that a lot of my remarks were about James Mason in The Family Way!<br /><br />I think it's because I mixed up Susan George with Hayley Mills
<br /><br />And Spring and Port Wine is so very similar to The Family Way
<br /><br />When you took a girlfriend to the pictures in those days, you really had something to say and talk about afterwards, something that affected your knowledge of the world and your personal development
<br /><br />Theatrical experiences are almost real, and they are important in helping young people to grow up
<br /><br />It doesn't happen now, I think, that teenagers can just go to the pics like we did
All right, here's the deal: if you're easily offended then you might want to stay far, far away from this one
There are some painfully funny moments in the movie, but I probably blushed about as much as I laughed
Actually, I probably blushed MORE than I laughed
And if I wasn't literally blushing on the outside, then I was blushing on the inside
If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame
Whether that's a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder I suppose
<br /><br />I will not deny that I laughed quite a bit, but this is a movie that I simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter
If I were to say, "This movie is hilarious, go check it out!" and some sweet, little old church-going lady heads to the theater and has a heart-attack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations, well, that's just something I don't need on my conscience
<br /><br />So how raunchy is it? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers
My mom would've walked out during the first scene
I feel it's my duty to at least warn you of what to expect
<br /><br />There is some cleverly intelligent comedy here, but that's what I come to expect from the man (Judd Apatow) who had a hand in both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared
I'm all for making fun of Michael McDonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money
Paul Rudd proclaiming, "If I hear Ya Mo Be There one more time I'll Ya Mo burn this place down," is hilarious, but it's one of those things that the majority of the audience won't appreciate
<br /><br />And when we see a quick 3-second flashback of Steve Carrell singing along to Cameo's Word Up, I laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over, whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it
<br /><br />Strangely enough, despite the raunch, there's an admirable moral to the story
The movie doesn't portray Carrell as some freaky loser just because he's a virgin
He's really portrayed as a likable, admirable character
After all, he has a framed Asia poster, "more videogames than an Asian kid," and a toy collection that features the Million Dollar Man's BOSS, but we're never led to believe that there's actually anything wrong with the fact that he's a virgin
As odd as it may seem, there's a bit of an "it's OK to wait" message
<br /><br />But man, oh man, please be warned that this pushes its R rating about as far as it can go
According to him, he just let some of the guys (particularly Rogen and Malco) improv and talk the way they normally talk, all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty
If you can handle that or talk that way yourself, then you'll love the movie
<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes
I find that subtle, clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the f-word or fratboy sex discussions
Like I said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself if they're worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you're likely to ever see at the theater
I just don't know how interested most women will be in what's discussed by men while playing poker
Honestly ladies, you might not want to know
If you've ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross, well, this gives you a good idea
<br /><br />There you go - my humble, honest take on what to expect
It definitely should not be seen with your Sunday School class, mama, grandmama, any family members of the opposite sex, children of any age, or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion
If you'd see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable
"Panic" is a captivating, blurred-genre film about a brooding and conflicted middle aged hitman's reconciliation of infatuation with a younger uninhibited hairstylist, his love of wife and son, his duty to his employer/father with his own identity
Although the film has a nebulous purpose and an ambiguous ending, it is a superb production in almost all aspects
The characters' clarity and sincerity in such an improbable story may both fascinate and annoy audiences
He was hampered in directing this film by the producer
The final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story, but some amazing moments of animation (like Emery Hawkins' "Greedy")
Joe Raposo's repetitive music doesn't help either
It was made in wide screen so the VHS doesn't show it in all it's glory, let's hope for a letterboxed DVD someday
Still it's worth watching for some eye popping animation
For some reason, this film has never turned up in its original language in my neck of the woods (despite owning the TCM UK Cable channel, which broadcasts scores of MGM titles week in week out)
on DVD  even from Warners' recently-announced "Western Classics Collection" Box Set (which does include 3 other Robert Taylor genre efforts); maybe, they're saving it for an eventual "Signature Collection" devoted to this stalwart of MGM, which may be coming next year in time for the 40th anniversary of his passing <br /><br />I say this because the film allows him a rare villainous role as a selfish Westerner with a fanatical hatred of Indians and who opts to exploit his expert marksmanship by making some easy money hunting buffaloes; an opening statement offers the alarming statistic that the population of this species was reduced from 60,000,000 to 3,000 in the space of just 30 years! As an associate, Taylor picks on former professional of the trade Stewart Granger  who rallies alcoholic, peg-legged Lloyd Nolan (who continually taunts the irascible and vindictive Taylor) and teenage half-breed Russ Tamblyn to this end
As expected, the company's relationship is a shaky one  reminiscent of that at the centre of Anthony Mann's THE NAKED SPUR (1953), another bleak open-air MGM Western
The film, in fact, ably approximates the flavor and toughness of Mann's work in this field (despite being writer/director Brooks' first of just a handful of such outings but which, cumulatively, exhibited a remarkable diversity); here, too, the narrative throws in a female presence (Debra Paget, also a half-breed) to be contended between the two rugged leads  and Granger, like the James Stewart of THE NAKED SPUR, returns to his job only grudgingly (his remorse at having to kill buffaloes for mere sport and profit is effectively realized)
<br /><br />The latter also suffers in seeing Taylor take Paget for himself  she bravely but coldly endures his approaches, while secretly craving for Granger  and lets out his frustration on the locals at a bar while drunk! Taylor, himself, doesn't come out unscathed from the deal: like the protagonist of THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE (1948), he becomes diffident and jealous of his associates, especially with respect to a rare  and, therefore, precious  hide of a white buffalo they've caught; he even goes buffalo-crazy at one point (as Nolan had predicted), becoming deluded into taking the rumble of thunder for the hooves of an approaching mass of the species! The hunting scenes themselves are impressive  buffaloes stampeding, tumbling to the ground when hit, the endless line-up of the day's catch, and the carcasses which subsequently infest the meadows
The film's atypical but memorable denouement, then, is justly famous: with Winter in full swing, a now-paranoid Taylor out for Granger's blood lies in wait outside a cave (in which the latter and Paget have taken refuge) to shoot him; when Granger emerges the next morning, he discovers Taylor in a hunched position  frozen to death! <br /><br />Incidentally, my father owns a copy of the hefty source novel of this (by Milton Lott) from the time of the film's original release: actually, he has collected a vast number of such editions  it is, after all, a practice still in vogue  where a book is re-issued to promote its cinematic adaptation
Likewise for the record, Taylor and Granger  who work very well off each other here  had already been teamed (as sibling whale hunters!) in the seafaring adventure ALL THE BROTHERS WERE VALIANT (1953)which, curiously enough, is just as difficult to see (in fact, even more so, considering that it's not even been shown on Italian TV for what seems like ages)!
On an overnight flight from Los Angeles to Miami, Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) meets a charming man who turns out to be a hired killer who demands her help killing a businessman or else her own father will die
<br /><br />Red Eye is a terrific thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats
The premise is similar to Cellular and Phone Booth but Red Eye is better than both of those films
Almost everything about Red Eye is above average including the suspense, the acting and the direction
Most of the film does take place on a plane but that doesn't slow down the movie
The film is very fast pace and exciting with no slow or boring spots
Wes Craven does a really good job behind the camera
Instead of focusing on the thrills, he focuses on the story and the characters
The movie does have its share of suspenseful moments but that's not what the film is really about
I also like the way Wes Craven focuses on the other passengers and the small details that become important later on
Red Eye really shows his skills at storytelling
<br /><br />Red Eye also works well because of its young and talented cast
Rachel McAdams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate
You may even end up cheering for her out loud
Cillian Murphy gives a very creepy and effective performance as the villain
The way he acts charming at first but then turns psycho is especially impressive
The supporting actors are also pretty good which include Brain Cox and Jayma Mays
<br /><br />The movie is also very stylish and it has this overall creepy vibe to it
The setting works well since there is an obvious fear of isolation and no escape
Overall, the tone of the film is consistently creepy
The screenplay isn't as strong as everything else though
There are a few unrealistic moments that may distract the viewer
Most of them didn't bother me but there were of few that left me shaking my head
It isn't a bad ending just a very simple one and a different approach would have been better
Since the movie focuses on the characters, there is really no scream moments maybe just a few jumps
If you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed
In the end, Red Eye is an engaging thriller and it's one of the best movies of the summer
This is a feel-good movie and nothing more
But so what? I am sure she wasn't trying to make 'Good Night and Good Luck' here
Let's not try to make it anything else but what it is
<br /><br />And very enjoyable at that!<br /><br />Do we remember what 1984 was like? We've become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we watch or not
Goldie knew this was fun-fluff and she went ahead and did it
<br /><br />Like her lightest fare: Protocol, Overboard, Housesitter, Wildcats, Private Benjamin, Seems Like Old Times, Foul Play, Death Becomes Her, First Wives Club and the remake of Out-of-Towners, GOLDIE knows what she is doing
she plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it! Goldie just knows herself really well, and she knows what she can do really well
<br /><br />She has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently
I loved her in Laugh-In and every thing she's ever been in
She has never tried to be anything else but who she is
and that's that bubbling, giggly, girl next door who happens to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always endear me and remind me that life is pretty short and you've just got to lighten up because before you know it
you are old, wrinkled and suffering from one of life's inevitable ailments
<br /><br />I appreciate Goldie for what she is: a lovable, comic actress
Presenting Lily Mars may have provided Judy Garland with one of the easier roles she had while at MGM because Lily Mars is definitely a character she could identify with
A young girl with talent enough for ten, she knows she has what it takes to make it in the theater no matter how much producer Van Heflin from her home town discourages her
<br /><br />I really liked Judy in this one as the girl determined to make it in the theater
Because it is Judy Garland with the talent of Judy Garland you in the audience know she has the right stuff even if it takes Van Heflin nearly the whole movie to be convinced
<br /><br />Both Judy and Heflin hail from the same small town, Heflin's dad was the town doctor who delivered her and Heflin while he may have moved away and become a big producer on Broadway, their respective moms, Fay Bainter and Spring Byington have kept in touch
That's her entrée, but Heflin's constantly barraged with stagestruck kids, but never anyone quite like Lily Mars
<br /><br />No real big song hits came out of Presenting Lily Mars for Garland, though she sings all her numbers
The best in the film is a revival of that gaslight era chestnut, Every Little Movement Has A Meaning All Its Own
Judy sings it with Connie Gilchrist playing the cleaning lady in a Broadway theater where Heflin's show is being produced
Gilchrist was a star back in the days of the FloraDora Girls and she and Judy deliver the song in grand style with Connie
It's the best scene in the film as Gilchrist encourages Judy to keep at it
Composer Karl Hoschna had died a long time ago, but lyricist Otto Harbach was still alive and I'm betting he liked what he heard
<br /><br />European musical star Marta Eggerth is in Presenting Lily Mars as the show's star who's at first bemused, then angry and finally, understanding of Garland and Heflin
She did a couple of films with MGM and then went back to Europe for more work on the continent
I'm betting MGM didn't quite know what to do with her and her thick Hungarian accent, though Louis B
<br /><br />Van Heflin does well as the patient producer who puts up with a lot from Garland and Eggerth
Heflin was just coming off his Oscar for Johnny Eager the previous year and he and Garland wouldn't appear to be an ideal screen team, but they're not bad together
<br /><br />Presenting Lily Mars is a fine showcase for the talents of Judy Garland
And she didn't have to share the screen in another backstage film with Mickey Rooney
i got to see the whole movie last night and i found it very exciting
it was at least,not like the teen-slasher movies that pop out every now and then
the search for the killer and the 'partner' relationship between the hero&the so-called bad guy was parts i liked about the movie
also,i remember once being on the edge of my seat during a specific scene in the movie
maybe some time later,i might watch the movie again
This is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary made-for-television drama
My all-time favourite actor, Robert Culp skillfully plots a trajectory through uptight liberal fairmindedness and faith in the system, kneejerk conservativism and fear of crime, and homicidal psychosis
The teens are a collection of pure sneering evil stereotypes, and the eventual message of this film makes episodes of Dragnet look evenhanded by comparison
But what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie, building the fear and paranoia by degrees, as well as the feel of the whole California setting
The cars are really great as well, as I recall
I give this film a 10, and I defy anyone to watch this film and not enjoy every minute
Remember, just because it's made-for-television doesn't mean it isn't great art
You will never be able to look at LION KING again without thinking of the extra history this movie adds
Nearly 40 years old, I watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight & I have not laughed & enjoyed a movie so much in a long time
<br /><br />Take time out and watch this with the kids
It will remind you of how Disney used to be when you were a young one
Ok, after reading a couple of reviews on Atlantis: The Lost Empire, I just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct rip off from Nadia: Secret of the Blue Water
The only part that was a ripoff from Nadia is that the pendant from Nadia and the pendant from Atlantis bear so much resemblence in terms of how it's used, origins and how it's created from the source of life that there's no doubt about it being copied
If you want to consider how Kida and Nadia is dressed alike then you could put that against Disney too(It was kind of wierd for Nadia and Kida to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci-fi, not to mention they both move in a similar style too)
As an anime fan I have to agree there's some degree of copying but it's only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original (like the encryption design on the wall in Laputa, the ancient mask from Princess Mononoke, the resemblence of the vehicles to the Garfish submarine in Nadia, etc)
The plot itself I believe it's highly original and it's quite amazing that Disney can pull it off without the use of Captain Nemo(the main character in Jules Verne's 20k Leagues Under the Sea which is also the main character in Nadia)
As for Mylo and Jean wearing similar style glasses
As shown in the novel "Lord of the Flies", glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence
I think Mylo, Jean, the main character from Stargate and a dozen of other "INTELLIGENT" characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses
As for the submarines, and how the submarines fight(with those wide blast torpedos which really resembles what Nautilius does), I want to state that it's a required element for either one if Atlantis is involved in the plot(after all it's a sunken city beneath the waters)
As for the crew having some charactistical resemblence with the crew from Nautilius in Nadia, it might be the artwork but I don't sense any copyright infringement there as the character's personalities were perfectly original to me
As an anime fan that rated Nadia as the #1 best anime I ever watched even now today
I do have my doubts about Atlantis when I first saw the preview
But now that I watched the movie, I once again regained my confidence with Disney and have high hopes for their future movies after Atlantis
Overall, the best Disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it's a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better
Also, it's amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning (I was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how Disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing
"Such a Long Journey" is a well crafted film, a good shoot, and a showcase for some good performances
However, the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of Jack of all plots and master of none
Also, Western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure Parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in 1
Recommended for those with an interest in India
Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in show business
I have read both of his books and think that he is great
Peter Faulk can deliver a punch line with the best of them
<br /><br />This is a story about a family really getting to know each other
Through a road trip a father and son connect for the first time in their lives in the midts of a family crisis
They do all the things that fathers and sons are suppose to do in life
they are just doing them much later in life
The situations are very funny, but have the feeling that they could actually happen to people in real life (not obsurdly over the top or cartoonish)
This is the first time that I watch Paul Reiser and fully believed every emotion that was portrayed
<br /><br />Gret movie and great story and plot
It has comedy and emotion but an uplifting message
This films makes no pretentious efforts to hide its true genre -- a campy B movie
It will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of campy
It should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese
But the two come together in this film in ways that make you go, "Hmmmmm
that's so stupid!" and then have you laughing
For example, there is a scene back in "16th Century Japan", which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple
In the background of the temple, there are several tourists looking off in the distance in slippers and shorts
And the acting goes from decent, to bearable, to oh my Lord, but that's what makes it funny
You'll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible
I have to digress somewhat though because I have seen Stephanie Sanchez in several plays and she is awesome
Her air time in the film was pretty short though
I have also seen Bryan Yamasaki in several plays in the islands during my visits and he's also better in theatre than in this movie
Anyhow, it's an entertaining film, if you've got nothing to do on a weekday evening
This is a very rare example of a movie about transvestitism (of heterosexuals)
The film treats the taboo theme so that even a general audience not knowing of transvestitism at all will strongly sympathize with its main character
Adrian Pasdar is very believable as Gerald/Geraldine and shall not be forgot for this brillant acting
The directing of Christopher Monger is very sensitively, treating such a difficult issue quite excellently, packed into a good story
Not a big movie, neither an "art" film, but a little, lovely motion picture
The first of two Jim Thompson adaptations released in 1990 (the other being the more well-known GRIFTERS), AFTER DARK has all of Thompson's hallmarks: dangerous women, the confidence game, and characters that are either not as dim as others suspect them of being, or not as harmless
<br /><br />Jason Patric is superb as a former boxer disqualified from the sport for life due to an incident in the ring (director James Foley uses RAGING BULL-esquire sequences to flesh out the back story) and the too-little-seen Rachel Ward also delivers a great performance
But Bruce Dern is the film's secret weapon: his sweet-talking grifter Uncle Bud subtly commands each of his scenes
<br /><br />there's almost no comic relief in this film, so watch it prepared to be sucked into the void
Loved it! What's not to like?--you got your suburbia, you got your zombies, you got your family issues, you got your social dilemmas, you got yourself one Fine Retro-1950's-style Flesh Eating Under Class Held At Bay By An Uneasy Worried About Whether They're The Next Meal Upper Crust
Carrie Ann Moss is absolute perfection as a debutante social climbing housewife
She's both wanton, and criminally conspiratorial
K'sun is really great as the son just trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence, and somehow succeeding
Without naming them all, the rest of the cast is wonderful
Henry Czerny plays a suspicious policeman with honed instincts and little squeamishness as if it's his everyday persona
A fine actor: I wish that he had played the title role in "Braveheart," with Gibson directing
My sense is that his William Wallace would have been closer to the actual character
<br /><br />In short, a great and marvelous satiric poke at morals, values, social pinnings, feelings, growth, coping in uncertain times, and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions
This is a very strange film by director/animator Richard Williams
All who know of William's work know it's a bit off-kilter (if not ingenious) but this one takes the cake
<br /><br />It features two hapless ragdolls who have to save their owner's new French doll from a lustful pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way
The strength in this movie lies primarily in its aesthetic quality; its strange character designs, its powerful animation, and its stark contrast of the sweet and scary
Williams' brilliant animation portrayed Raggedy Ann and Andy as real rag dolls, floppy and darned, rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls, which made it more believable (at least in a visual sense)
The animation shines on the bring us the Camel-with-the-Wrinkled-Knees, whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end, the silent-movie chase with Sir Leonard Looney and, of course, the Greedy
<br /><br />The Greedy animation, on its own, is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation I've ever seen
There's something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop--and every second it's something new
Living in what was deemed "the Taffy Pit," the Greedy is a massive blob man that lives in and mercilessly eats sweets
He sings a song that I can't help but feel hold some sexual undertones, then tries to kill Raggedy Ann for her candy heart
<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this film is that there are too many songs
It continuously bogs down the movie's pace because there are SIXTEEN of them
There are about six good songs (which should have been the only ones) including "I Look, And What Do I See?", "No Girl's Toy", "Blue" (though they didn't need to make him sing it twice), "I Never Get Enough", "Because I Love You" and maybe "I'm Home
" The others just seem unnecessary and frankly aren't too amazing to listen to
<br /><br />This is a weird film with strange undertones, but if that's what you're looking for, you won't find better
The interesting aspect of "The Apprentice" is it demonstrates that the traditional job interview and resume do not necessarily predict teamwork skills, task dedication, and job performance
And they certainly don't reveal any hidden agendas
In other words, a good indicator of potential may be to see a job applicant in action which is the point of "The Apprentice"
People vying for a corporate position may hand over a sugar-coated resume and put on their best personality attire for the interview, but these are not necessarily the best indicator of strengths, weaknesses, and performance
<br /><br />Briefly, "The Apprentice" involves 16 job candidates competing for the ultimate career opportunity: a position in real estate magnate Donald Trump's investment company
"The Apprentice" refers to the winner who will win a salaried position, learn the art of high stakes deal-making from the master himself, and, presumably, gain prime corporate connections
The position is a dream-come-true for those wanting to make more money than the GNP of some foreign countries
To entice the candidates, Trump shows off his private jet, his private luxury apartments replete with statues and artwork, his limos, his connections to celebrities, and other aspects of the life of a billionaire magnate
<br /><br />The road to success is not easy
The group is divided into two teams that compete against each other
Each has a corporate-sounding name, such as Versacorps and Protégé Corporation
The teams are assigned tasks that entail an entrepreneurial venture such as creating advertising, selling merchandise, or negotiating
Teams select a project manager who provides the leadership and organizational skills to complete the task
If they win, the manager receives a lot of credit, particularly in the eyes of the final arbiter
If they lose, the manager may also become the scape-goat
Some of the tasks are monumentally difficult with only a day or two to complete
Tasks may involve creating a TV commercial, or print ad
Others may involve selling at a retail outlet or on the street
<br /><br />The tasks bring out the best and worst in the participants
They often show immediately who is the most reliable, who is the most trustworthy, and who is hard working
And the tasks also expose who is not a good team player, who is inefficient, and who seems only out for themselves
The tasks invariably reveal in unexpected ways the strengths and weaknesses of the participants and in particular the project manager
How well the manager communicates with the team, delegates work, organizes time, and sets specific goals will largely determine the outcome, but it does not necessarily predict the winner
<br /><br />The single-most telling aspect of someone's potential is when he or she is assigned as a project manager
Their real abilities as opposed to their self-propagated abilities immediately show through the veneer that cannot be hidden by a $100 silk tie or a beautiful makeover
Leadership qualities and/or weaknesses often become agonizingly obvious after only a few minutes
Those promoting themselves as top-notch leaders are not always as strong when put into a real-life leadership situation
It is always easier to "toot your own horn" than to actually engage in leadership
Project managers, even those on the winning teams, often do not formulate a cohesive strategy
They often believe that by diving off the deep end to complete the task at the first minute rather than taking a little time to organize and discuss how the task will be completed is more efficient
More often than not, members of an ill-strategized team are running around like headless chickens figuring it out as they go along, and in the long run they end up wasting far more time
<br /><br />The winning team gets a taste of the high life, such as eating dinner at an exclusive restaurant, flying in a private jet, and/or meeting a celebrity
The losing team comes to the dreaded board room where Trump hears the lame excuses of the members and knocks off one or more of the contestants like pieces off a chess board with the now infamous "You're fired"
Often, the project manager is held partially responsible for the team's loss, and may be the target of Trump's accusatory rhetoric
Every week, at least one person becomes a casualty from the losing team
<br /><br />My least-favorite aspect of "The Apprentice" is the board room
While the tasks themselves bring out the strengths and weaknesses in the candidates, the board room often brings out the worst
Unfortunately, the rules of the game insist there is one winning team and one losing team, even if the competition was close
Members of the losing team start accusing each other, often ruthlessly, about who was at fault
And sometimes more than one person gets fired
I seldom see an under-performing candidate take responsibility for their actions in the board room
Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson were possibly the only candidates who took full responsibility for her team's losses and received no recognition for this selfless act
For me, Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson had the most integrity of all the candidates
However, Trump saw Kristi as weak and fired her, claiming she wasn't standing up for herself, which may mean he values ego more than integrity
No one should sacrifice their integrity for this
Kristi Frank may not have become the apprentice but she can live with herself knowing she did not blame others unjustly
Isn't that worth as much as "winning"?<br /><br />The strength of "The Apprentice" is also its weakness
Because team performance is evaluated strictly by winners and losers, other evaluation opportunities are overlooked
Barring huge gaps between the winning and losing teams, sometimes a losing team exemplifies a high standard of teamwork and efficiency
I have seen losing teams sometimes appearing better organized than the winning team
We Americans are so often obsessed with winning and losing that we often overlook excellence
A movie you start watching as a late night cable porn
It is hot in that department but it has even a lot more
some action in and out of the "bed" and it has reasonable acting as well as a story worth watching
A definite adult only movie but well worth watching
"Bend It Like Beckham" is a film that got very little exposure here in the United States
It was probably due to the fact that the movie was strongly British in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football, (soccer here), which some may have trouble relating too in the U
It's unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage over here
I think the basis of the storyline, (following a dream), is something many people can relate to and in the end, "Bend It Like Beckham" proves to be a good-feeling film with a source of inspiration and really good acting
I was not overly excited about seeing this film initially but now I regret not seeing it sooner
I remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1982 & loved it then
About 4 years later I had the privilege of seeing Luciano Pavarotti sing at the Metropolitan Opera house in New York (in Tosca) so seeing the ending of this film reminds me very much of that great night
What's not to like about this film? The music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Fini) was at his best and still looked great
The story is actually very funny in parts & the 'food fight' scene is still one of the funniest I have ever seen
The hot air balloon flight over the Napa valley was beautiful & so was the song he sang "If we were in love" (one of the few times Pavarotti sang in English)
And hearing the duet of Santa Lucia gorgeous
Get real folks, this was a film about an opera singer called Georgio Fini who just happened to be played by Pavarotti
Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles
<br /><br />I am VERY glad that I still have this almost worn out VHS tape of this movie but I would love this to be released on DVD especially now that Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes the best performance of Nessun Dorma sung by him still on film today
Really, I think this movie is more an example of an easy target than a truly bad film
In fact, the movie is done very well in many respects and is very entertaining
<br /><br />Yes, the script is a little convoluted, but that's the genre
The film has a noirish atmosphere centered around a femme fatale
Just like all the old noir classics, this, too, has a screenplay that twists you around so that you don't always know how to make sense of it at first, and it can be a stretch if you think too deeply and try to put all of the pieces together
In general, the script has enough surprises and turns to keep the viewer guessing and, in turn, surprised, without abandoning the viewer
<br /><br />Sharon Stone is also an easy target
The truth is she looks great and she speaks her double-entendre laden dialog in such a way as to zhuzh it up into something mysterious, sexy and fun
<br /><br />The direction is more than passable, because let's face it--you have to keep an audience interested in the "did she or didn't she?" question for two hours
In addition to a twisty script and a fun performance by Stone, this is done effectively through the direction by the creation of a noirish atmosphere that is both dark and very stark and modern at the same time, with straight industrial lines to go along with Stone's sexy curves
The frame is always beautiful--press pause anywhere and there is something interesting to the eye
<br /><br />The film also effectively builds on things that were gimmicks in the first film and turns them into something a little more real, particularly the sex
how shocking!" becomes treated more matter-of-factly here, and typically, the sexuality of the film is used to better effect
It is still titillating, but not done so readily for shock value and buzz as done in the first
I won't say that it isn't still somewhat of a gimmick because, let's face it, this film is supposed to be fun
It may be an easy target, but if you watch it for what it is: a noirish, femme-fatale driven, twisty, sexy, did-she-or-didn't-she who-dunnit, you're bound to enjoy it (no pun intended)
It is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity
However, because it has John Cleese as Sherlock Holmes it manages to be hilarious even on a budget that couldn't afford a shoestring
The highlight of this film is Arthur Lowe as the sincere, bumbling Watson, his dimness and slowness foils Cleese's quick-tempered wit
If you ever run across the film watch it for a quirky laugh or two
This is one of the best Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers films, or at least one of my favorites
Most of the A-R movies feature great dancing but sappy romance stories
This still has the courtship corniness but not as pronounced as the other films
<br /><br />This movie features not just great dancing but likable characters and a bunch of good songs
The music is the central theme here and what's nice is the addition of a tap solo by Rogers
She not only was a super dancer but a very pretty woman and one with tremendous figure
She dances also with Fred, of course, and they're always a fun pair to watch on the dance floor
<br /><br />Growing up in the 1950s watching "Ozzie & Harriet" on television, it was a real kick the first time I saw this to see such a young Harriet Hilliard
No surprise than Ozzie fell for this beauty
Although she had that short early '30s hairstyle, I recognized her voice right away
Also in this movie are quick appearances by Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, but I have to admit that I have yet to out Ball
I can't find her, but I know she's in here
<br /><br />Astaire, except for some obnoxious gum-chewing in the first third of the film, was fun to watch and Randolph Scott - although better in westerns - is likable, too
<br /><br />This is simply a nice, feel-good film and good one if you want to to enjoy the great talents of Astaire and Rogers
A lovely old - fashioned thriller coming on like a cross between Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch,"Red Rock West" follows the misadventures of injured veteran unemployed oil worker Mr N
Cage as his luck turns from bad to worse after he ends up with an empty gas tank and barely enough money for a cup of coffee in a one ute town in the back of beyond
It has been established right from the start that Mr Cage might be down but he is not out,and he might be broke but he will not steal,not even in his present dire circumstances
Walsh for the man he has commissioned to murder his wife,Mr Cage calls on the wife to warn her of her husband's intentions
Boyle, offers him even more money to murder Mr Walsh
Mr Cage decides to leave whilst he is still in front but as he is driving out of town he hits a man in the road
Tempted as he might be to drive on,he takes the man to hospital,where it turns out he has been shot
Mr Cage is detained by the Deputies who call the sheriff who turns out to be Mr J
Events take a further complicated turn when,escaping from custody,Mr
Cage narrowly avoids being run over by the real hit-man on his way to fulfill his commission
About now you might be forgiven for thinking "enough already",but as it happens on the screen it seems a completely logical turn of events,the narrative flow of the movie at this point seeming unstoppable
Hopper is comfortably cast as the hired killer,like Mr Cage a USMC veteran
This little piece of serendipity keeps Mr Cage alive long enough out-think the murderous trio and survive,a little more battered but still unbowed
It is a tribute to everybody involved that what sounds on paper remarkably like a piece of nonsense is in fact a tense exceptionally well made picture with fine performances all round
"Red Rock West" is a movie - lover's movie
Within five minutes you know you are going somewhere you've been before on plenty of occasions,but you'll be very happy during the trip
Most people who chase after movies featuring Audrey Tautou seem to not understand that Amelie was a character - it is not really Audrey Tautou's real life personality, hence, every movie she partakes in is not going to be Amelie part 2, part 3, etc
<br /><br />Now with that said, I too picked up this movie simply because Audrey was in it
Yes, it's true, there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn't seen at all for maybe 45 min, but I didn't even miss her because I was having so much fun with the other characters
The guy who lies about everything is too funny, the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss, actually
getting into all the characters here could take quite a while, but this is one of the best movies I've seen in a while
<br /><br />Audrey Tautou's character Irene is not the overdone sugary girl that Amelie was
In fact, as Irene, her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first
In this film, Irene is a girl with good intentions, but over the course of a (very awful) day, her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic
<br /><br />What makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building
very entertaining to watch, great scenery and shots, very colorful and never too slow, and all of the characters can actually act
The best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes left
this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense, and the whole butterfly effect blossoms
I swear, it was the best 20 minutes of film I've seen in quite a while, and the ending
It made me think "damn I really lucked out finding this movie"
Whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant, because not only are there all these other subplots going on, but to somehow make them all tie in together (and in a sensible manner, which is the case here) but also to make each character feel human and come alive, not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect
<br /><br />I highly suggest this movie as it's a great film to watch anytime, in any mood, with any company or alone
I have to say that sometimes "looks" are all that matters, just like Jeremy Clarkson from BBC has pointed out (not about our earth though, but he is right anyway)
<br /><br />And when it comes to looks, this movie is such an unbelievably stunning beauty you will absolutely love what your eyes are about to see
<br /><br />And then there's the personality of the movie as well, interesting, with a captivating narrator voice and narrator stories that will touch your soul as you watch those superbly filmed images
<br /><br />The movie probably won't affect your lifestyle, ruining these beauties, but it will certainly remember you how precious our earth we live on truly is
<br /><br />This movie deserves it's 10 stars as it is one of the few stylistic earth documentaries i truly enjoyed
Following directly from where the story left off in part one, the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man's legacy is exactly as such
In direct contrast to the first feature, part two represents a shift from Che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country, to Chestruggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties
The change of setting isn't just aesthetic; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature, replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical, battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle
Yet, as Che would go on to say himselfsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thata struggle
While Part One certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that, Part Two takes a much more refined, callous and bleak segment of Che's life and ambition, and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible, easy to grasp manner
<br /><br />While the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from Part One however, there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible
This somewhat distant, cold approach to telling Che's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off; indeed, I still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manif anything, the entirety of Che, taken as a whole, delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way
By no means does Soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what Hirschbiegel did with Der Untergang half a decade ago (excuse the ironic contrast); Che is a slow moving, reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who arguably- conducted the whole thing
<br /><br />Yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of Cuba and retreating to the bleak, decaying backdrop of Bolivia for Part Two, the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn't feel too disjointed from its predecessor, but does enough to give it its own reference points
Here, the basic structure of Part One is echoed backthere's the initial struggle, the battles, the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them, all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement
Yet, as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know, Part Two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming, and disquieting note
This difference, in combination with the similarities to Part One, make a compelling and memorable whole; by all means, both could be digested one their own (and kudos to Soderbergh for achieving as such) and enjoyed as they are, but taken as one statement, Che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve
<br /><br />Indeed, everything that made Part One the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building, realistically structured combat scenesthe drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible, but with a feature such as this, Part Two once again proves that avoiding such elements don't necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged
In fact, upon writing this review I was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for Part One, and title the review as a whole, yet I felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively
<br /><br />With that said, I cannot rightfully decree whether or not Che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime, but upon viewing both segments I can at least attest to each part's ability to do just that
With a reflective, intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie's characters without drawing attention to themselves, Che Part Two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor, but this time with a tragic but uplifting, reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film
<br /><br />- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www
With the death of her infirmed husband, May, an older woman faces a future in an urban world that views her as invisible, dead from the neck down, and unwelcome in the pseudo- sophisticated yuppie homes of her son, Bobby and his shallow wife, Helen, and Paula, a self- absorbed, clinging, and minimally talented daughter
The central family is anything but warm, supportive, and understanding of her new and tragic stage in life with the death of her husband
The Mother is a quiet character study that points up how in some societies, the elder parent is both unwelcome and a burden to grown children whose careers and status seeking overshadow all else
<br /><br />As May comes to realize the world is still important to her, the lonely widow finds her libido reawakened and alive with her daughter's boyfriend, a carpenter and rough sort
May embarks on an uninhibited sexual affair with Darren whose character is sympathetic to her at first, but his flawed nature is quickly revealed through the pressures of the women who surround him
<br /><br />This is the kind of role Hollywood actresses of a certain age whine is never written for them, but would never appear in because the film's frankness, overt sexuality, unglamorous wardrobe, little makeup, and social commentary on the vapidness of the very society most film industry women are enchrenched
The performance by the lead actress, Anne Reid ranges from quiet to giddy and her interpretation blossoms on screen from the drab widow to a sexually alive and freed middle age woman without face-lift, hair extensions, and liposuction
She bares more than her soul for the screen
<br /><br />Daniel Craig is the enabling handyman, Derrek who beds both mother and daughter
He turns in another stellar performance that is at first sympathetic to the widow's situation, but in the end is without redemption as his true nature unfold and he is literally the rooster in a hen-house
His aimless character's inability to say no to the ex-wife, boring girlfriend, and her mother is blamed as the root of his ineffectual existence
While good with his hands at building a conservatory, he is unable to construct meaning in his life
<br /><br />One of the best films from Britain in years, it is simply adult in its storyline
The Mother is the rare kind of film that is perhaps too honest for American audiences to tolerate having no car chase, no bling, no rap soundtrack to drown out the cretin performances by TV starlets and buff studmuffins
The Mother reflects how the aging baby boomers are now disposable people that offspring are willing to overlook, send to the retirement home, and get out of the way
May doesn't know what to do as she is made alive by Darren, isn't willing to go to the old folks home, and finds her kids are more conservative than she ever was at their age
I lived during those times and I think the program caught the heart of the era
I do think it should have dealt with more of the Afro American issue but I think it cover a lot in the program
It was scary to sit and watch the riots on T V hoping that they would not go as far as your families home and that it would not get burnt down
I thought Jerry O'Connell did a great job portraying a vet coming back from the war
Some had changed more than others and some not so much
It bothers me when someone comments that an issue was not covered enough or it was not entertaining enough
I thought the movie was great and that everyone in it did a remarkable job
Thank you for a trip (sad and good) down memory lane
I'm going with the 1-0 on this and here's why
In the last few years, I have watched quite a few comedies and only left with a few mild laughs and a couple video rental late fees because the movies were that easy to forget
Looked interesting, wasn't expecting much though
This was probably one of the funniest movies I have ever had the chance to watch
Dave and Andrew make a great comedic pair and the humor was catchy enough to remember, but not over complex to the point of missing the joke
I don't want to remark on any of the actual scenes, because I do feel this is a movie worth seeing for once
With more and more pointless concepts coming into movies (you know, like killer military jets and "fresh" remakes that are ruining old classics), This movie will make you happy to say it's OK to laugh at "Nothing"
When I was very young,on a local tv station,they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on Saturdays
I saw great flicks like Crippled Masters,Blind Fist of Bruce,Kung Fu Zombie,Shaolin Drunken Monk,Rage of the Master,Tattoe Dragon,and
Me and my dad had just gotten lunch at Burger King
We were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday
We ran in the house and jumped onto the couch,turned on the set and flicked it onto 56
The usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words Kung Fu Saturday over it
Then under that was the Title of the film
I bit into my burger amused with the pre-credit sequence
The plot was hard to follow at that age but that wasn't what lured me
I moaned every time a commercial came on and soon the 2 hours of the best movie i have ever seen ended
I first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and didn't really think it was anything particularly special
AS time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film, which i will come to later
For a while i left this film alone and didn't watch it for a while
When looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago (now being 15), I dug out the VHS of homeward bound
After watching this i was left on a natural high that i couldn't really explain
The film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect
The films nature of three completely different animals collaborating together to find their way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are you can always find common ground, something that you all need
The way the personalities of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic
In that you have an old knowledgeable wise golden retriever, looking after or guiding 'chance' the fun loving if slightly clumsy young American bulldog, with sassy the clever, vulnerable but confident cat
The film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible it creates magic in that you start to believe that this journey can happen
<br /><br />I don't want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to films i assure you i am quite the opposite, but the most uplifting part of this film is without a doubt shadows return, when shadow desperately tries to escape and chance and sassy, painfully are told by him to leave
When both animals return to their beloved owners there is a silence until shadow limps over the horizon to the awe of all
There is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15
This film may not be Lord of the rings but for Disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to uplift myself in the way it does even at this age it deserves 10/10
My cable TV has what's called the Arts channel, which is a "catch-as-catch-can" situation sometimes, sometimes films, sometimes short clips of films or ballets, and I came into this just as the bar scene came on, where they tear up their coupons
Excellent, exquisite, Ealing wins again, my wartime-Glasgow-raised mother would love this, should I ever find a copy of it
Some of Britain's best artists, from Mr Holloway to Wayne and Radford and the delicious Miss Rutherford, having a wonderful time gently sticking it to the Home Office
Loved the last scene, where as soon as they are "back in England!" the temperature plummets and it rains
I felt this movie was as much about human sexuality as anything else, whether intentionally or not
We are also shown how absurd and paradoxical it is for women not to be allowed to such a nationally important event, meanwhile forgetting the pasts of our respective "advanced" nations
I write from Japan, where women merely got the right to vote 60 years ago, and female technical engineers are a recent phenomenon
Pubs in England were once all-male, the business world was totally off-limits for women in America until rather recently, and women in China had their feet bound so they couldn't develop feet strong enough to escape their husbands
Iran is conveniently going through this stage in our time, and we get a good look at how ridiculous we have all looked at one time or another
Back to the issue of sexuality, we are made to wonder what it may be intrinsically about women that make them unfit for a soccer game (the official reason is that the men are bad)
Especially such boyish girls, a couple so much so that you even get the feeling that lesbianism is on the agenda as well
I think one point is that not all women are the same, and the women the police are trying to "protect" are not the ones who would try to get in in the first place
The opening scenes of the approach to the stadium makes you appreciate the valor of the young women trying to get in -- and each one separately -- at all
Any woman brave enough to try to go should be allowed! The world of sexuality is not one-size-fits-all
<br /><br />Meanwhile, the apprehended criminal girls bond inside the makeshift pen awaiting their deportation to who-knows-where, and in a much more subtle way, begin to bond with the guards keeping watch over them
These had definite ideas about women and femininity, which were being challenged head-on
The change in attitude is glacial, but visible
<br /><br />Since the movie is pure Iran from the first moment, it takes a little easing-into for the foreigner, but the characters have a special way of endearing themselves to you, and you end up getting the whole picture, and even understanding the men's misunderstandings and give them slack
The supposed villain is the unseen patriarchy of the Ayatollahs, which remain unseen and unnamed, and likely unremembered
<br /><br />Knowing that this movie was filmed during the actual event of the Iran-Bahrain match gives me a feeling of awe for all involved
Everyone plays their part pretty well in this "little nice movie"
Belushi gets the chance to live part of his life differently, but ends up realizing that what he had was going to be just as good or maybe even better
The movie shows us that we ought to take advantage of the opportunities we have, not the ones we do not or cannot have
If U can get this movie on video for around $10, it´d be an investment
I remember seeing this movie when I was about 7; and at the time it shocked me
I had seen a violent movie before, but I never saw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence
This movie not only shows this, but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness
What this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful
Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had a built-in anti Asian bias) and to come at it from a morally superior position
Grand Canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash
The ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up
While Grand Canyon simply ends on a quiet note, where you know nothing much will change in the character's lives but that's because life just goes on too, there's no suitable ending
There is no ending of a chapter to begin another
Don't know if this contains any spoilers or not, but I don't want to risk being blacklisted until the year 3462
<br /><br />I disagree entirely with the viewer comments that have described *Guns, Germs and Steel* as "politically correct" and "neo-Marxist
" They cannot have watched the same series that *I* did
<br /><br />The series *I* watched depicted the history of European colonisation in the Americas and southern Africa with no particular inaccuracies
I saw nothing in the series that portrayed Europeans as bad people who happened to be lucky, though Europeans often *were* lucky - and there's nothing wrong with luck
Neither did I see native peoples portrayed as poor little innocent things
If anything, the Inca was rather arrogant - as you would expect any leader would be when dealing with foreigners, if his country has not been conquered in living memory by any other world power
<br /><br />I certainly saw nothing that could be construed as Marxist or Neo-Marxist, except by the most incredibly elastic of imaginations
<br /><br />Otherwise, many African peoples *do* have a built-in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that Europeans lack
At the time they were at the height of their successes, the Aztec, Maya and Inca civilisations *were* as advanced as any other in the world - and as wealthy; sometimes more so
Aboriginal American and Khoi-San populations *were* decimated by smallpox and other diseases introduced by Europeans; just as European colonists were decimated by tropical diseases like malaria
(NOTE: The Khoi-San peoples are completely different from all other sub-Saharan African peoples
) <br /><br />So, I don't see what some of the other commentators are complaining about
The only thing *I* can find to complain about is that the series doesn't tell me anything I did not know by the time I finished seventh grade
There's really nothing new in the way of historical information in this film
It does, however, present some nice dramatisations of events, such as the conquest of the Incas; the production values are very high; and it fills in a few holes here and there that didn't get covered in Mrs
Gruber's Sixth Hour Social Studies Class at Milan Middle School
<br /><br />If you rent or buy this, assuming you had a decent primary and/or secondary school education, you won't learn anything new, but you will have an enjoyable and entertaining time reviewing what you already learned (or should have learned) by the time you hit high school
Textbook example of an underestimated movie
<br /><br />Although one can watch this movie over and over again and laugh every single time and still see something new in it, it's still regarded as just another funny picture
And although the movie has inspired many and added it's quotes and images to the pyche of all it's viewers, Moon Over Parador still hasn't received the acclaim it should
Even the brilliant cast with Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia, to mention one, is not able to change this perception
<br /><br />But after watching Raul Julia as Roberto Strausmann make Richard Dreyfus an offer he can't refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a good review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion: this stuff is timeless! In fifty years we will have the proof
This is a great movie but there could be more about Soylent Green
There should be more scenes of what they do to people
I think it would be neat to see if all this does happen in the year 2022 and beyond
Even if you still know what the secret is it is a great movie
For anyone who may not know what a one-actor movie was like, this is the best example
This plot is ridiculous, and really makes no sense
It's full of cliched situations, hackneyed lines, melodrama, comedy
you name it!<br /><br />But Amitabh Bachchan can make anything convincing, and this movie is by no means an exception
Everyone turns in a decent performance - Shashi Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smita Patil
But it is the Megastar who overshadows everyone with his towering presence
Without him, this movie would have been a non-starter
The story is about separation / mistaken identities / misunderstandings / love / hate / loyalty / good vs evil - everything, really! Amitabh's is a brilliant performance on all counts, in an otherwise silly film! And did I mention that it is ridiculously funny
Reading the various external reviews of Roger Ebert and other well-known film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much I love this movie, even though I only have a dubbed-into-Japanese video version of it
<br /><br />Apparently, many critics seem to take it as a minus that the story premise has been used before, most famously in the very great "It's a Wonderful Life
" To me, a great premise is a great premise no matter how many times it's used, and I'd be happy to see more movies using this particular premise--the discontented man who gets a chance to gain a fresh perspective on his own life through a bit of "divine magic
"<br /><br />I suppose folks and critics of a more intellectual bent are not as pulled into the story, but I don't go to movies to critique them with notebook in hand--I go to movies to throw myself into them and let them take me where they will
<br /><br />If you are sentimental sort like myself, you'll be well rewarded by seeing this picture
The performances are excellent throughout, and the movie was very well cast
Michael Caine is superb as the sympathetic bartender
Jim Belushi does a great job as an "average Joe" kind of guy who wonders if his life hasn't gone as it should
Linda Hamilton, always excellent, is again right on target here as the loving wife
Jon Lovitz entertains as usual, and even has some surprisingly moving moments in "Mr
Destiny" is not "It's a Wonderful Life," but who says it has to be? Taken on its own terms, "Mr
Destiny" is an enjoyable, well-made, funny, and moving film
I've seen my Japanese-dubbed video of it numerous times, and I'm sure I'll see it several more times
If that somehow makes me a "lowbrow," so be it! I'm just glad that I hadn't read any reviews of "Mr
<br /><br />I suppose I should have the courage of my convictions and give the movie nine or ten stars, but I couldn't help but doubt myself after reading all the critical reviews
Without doubt the best of the novels of John Le Carre, exquisitely transformed into a classic film
Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus' Czech Intelligence controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus' con-man father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' mentor, believer and British controller), together with the rest of the characters, are so perfect and natural, the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award
Even the small parts, such as Major Membury, are performed to perfection
It says a lot for the power of the performances, and the strength of the characters in the novel that, despite the duplicity of Magnus, one cannot help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of U
I have read the book at least a dozen times, and watched the movie almost as many times, and continue to be mesmerized by both
If I had one book to take on a desert island, A Perfect Spy would be the choice above all others
Because of all the negative reviews of this film I almost didn't watch it
However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was a fairly enjoyable horror movie
The acting wasn't great - apart from the wonderful Alice Krige - but some of the dialogue ("Just consider yourself lunch
<br /><br />On the whole an above average Stephen King effort - 7/10
I looked at this movie with my child eyes, and I wasn't disappointed
The story is well-known, some abandoned orphan has to be brought to his parents by an improbable trio (mamooth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal)
And I don't want to forget to mention the incredible small fury animal with his hazenut
This one really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture
<br /><br />Briefly : it works, it is funny and it is a "must-see" with your children (they'll like it)
"Girlfight" follows a project dwelling New York high school girl from a sense of futility into the world of amateur boxing where she finds self esteem, purpose, and much more
Although the film is not about boxing, boxing is all about the film
So much so you can almost smell the sweat
Technically and artistically a good shoot with an sense of honesty and reality about it, "Girlfight" is no chick flick and no "Rocky"
It is, rather, a very human drama which even viewers who don't know boxing will be able to connect with
The Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the Depression following almost ruined the American Musical Theater, in fact it was the final death blow to vaudeville
Those behind the curtains were hit as bad as those in front
<br /><br />In an effort to stimulate the show business economy and his own personal economy, out of work theater director James Cagney comes up with a brilliant idea
Stage live relevant prologues to the movies that are being shown at the various movie theaters that are springing up overnight from the old theaters
Some other competitors get wind of it and the competition is on
<br /><br />Footlight Parade is my favorite Busby Berkeley film
It gives James Cagney a chance to display some of his versatility as a dancer as well as a tough guy
In his retirement Cagney said that while he screened his few and far between musicals a lot, he could barely be bothered with some of his straight dramatic films
He wished he'd done a few more musicals in his career and I wish he had
<br /><br />Of course the staging of these Busby Berkeley extravaganzas on the stage of a movie palace defies all logic and reason
<br /><br />Dick Powell gets to sing three songs in Footlight Parade, Ah the Moon is Here, Honeymoon Hotel, and By a Waterfall, the last two with Ruby Keeler further cementing that screen team
Ruby sings and dances with Powell in the last two and she partners with James Cagney in my favorite number from Footlight Parade, Shanghai Lil
<br /><br />Joan Blondell is Cagney's no nonsense girl Friday at the theater
Like in Blonde Crazy, she's the one with the real brains in that duo and it's her quick thinking that bails him out of some domestic problems he has on top of his theatrical ones
<br /><br />Look for Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern in the chorus as per the IMDb pages for both of them
John Garfield is seen briefly in the Shanghai Lil number
And in a scene at the beginning of the film, producer Guy Kibbee takes Cagney to a movie theater where they are showing a B western starring John Wayne
But what's even more unusual is that the brief clip shows him in a scene with Frank McHugh who plays another Cagney assistant in Footlight Parade
I think the brothers Warner were playing a little joke there
I've got to believe that clip was deliberate
<br /><br />Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley at his surreal best
6 rating on IMDb about Johnny Dangerously at the moment I wrote this review and I thought I had to do something to promote that memorable piece of comedy as much as I can
Seriously, to get a rating so low, the people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor, not to mention a very shallow opened mind
If you don't like humorous flicks, don't watch them! Combining absurd humour, a very good storytelling, and an outstanding pace given by the multiple running gags, this movie has made its way into my DVD collection
And that is without mentioning the visual farces embedded here and there and of course, the use of "clin d'oeils" and "clichés" based on our favorite organized crime movies
<br /><br />I showed this movie to a lot of people and, being introduced to it without any specific expectations (except maybe watching a comedy)- the very state of mind you should have to watch any movie in my opinion - they all liked it very much
It goes well, it's not long to watch and there are absolutely no slowing downs in the evolution of the story, which I think is really straightforward
Sure it's not perfect, some gags fall a bit short, but no movie is perfect, especially when considering other opinions that yours
That is why I rated this movie 9 out of 10
This movie is in my opinion a precursor like "Top Secret" and "Spaceballs" in the field of absurd but well-thought comedies
Which are nowadays more and more absurd while cutting down on the thought and ingeniosity side
Sometimes gags need more culture than a lot of people imagine to be understood correctly, if at all
As a final word, I would like to say : watch it for yourself, do not follow average Joe's saying and if you don't like it, then you'll know for real it was not good for your tastes, which is understandable but unlikely in my opinion
There is a story (possibly apocryphal) about an exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the start of Twelve Monkeys
Gilliam (allegedly) produced a long list (think about the aircraft one from the Fifth Element) and handed it to Butch Bruce
It was entitled "Things Bruce Willis Does When He Acts"
It ended with a simple message saying: "please don't do any of the above in my movie"
<br /><br />There is a fact about this movie (definitely true)
Gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing
<br /><br />I would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success that is The Twelve Monkeys
<br /><br />Visually, the Twelve Monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a Gilliam film
It is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general (but magnificent) strangeness
Gilliam delights in wrong-footing his audience
Although the ending of the Twelve Monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real, Gilliam borrows heavily from Kafka in the clockwork, bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate
It is this journey, and the character developments they undergo, which unsettles
<br /><br />I love Gilliam films (Brazil, in particular)
But they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness
He seems to have so many ideas, and so much enthusiasm, that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess (Brazil, in particular)
I still maintain that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force, but there's no denying that The Twelve Monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the tight-plotting department
Style, substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the ex-Python
<br /><br />Whatever the truth of the rumour above, Gilliam also manages to get a first rate (and very atypical) performance out of the bald one
Bruce is excellent in this film, as are all the cast, particularly a suitably bonkers - and very scary - Brad Pitt
<br /><br />It's been over a decade since this film was released
When I watched it again, I realised that it hadn't really aged
And this made me look at the film with fresh eyes
This seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that, partly at least, is about reflections in mirrors, altered perspectives and the absurd one-way journey through time that we all make
It is a genre-mixture with ingredients of the Action-/Horror-/Romantic-/Comedygenre
Some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards
There is so much to discover in this story
The romantic relation between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts
The action is great which is no surprise, it is originating from Honkong, birthplace of the world's best action movies
The humour sometimes seems a little bit silly but in a good way
Somehow this movie is being able to balance the different moods and keeps being good
My kids recently started watching the reruns of this show - both the early episodes on the N, and the later ones on ABC Family - and they love it
(I wasn't aware the show had even lasted past the first or second season) I'm curious as to what prompted all of the cast changes - I've seen them described as "highly publicized," and yet a half hours searching efforts on the web have revealed nothing but endless comments on how the early episodes were so much better than the later episodes
(Personally, I don't see a whole lot of difference - the scripts and themes remain largely the same throughout - but they do lose some great people along the way) My daughter has put the DVDs on her wish list, so perhaps the land of special features and commentary will shed some light on all of this
I also wish they'd done some self-referential humor about the changes - like on "Boy Meets World" where they drop the little sister for an entire season or so, and when a different actor later shows up playing her, they ask her where she's been and she says "upstairs," or when early series token geek "Minkus" shows up for the high school graduation, they ask him where he's been and he says "over there," pointing to the part of the classroom never shown by the camera, before saying "Hey, Mr
Turner, wait up!" and running off screen (Mr
turner being another character who left) Oh well - maybe there will be an E true Hollywood story on this or something? I was just glad to see Aunt Hilda show up for the finale - she was always one of my favorites - it's too bad it couldn't have been a more encompassing cast reunion
(The Zelda candle just didn't cut it for me
This is a wonderful movie with a fun, clever story and the dynamics of culture differences and the running theme of what's important in life make this a very under-appreciated movie
Don't let the cynics of the world deter you from seeing this
Keaton has wonderful moments and I wonder at the fact that comedy is never appreciated, because actors like Keaton make going from humor to serious bits look tremendously easy
Being someone who lists Night of the Living Dead at number three in her top five favorite movies of all time, and at the same time loving this student film parody, I feel I must defend this movie against the previously posted scathing reviews
This short but sweet opus has always been a crowd-pleaser at horror and science fiction movie marathons where those who attend have a love of the genre yet know not to take zombie movies too seriously
This film is a tribute to the original, not an insult
It is intended to be funny, and many others who I have heard chant for and applaud it agree with me that it succeeds
Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD 50+ times
Watch for the director cameo as news reporter Jeff Drexel, and also if you have the opportunity catch his Alien parody, Loaf
Two thirds of nearly 2,000 IMDb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8, 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes (Was this a record, or merely a faulty VCR?)
Although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination
But for some reason I imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it
My mind was changed by Elizbeth Von Arnim's original book
My wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form
Such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things, but I gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing, although in no way syrupy, and was also very well written
I realised my wife would enjoy watching the film, and so decided to buy her the videotape
I am now very glad that I did, and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre-Mussolini Italian atmosphere
The story is set in the immediate post WW1 period and starts with two married London ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together, away from their families, in a rented villa in Italy
Force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds
Its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses, not only between these four very disparate mature ladies, but also with the occasional male visitor
If you want action, thrills, dramatic sex scenes, natural or man-made disasters, or Harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you
But IMDb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch, and if you care to give it a try you may, as I did, come to rank it among your much loved films
<br /><br />It is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which I am already familiar
In many cases I find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film, but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that I actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book, effectively unrolled before my eyes
(Perhaps Italy itself has some part in this, the last time I had this experience was when I was watching tales from Boccaccio's Decameron on TV
) Generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal, but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events
This works very well, although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story
Great credit is due to the Director, Mike Newell, and all members of the cast, particularly those well known British Actresses who play the four principal ladies
But the synchronized swimming was only a hook for the story of three girls in a Paris exurbia finding themselves
No question where Sciamma's sympathies lie as all the boys are depicted as "animaux" but actually only the 3 girls are in focus, and for the entire time, with the few adults and the other adolescents being mostly in the background
Marie is a stick of a girl, unattractive, but determined
She wants to be a swimmer and forces herself on Floriane ( a Renascence quality beauty per one reviewer) and she is also a friend of convenience to Anna: not unattractive, but for her, the time of her body's perfection was short, and now she is an adolescent in a women's body
What ensues is a journey to self-realization without a road map but there is a glumness about the three that is un-natural: where is the gaiety and mindless chatter of youth? While the dénouement was breath taking, with Floriane's self-absorption beautifully portrayed, as well as the equally beautiful union of Marie and Anne, it all seemed abstract, Sciamma's puppets
I recently purchased the complete American Gothic series on DVD and it lived up to my memories of it
I was very grateful to be able to view for the first time episodes that were never televised
I loved "Ring of Fire" in particular of the stories I hadn't seen the first time around
<br /><br />Gary Cole is fantastic as "evil, sexy" Lucas Buck
Lucas Black as Caleb is also a superb player
I thought Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombs was also superb in her portrayal
In fact, the whole cast was fantastically talented and had great chemistry with each other
<br /><br />It's a shame the series was screwed by the network (in collusion with a burgeoning group of censors) because it was truly designed for adult viewing
A mixture of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, Gothic romance and horror genres, it offered brilliant characterizations supported by acting at the genius level
<br /><br />I had the most tremendous lust for the devil for once in my life
Long live Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the most luscious "fallen angel" ever
Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS Agent who practically gives the store away to everyone's surprise
What kind of IRS Agent is this?<br /><br />Most of us have all heard the line by an IRS Agent, "Hello, I'm from the IRS
" Our smile then spreads into a chuckle that says, "Yeah, right
"<br /><br />As you get further and further into this story, you cannot figure this guy out
He goes easy on those who are being audited
What is his motive? Is he from another planet, an angel, a rich guy who wants to do good? He helps so much we want him to be our auditor should we get audited, of course
Hey, IRS, are you listening? (kidding, just kidding)<br /><br />The pace of the movie is perfect and so much so that clues were ignored that would have told me what was really going on
Intense, repeat intense, focus was on Ben and stays there
The whole movie only works because of Ben as we try to figure him out and I didn't see any clues (what clues you talking about, Willis?)
Not reading the box before watching the DVD movie was the better way to go here
By the end of the movie I finally put it all together
And, yes, it's over the top, but still a great story, mostly because of Will Smith
<br /><br />Will Smith should have been nominated for a Best Actor Award
The rest of the cast were very good as well
<br /><br />Yes, it's over the top and despite the great acting and when you finally get all the answers you must realize that the message of the movie is all wrong
What's the message? Believe me, you will won't need too many clues to figure it out
Sex: Yes, but nothing to get excited about
In THE BARBARIAN AND THE GEISHA, John Wayne plays Townsend Harris, a real envoy from the United States who was responsible for truly opening up Japan to International relations in the late 1850s
Before him, Commodore Perry basically pushed into Japan with gunboats and forced a treaty upon the Japanese in 1853
Harris, who arrived just a bit later, worked through the details and helped ensure compliance--as many of the Japanese felt no particular inclination to honor the first treaty
According to some other sources I found, the romance between Harris and a Japanese Geisha is mostly fiction and this romance is much of the focus of this film (hence, the title)
<br /><br />My first reaction the first time I saw this movie was one of surprise
John Wayne as a diplomat?! When he's being diplomatic in most films, he says please and thank you as he pummels people!!!! So seeing him playing a man who is NOT a man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game seemed very odd indeed
In fact, I can't think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role
By the way, I've seen photos of Harris and Wayne has practically no resemblance to him at all
<br /><br />However, despite the story taking a lot of liberties with the truth and the strange casting, the film is still very watchable
The color cinematography is nice, the film shows some nice insights into Japanese customs and culture and the acting isn't bad
All in all, a likable and watchable film despite it's odd casting
<br /><br />PS--Read through the trivia for this film
You find out a bit more about the real life characters as well as a supposed fight between Wayne and the director (John Huston) where Wayne apparently knocked him out!! Based on what I've read about Huston and the way he got along with actors, this is an incident I tend to believe
And, it's also a nice example of John Wayne "diplomacy"
Most people, when they think of expressionist cinema, look to the b&w German films of the silent and early sound eras--films that emphasized canted angles, extreme contrasts of light and dark, exaggerated performance, and occasional uses of surrealism to create a dreamlike atmosphere in order to diverge from traditional, naturalistic modes of cinematic representation
If we're willing to accept that the Germans were not the only filmmakers to create expressionist cinema (and that those above-mentioned characteristics are not prerequisites for expressionist film), then I would argue that Dodes'ka-den (DKD) is a prime example of this type of film
<br /><br />Like Dreams, DKD is a little unhinged for a Kurosawa film, dabbling, as it does, in the unreal
However, DKD is also, unlike Dreams, a great film and probably my favorite Kurosawa picture
This was, I believe, Kurosawa's first color film, and the man saturates the movie with vibrant primary colors, creating a completely unreal contemporary Japan
We are used to the neon lights and gleaming Tokyo skyscrapers; we are not used to a city that appears to have been colored with crayons
<br /><br />DKD is, as I said, a peculiar film inasmuch as many of its characters live in a junkyard, appearing to live in an alternate universe
That is, I think, the point--these are the Tokyo outsiders, the people left behind during the great move forward following World War II
The film also represents one of Kurosawa's more heartfelt movies; there is genuine sentiment here and genuine pathos (such as when the boy's father describes their dream home)
It's an amazingly moving film from a man better known for stunning, John Ford-like vistas and samurais
Everyone should have known Kurosawa had in him a movie as touching and thought provoking as this (Ikiru foreshadows the emotional resonance of this film in many ways)
<br /><br />I will also argue, to the last, that this is Kurosawa's greatest achievement
His samurai films, though capable pictures, pale in comparison to works by Kobayashi (Hara-kiri is the greatest, most intelligent samurai film committed to celluloid)
Rashomon, Hidden Fortress, Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Sanjuro, Kagemusha, and Ran are all fine films, but they're merely good (and, frankly, I think that word is too generous for Hidden Fortress and Kagemusha)
They are the crown jewels that show Akira was not a one-trick samurai pony
They reveal his artistry and mastery of cinema
I love this movie, but the music at all the alumni gatherings is just stupid
<br /><br />The fateful game took place in 1972
That means that the protagonists graduated in 1972
But almost all of the music played at the dances etc
<br /><br />Having just attended my 30th high school reunion, I can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance of former high school people is their parents' music
<br /><br />I understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970s music -- we all know what a desolate time it was musically
But it wasn't completely bereft, and the producers of the film should have taken more care
I found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film
<br /><br />This was a bad director and/or producer decision
A typical Clausen film, but then again not typical
Clausen writes, directs and play one of the leading roles
This is really a great film about normal people living normal lives trying to make the best of it
<br /><br />Sonja Richter plays a nurse that really is an actor, but it turns out that she is the best nurse to take care of the old man
<br /><br />Everybody has problems and those who nobody believes in ends up being happy
But nothing good comes easy, they have to fight to win their life and love
This is just a short comment but I stumbled onto this movie by chance and I loved it
The acting is great, the story is simple and touching, and the lines, especially from the 4-yr-old Desi, are so cute and sad
It's a rehash of many recent films only this one has fewer stars, lesser complications and a more fuzzy feel to it
Abhay and Ritika (played by Fardeen Khan & Esha Deol respectively) meet at a friend's wedding where their own marriage (unbeknowst to them) begins its process of being arranged
Within no time the two strangers are married and sent of to a honeymoon camp where they meet other couples going through the motions similar to theirs
As they spend time together, secrets are revealed, hearts broken and/or mended and love blossoms
<br /><br />If you've seen Honeymoon Private Limited and/or Salaam-e-Ishq, then you've seen this film
The plot twists are the same, there is not a single element of surprise in the entire two and a half hours of the film
I only enjoyed it because I had seen 'Darling' (also starring the leads Deol & Khan) earlier in the day and enjoyed their chemistry in that so I said "why not" when my sister suggested we rent 'Just married' as well
<br /><br />See it: Because Kirron Kher co-stars and is her usual darling self in it
<br /><br />Skip it: Because you've had enough of all this couple-fest nonsense! <br /><br />C
Only a 9/10 from me, a perfect ten would have been if there was more of a plot to the movie, but nevertheless Moonwalker to this day remains a fun fest of music, dance and entertainment
Beginning with the montage of video clips from Jackson's long career, it reminds the viewer of just why he is often regarded as 'The King of Pop'
From his hit 'I want you back' to 'We are the World' the multi-award winning charity record for the benefit of Africa
Following this a short movie of sorts, although lacklustre in an Oscar winning script, nonetheless provides a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience
Ending with a perfect (sexy!) rendition of 'Come Together'
Something the whole family can watch and enjoy
At first this looked like a boring comedy like The Odd Couple, but when I got into it it turned out to be a really funny film
Basically forgetful ex-comedians Willy Clark (Golden Globe winner, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (Oscar winning, and Golden Glove nominated George Burns) were a great comedy duo, and a brought back together to revive their hospital sketch for a TV show
Willy's nephew, Ben Clark (Golden Globe winning Richard Benjamin) is confident they can get together again with no hard feelings for each other, how wrong he is
They cannot get on all the time, they are both forgetful, especially during conversation, but they do it eventually
Also starring Lee Meredith as Nurse in Sketch (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuise as Mrs
Doris Green, Al's Daughter, Rosetta LeNoire as Odessa, Willy's nurse and Muppets from Space's F
I think the best line of the film is Burns mentioning that Matthau called him "a son of a bitch bastard"
It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted From Other Material, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay
the government that he fought to establish to recognize his loyalty with a promised and much needed pension
Ripstein's lyrical work is a sweet ode to all those who, like the Colonel, suffer under the abuses of a cynical and hardened society that strengthens itself by denying its citizens the means to live with dignity and purpose
Unlike the absurdity of WAITING FOR GODOT, the Colonel's wait for the arrival of his pension gives hope and significance to his otherwise miserable life
Two things in the film drive the Colonel who is masterfully played by Fernando Lujan; the hope that his military pension will one day arrive and the knowledge that his son, Agustin, died for a noble cause, a reason other than a drunken fracas at a rigged cockfight
Unable to realize the former, and forced to prove to the world the latter, the Colonel does the only thing he can do, set about training his son's fighting cock
The cock is now the warrior who can bring fortune and justice to the Colonel and his asthmatic wife, but his fighting ring is that of the killer of his former owner, Agustin
In a tense scene of confrontation between the Colonel and Nogales, his son's killer, the Colonel is offered by Nogales, a paid government agent, money enough to equal the Colonel's full pension
But, this is blood money; hush money designed to hide the fact that those in power have turned their backs on one who fought for their political ideals, and to conceal to the world that the warrior colonel's son was assassinated because he wrote for an underground paper that favored the rights of labor unions and the common man
With maximum dignity, the Colonel rejects Nogales' offer, picks up his fighting rooster and walks away as nobly as his old legs can carry him
Once he is at home, Dona Lola, his scolding wife, wants to know why the Colonel refused the money when both of them are starving
In response to her continued question, "What are we going to eat until November (when the cockfighting season begins)", the Colonel responds, "Shit
" Excrement is what the poor and disenfranchised have been eating all of their lives, and excrement is a meal that the Colonel willingly chooses to eat with dignity, knowing that he could never sell his soul to those who oppress him
The Colonel waits as the only man of honor and valor in a world without principles
Well, I'd heard from somewhere that Ossessione is a precursor to the Italian film genre, and particular favourite of mine, the 'Giallo'
but actually, aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in Italy; the two have pretty much no relation
In the sixties and seventies, Italian film-makers would get themselves a reputation for ripping off just about every successful American film released
They've not done that here, but Ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later American film 'The Postman Always Rings Twice', without giving the book's author, James M
Cain, so much as a credit! Anyway, the plot focuses on Gino Costa, a handsome drifter who, by chance, stumbles upon a café where a woman named Giovanna Bragana works
He soon learns that she's married to Giuseppe; a big fat annoying man, whom Giovanna can't stand to have even touching her
He wants the pair of them to run away together, but she's not so keen on the idea
However, fate ends up intervening and her plan to have her husband murdered is successful
<br /><br />Despite the fact that the film loses some credibility for not crediting the author whose story it's based on, it has to be said that director Luchino Visconti implements the film noir style well, and in a way I even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger American noir classics
The story is, as you would expect, extremely strong and the Visconti manages to pull good performances out of his cast
Visconti drags the film out a little bit too much, however, and with a running time of almost 135 minutes, I felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length
I almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at Ossessione as it IS a good film, but it's not a 'great' film
The relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly, and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters' heads
There's not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what's going on, and by not always focusing on the characters themselves; the film is not as interesting as it could have been
Still, it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason
although it's not as good as the 1946 version of the same James M
Blood Castle (aka Scream of the Demon Lover, Altar of Blood, Ivanna--the best, but least exploitation cinema-sounding title, and so on) is a very traditional Gothic Romance film
That means that it has big, creepy castles, a headstrong young woman, a mysterious older man, hints of horror and the supernatural, and romance elements in the contemporary sense of that genre term
It also means that it is very deliberately paced, and that the film will work best for horror mavens who are big fans of understatement
If you love films like Robert Wise's The Haunting (1963), but you also have a taste for late 1960s/early 1970s Spanish and Italian horror, you may love Blood Castle, as well
<br /><br />Baron Janos Dalmar (Carlos Quiney) lives in a large castle on the outskirts of a traditional, unspecified European village
The locals fear him because legend has it that whenever he beds a woman, she soon after ends up dead--the consensus is that he sets his ferocious dogs on them
This is quite a problem because the Baron has a very healthy appetite for women
At the beginning of the film, yet another woman has turned up dead and mutilated
Ivanna Rakowsky (Erna Schürer) has appeared in the center of the village, asking to be taken to Baron Dalmar's castle
She's an out-of-towner who has been hired by the Baron for her expertise in chemistry
Of course, no one wants to go near the castle
Finally, Ivanna finds a shady individual (who becomes even shadier) to take her
Once there, an odd woman who lives in the castle, Olga (Cristiana Galloni), rejects Ivanna and says that she shouldn't be there since she's a woman
Baron Dalmar vacillates over whether she should stay
She ends up staying, but somewhat reluctantly
The Baron has hired her to try to reverse the effects of severe burns, which the Baron's brother, Igor, is suffering from
<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Baron's brother appears to be just a lump of decomposing flesh in a vat of bizarre, blackish liquid
And furthermore, Ivanna is having bizarre, hallucinatory dreams
Just what is going on at the castle? Is the Baron responsible for the crimes? Is he insane? <br /><br />I wanted to like Blood Castle more than I did
As I mentioned, the film is very deliberate in its pacing, and most of it is very understated
I can go either way on material like that
I don't care for The Haunting (yes, I'm in a very small minority there), but I'm a big fan of 1960s and 1970s European horror
One of my favorite directors is Mario Bava
I also love Dario Argento's work from that period
But occasionally, Blood Castle moved a bit too slow for me at times
There are large chunks that amount to scenes of not very exciting talking alternated with scenes of Ivanna slowly walking the corridors of the castle
<br /><br />But the atmosphere of the film is decent
Director José Luis Merino managed more than passable sets and locations, and they're shot fairly well by Emanuele Di Cola
However, Blood Castle feels relatively low budget, and this is a Roger Corman-produced film, after all (which usually means a low-budget, though often surprisingly high quality "quickie")
So while there is a hint of the lushness of Bava's colors and complex set decoration, everything is much more minimalist
Of course, it doesn't help that the Retromedia print I watched looks like a 30-year old photograph that's been left out in the sun too long
It appears "washed out", with compromised contrast
<br /><br />Still, Merino and Di Cola occasionally set up fantastic visuals
For example, a scene of Ivanna walking in a darkened hallway that's shot from an exaggerated angle, and where an important plot element is revealed through shadows on a wall only
There are also a couple Ingmar Bergmanesque shots, where actors are exquisitely blocked to imply complex relationships, besides just being visually attractive and pulling your eye deep into the frame
<br /><br />The performances are fairly good, and the women--especially Schürer--are very attractive
Merino exploits this fact by incorporating a decent amount of nudity
Schürer went on to do a number of films that were as much soft corn porn as they were other genres, with English titles such as Sex Life in a Woman's Prison (1974), Naked and Lustful (1974), Strip Nude for Your Killer (1975) and Erotic Exploits of a Sexy Seducer (1977)
Blood Castle is much tamer, but in addition to the nudity, there are still mild scenes suggesting rape and bondage, and of course the scenes mixing sex and death
<br /><br />The primary attraction here, though, is probably the story, which is much a slow-burning romance as anything else
The horror elements, the mystery elements, and a somewhat unexpected twist near the end are bonuses, but in the end, Blood Castle is a love story, about a couple overcoming various difficulties and antagonisms (often with physical threats or harms) to be together
While traveling by train through Europe, the American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and the French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet each other and decide to spend the night together in Austria
On the next morning, Jesse returns to United States of America, and Celine to Paris
<br /><br />"Before Sunrise" is one of my favorite romances, indeed one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen
It is a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect, and the dialogs are stunning
The direction is amazing, transmitting the feelings of Celine and Jesse to the viewer
I have just completed my review number 1,000 in IMDb, and I choose "Before Sunrise" for this significant number because it is a very special film for me
I cannot understand why this movie was not nominated to the Oscar, with such a magnificent screenplay, direction and performances
Yesterday I have probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time, and I still love it
<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Antes do Amanhecer" ("Before Sunrise"
Gruveyman2 (comment below)you are a complete idiot
blinded by ignorance by the very city you have allegiance to
Its that whiny arrogance, that you are ironically claiming the film exudes about SF, that makes you seem like such the typical LA A**hole! The only reason you felt the film was so self congratulatory about SF is because you are jealous
Of course you don't know it because you are so LA jaded
First of all the film was completely factual about a beautiful city; what has been filmed there and what has been filmed by some of its more famous locals
It says nothing bad about LA; and these accomplished directors choose to live in a beautiful city over LA
They recognize that they went to film school in LA and are obviously proud of that fact
They recognize that SF is close to LA which is a benefit
The only negative thing that was said that relates to LA, was about the studio executives
The same studio executives that hated these guys movies when they first saw them, but then those same movies went on to be huge world-wide grossing films
So why wouldn't they have animosity towards the studio executive establishment and studio system? These are the only people they are trying to "disassociate from" and for good reasons! Don't be so sensitive! How can you say that Francis Ford Coppola is the "so called" San Francisco director? How is he not to be considered that? And who directed The Godfather? Coppola did
It was his vision that told the story on the screen that won it a best picture award
So what who gave him the job? He admits it in the documentary that he didn't even want to do the movie
so what's your point? And so what if Sophia wants to live in LA? And that proves your point how? And tell me how they are not truly independent when they are funding a lot of their own movies
And, when they made movies from studio funding, one, it was LA that came to them and said we want you to make these pictures and two, they used the money that they made from doing these pictures to fund their own
<br /><br />"Your bitchy and self congratulatory whining would take on an air of greater self respect and credence if you never set foot on the ground you so claim to be superior to in this film
"<br /><br />How the hell can "bitchy-ness" and "self-congratulation" suddenly have an "air" of self respect and credence
if they never go to LA again? What a stupid and senseless comment! You inserted some big words in there
and just don't know how to use them! And, by the way, they never claimed nor implied they were superior to LA! So what if they are giving a guy from New York an award in LA
again what the hell is your point? So if they go to LA or New York they are hypocrites by simply preferring to live in SF? You make no sense
<br /><br />San Francisco is proud of itself and its heritage and the people who make it what it is today
For you to take the time and type up such nasty comments about the city (not the movie! But the city and its people) only proves what it is we Northern Californians hate about people from LA! THIS IS A GREAT DOCUMENTARY
VERY INTERESTING, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE FROM THE BAY AREA
I really enjoyed the performances of the main cast
The director has developed performances where the characters are not one dimensional
A complex story with the changing between eras
Also appreciated the underlying story of the unions losing power and the effect of a large employer closing on a small town
I do not agree with the comment that the older man has to be attractive
There have be many relationships with older men and younger women - without the male being good looking
Depth of character can be appealing to the not so shallow
The film has a good look and the cinematography is also good
Esther Kahn is a young Jewish woman living in an overcrowded, Jewish Ghetto in 19th century England
She is surrounded by looming, oppressive, dreary, featureless, worn brick architecture, narrow sidewalks and streets, blacked out windows, and hordes of black-and-brown jacketed crowds
<br /><br />She lives in a tiny apartment with her large family whom operate a clothes shop within the apartment
As child, she worked, had no privacy, wore colourless clothing, shared a bed, and remained silent to avert the mockery of her mother and siblings who ridiculed her for mimicking them out of boredom
<br /><br />As a young woman, her life remains the same - she has no privacy, lives in a state of mental and physical hebetude and lethargy and inertia, exudes a blank, featureless expression, is clothed in plain, unremarkable clothing, and is continuously oppressed and dwarfed by the grey, mundane, massively imposing buildings, and narrow streets, and narrow hallways, and narrow doorways, and her loud-mouthed mother and siblings, and the prosaic, banal lifestyle of her family
<br /><br />Her only form of mental escape is the Yiddish theatre
Sitting in the balcony, front row, leaning over the rail, there is a vast space between her mind and the stage, a space that enables her to breathe, think, feel, and yearn
<br /><br />Yet despite the freedom of thought the open stage provides for Esther, her face and body remain torpidly somnolent, impassive, dispassionate
<br /><br />The plain and common looking Summer Phoenix brilliantly conveys Esther's emotionless demeanour - Summer/Esther does not convey any desire to want anything or anticipate anything
<br /><br />After an unusual explosive confrontation with her mother, Esther finally decides to break free from the bleak life she is trapped in
<br /><br />She is eventually cast in minor parts in a few stage plays, and meets Nathan Quellen, portrayed by quintessential British actor Ian Holm, who commences to teach Esther the technical skill of acting
<br /><br />From this point forward, Esther begins a grueling dual journey of learning how to act and learning how to feel
<br /><br />She begins experiencing emotions she never felt before, and she begins gaining the experience she needs to fully comprehend and wield the technical aspects of acting
<br /><br />Nathan walks her across the stage through the physical and emotional steps of surprise, hesitancy, anger, disgust, self-loathing, etc; she then begins walking through those emotions in her personal life
<br /><br />There are three truths, Nathan tells her - the truth of how a character reacts, the truth of how the actor would react, and the truth that a character and actor are not the same person
<br /><br />These technical steps and three truths slowly deconstruct Esther's defenses and lead her to two edifying experiences in the denouement of the film which mark the beginning of her freedom of thought, movement, and emotion
<br /><br />Esther Kahn is a technically challenging film to watch because of its odd and narrow camera shots, lackluster photo direction which conveys the realistic lackluster setting of the Ghetto, and Summer Phoenix's characterless and insipid and unappealing portrayal which brilliantly conveys Kahn's mental and physical hebetude and lethargy and lackluster nature
<br /><br />A must-see film for people who want to learn the technical craft of acting, and for people who appreciate minimalistic films and character studies
It's wacky, funny, violent, surreal, played out in a madman's head, and definitely not your usual comedy
<br /><br />If you don't find the film amusing then I guess it's just not for your tastes, so this is a tough one to write a review for
<br /><br />For reference, some other comedies I love are The Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride, and Zoolander (that one only got me the second time around)
There are others, but my taste is definitely for the unusual, and I am willing to accept that most people just don't tend to like that kind of thing
I make no apologies for having an unusual sense of humour - at least I have one
<br /><br />The scenes and characters of this particular movie are well put together, the verbal humour is hilarious, the situations are intriguing, the acting is very good (as you would expect of the cast), though the acting demands made of the cast by the script are not particularly high
The overall package makes for fun, funny, watchable yet violent entertainment
Easily the greatest low budget horror film of all time
I first saw this movie when I was around nine years of age, and I have to say that it scared the hell out of me
Now that I'm all growed up, however, I see this movie for what it really is
Everyone, or at least everyone with any taste, has dreamed of seeing a snowman going around killing people, even if they won't admit it
I have always found something genuinely frightening about snowmen, so naturally, for a horror junkie such as myself, thismovie was a dream come true
Some people say that this movie is silly, or otherwise void of any intelligence
it's a movie about a serial killer snowman, what the hell did you expect? Anyone who gave this film a low score is obviously too uptight to sit back and have a good laugh at stupid one-liners and cheap gore
I love this movie for what it is, a comedy, and until the movie industry wises up and makes a serious horror flick about a killer snowman (which seems impossible, unfortunately) I will forever hold this great piece of indie horror close to my heart
The film as entertainment is very good and Jimmy Stewart is excellent as Chip Hardesty, with well done co-starring turns by Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton
But the film, directed by legendary director Mervyn Leroy, was constantly vetted and script approval as well as every aspect of the film, down to clothing, was closely watched and controlled by J
Edgar Hoover didn't have something to be proud of
His management of the bureau from 1924 to his death crated on of the finest investigative services in the world
But by 1959 Hoover was already beginning to worry about being forced out and had already started to collect dossiers on powerful people to make sure and protect his little kingdom
And he was determined to make sure that no motion picture showed even a single wart about the bureau
The films shows only continued successes and glosses over the failures which occurred, and the bureau's part in the witch hunts of the early 1950's
Enjoy the story, but with tongue firmly in cheek
One of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt German expressionism, the highly atmospheric style of film-making developed during the 20s in Berlin
" (1920) and "Nosferatu, Eine Symphonie Des Grauens" (1922) were the most famous direct results of this movement, and while the movement didn't have a long life, its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today, specially in the horror genre
One of the key figures of this style would be director Paul Wegener, director of 1920's "Der Golem, Wie Er in die Welt Kam", as in his debut as a filmmaker, seven years before the making of that classic, he was already making experiments with expressionism in film
That early prototype of German expressionism was incidentally, another horror film: "Der Student Von Prag"
<br /><br />"Der Student Von Prag" ("The Student of Prague"), is the story of Balduin (Paul Wegener), a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in Prague, but who always find himself with financial troubles
One day, Balduin rescues the beautiful countess Margit (Grete Berger) from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident
Balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again, but soon he discovers that he'll have to compete with her rich cousin, Graf Von Schwarzenberg (Lothar Körner), who also wants to marry her
Knowing that he can't offer her much, Balduin wishes to be wealthy, and this is where a sorcerer named Scapinelli (John Gottowt) enters the scene
Scapinelli offers Balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room
Balduin accepts the proposal, only to discover in horror that what Scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirror
<br /><br />Loosely inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's short story "William Wilson" and the classic legend of "Faust", the story of "Der Student Von Prag" was conceived by German writer Hanns Heinz Ewers, a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature
Written at a time where cinema in Germany was still being developed as an art form, "Der Student Von Prag" shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes
Like most of the scriptwriters of his time, Ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater, although "Der Student Von Prag" begins to move away from that style
While a bit poor on its character development (specially on the supporting characters), Ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of Balduin
<br /><br />While "Der Student Von Prag" was Paul Wegener's directorial debut and Stellan Rye's second film as a filmmaker, it's very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly
Giving great use to Guido Seeber's cinematography, the two young filmmakers create a powerful Gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the German filmmakers of the following decade would do
Wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his "Golem" series from Seeber and Rye
Despite having very limited resources, Rye and Wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing (for its time) visual effect for the scenes with Balduin's reflection (played by Wegener too)
Already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film, Wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakers
<br /><br />As Balduin, Paul Wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie
It certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer, but one can't deny that Wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract
John Gottowt plays the sinister Scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove
Few is said about Scapinelli in the film, but Gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared
The rest of the main cast is less lucky, with Grete Berger being pretty much average as countess Margit, and Lothar Körner making a poor Graf Von Schwarzenberg
However, it must be said that Lyda Salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and Fritz Weidemann made an excellent Baron Waldis-Schwarzenberg, showing the dignity that Lörner's character should have had
<br /><br />Considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake (made 13 years after this film) is superior in every possible way, it's not difficult to understand why "Der Student Von Prag" hasn't stood the test of time as well as other early films
The movie's main problem is definitely its extremely low budget, as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what Ewers' story needed to be fully developed
This makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times, or even incomplete, as if there was something missing in the narrative (of course, there's also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete)
However, "Der Student Von Prag" is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that, while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time, left a powerful impression in history
<br /><br />As the direct predecessor of the German expressionist movement, it's hard to deny the enormous importance that "Der Student Von Prag" has in the history of German cinema, probably in the history of cinema in general
It may look dated even for its time, but considering the limited resources its director had, it's truly better than most films from that era
As the movie that started Paul Wegener's career, and with that German expressionism, "Der Student Von Prag" is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history
I never bothered to see this movie in theaters although I remember hearing the name over and over
I finally watched it this week and what a delight
For some reason, I was expecting it to not be very good so I was completely surprised when I sat down and stuck with it and then found myself completely pulled in
I read a lot of the other user comments and it impressed me how much people talk about her fighting in the ring, but what was wonderful about Diana is that she's a true fighter in life
All she needs to do is find her place where she be who she is and the ring helps her to get there
A very intelligent story and I'm amazed that this is the first time up for Michelle Rodriguez - what an excellent job she did
Adrian and her coach were also quite good
<br /><br />This film is a little rough around the edges, but it doesn't matter in the slightest
The story, the will, and the performances completely outweigh any flaws (that usually come with indie filmmaking anyway)
A compelling portrayal of a girl finding herself and triumphing over her circumstances and a K
After "A Dirty Shame", I never thought that I was going to see another John Waters movie
That movie was really so bad, that I was convinced that all his movies would be like that
But when the DVD of this movie was reviewed in a popular magazine and they said that this was an excellent movie, I decided to give it a try anyway
Only a couple of days later it was shown on television
I taped it out of curiosity and now that I've seen it, I can tell you that this "Pecker" sure is a lot better than "A Dirty Shame"
<br /><br />In this movie we see how a young 'nobody' from Baltimore becomes an overnight sensation in the art world of New York
He's a sandwich shop employee who photographs his weird family or things that he sees on the street as a hobby
When he keeps his very first 'exhibition' in the shop where he works, his pictures are noticed by a gallery owner who loves the pictures full of misery and weirdness
His photographs are sold for enormous prices, but when he sees how his family, friends and strangers react to his success he decides that he will no longer go to New York, they will have to come to him if they want to see more of him
And they do, but what they get to see there, is a bigger shock than they could ever imagine
<br /><br />It's not difficult to see why I loved this movie a lot more than "A Dirty Shame"
The first reason is that this movie has an actual story
This movie really has something to say and isn't just intended to shock as many people as possible
The fact that they make fun of the art world who considers everything out of the ordinary as art because they don't know what the reality is like, isn't just funny, it's not that far from the truth either
I guess there are many people who feel about modern art that way
Nobody understands why they are making such a fuss about it, but apparently we are all supposed to like it
The second reason why I liked this movie is because this one had much better acting performances to offer
I'm not saying that everything that you will see is great, but at least the characters have some meaning thanks to the performances of the different actors like Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci,
<br /><br />Overall this isn't a great movie, but thanks to its criticism and some good jokes - which never really go too far - this is an enjoyable movie
It certainly isn't the best comedy ever, but I liked it a lot more than "A Dirty Shame"
I thought the children in the show did a very good job
I especially enjoyed the performance of the Emma character
Well done! The stunts were pretty good for a low budget show
I was able to follow the movie and enjoy it without having to look at my watch every 5 minutes
I enjoyed the scenes with the tooth fairy and the burning of her
The ghostly apparitions of the children's souls being released was also good
Another good point of the movie is that it kept moving along
The adult leads were also believable and therefore helped to keep the show entertaining
All in all an enjoyable night of movie watching
This is truly one from the "Golden Age" of Hollywood, the kind they do not make anymore
It is an unique, fun movie that keeps you guessing what is going to happen next
<br /><br />All the actors are perfectly cast and they are all great supporting actors
This is the first movie I saw with Ronald Colman in it and I have been a fan of his ever since
Reginald Gardiner has always been a favorite supporting actor of mine and adds a certain quality to every movie he is in
While he played a different kind of character here, he still added something to the movie that another actor cast in this character would not have added
"They were always trying to get me killed," Alec Guinness once wrote of The Man In the White Suit's technicians
"They thought actors got in the way of things
" He went on to describe how he'd been given a wire rope to climb down and, assured it was safe, narrowly avoided serious injury when it suddenly snapped mid-descent
<br /><br />"People get in the way of things" might be a maxim tailor-made for White Suit inventor Sidney Stratton (fittingly played blank slate-fashion by Alec Guinness) in Alexander Mackendrick's definitive Ealing film of 1951
Certainly, he cares only about his work, its realisation - and sod the consequences
And similarly, with the exception of a couple of peripheral characters, there's almost nobody to root for in this chilly satire on capital and labour
<br /><br />Told in flashback, the film concerns Stratton's invention of a dirt-resistant, everlasting fibre (fashioned into the white suit of the title), and subsequent attempts by the clothing industry and its unions to suppress it
<br /><br />While the industry fears the bottom will drop out of the market, the shop floor stewards worry about finding themselves out of a job
Abduction and bribery attempts follow, with both money and an industry chief's daughter on offer (Daphne, the delectable, 4-packs-a-day-voiced Joan Greenwood), to the tragi-comic end
<br /><br />"What's to become of my bit of washing when there's no washing to do?" bemoans Stratton's landlady near the close
A notion Stratton hadn't even considered - and has disregarded again by the movie's ambiguous coda
<br /><br />A superior, if decidedly downbeat comedy, expertly performed - and pretty much answering the oft-raised question of whatever happened to the everlasting light bulb and the car that ran on water
`Castle of Blood' (aka `Castle of Terror') is a well-crafted, surprisingly spooky entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson
Exquisite black and white cinematography, flawless dubbing, superb casting, fairly logical scripting, deliberate pacing and a surprise (though totally appropriate) ending set this one apart
Only the films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt `love at first sight' between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivière) mar an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie
<br /><br />While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub, telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood
Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, requests an interview with Poe
During the course of the conversation, Poe reveals that all of his stories are true
Incredulous, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death
Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in Blackwood's castle, a night following Halloween when the dead walk
Alan cannot afford the bet, so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager
<br /><br />Unlike Mario Bava's overpraised `Black Sunday,' (aka `The Mask of Satan'), `Castle of Blood' is fairly restrained, making the few moments of violence even more dreadful, especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible Italian space movies from the 60s
<br /><br />It's a pity the only version of this film I've found is badly deteriorated (and recorded) pan and scan version
Even so, it is well worth seeing, and cries out for a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth
Watch it and enjoy a film that compares well with Robert Wise's `The Haunting'
I saw this movie being a Jane Austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels: well, this transposition is simply accurate, intelligent, delicate, careful, tactful, respectful, intense, in a word, perfect!<br /><br />"Emma" is one of Austen's most delightful and funny novels, thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters
The movie respected this subtle irony, not disregarding the comic element (Miss Bates above all)
What engaged me in the novel, and the movie renders it clearly, is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the English novelist, and the modern look with which women, men, and their relation are handled, and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the 18th century, who lived almost a secluded life, could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did: that most and still fascinates me
We can feel this modernity throughout the movie: just replace costumes, and use a more current language but the situations, the feelings, the ideas would be extremely modern
I think of the morbid interest in other people's lives, or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women's relations, and still the difficulty in revealing, and giving expression to one's feelings, especially love: every situation gets a universal and out-of-time value
<br /><br />The cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances: a young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suitable for this role (nowadays she would be probably too mature for it), Toni Colette is simply great
And how I envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear! And then, the breathtaking English countryside, where every situation gets such a magic and dream-like dimension
The movie starts something like a less hyper-kinetic, more pastiche Dead or Alive: strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers
But when a police officer is killed, one Tatsuhito gets involved
and when he discovers that his brother Shihito is also involved, things get bloody quite fast
<br /><br />An earlier work of Miike's, Shinjuku Triad Society is still filled with his usual in the ol' ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts, though it's not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces
Rather, it's a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction, as Tatsuhito digs his way through the underground, a maze that leads him to a gay Triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from Taiwan and keeps an almost-brothel of young boys (one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning)
Tatsuhito's brother is getting involved with said society, so Tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realm
<br /><br />What's mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship Tatsuhito has with his nemesis, Wang
Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, later moved back into Japan, and alienated for it
Wang is a Chinese who felt alienated in China, so killed his father and developed a crime wing in Japan
Wang also is a surprisingly Shakespearian character, which is weird enough as it is, much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with Tatsuhito comes to be
And Tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when he's forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother
While it would be rude to state that Miike's movies are successful mostly on their shock value, it is true that sometimes it's easy to lose track of how well Miike can create bitter, dis-impassioned characters
Yeah, I remember this one! Many years since I actually watched it
The story was entirely surreal, but nonetheless great! What anyone who rates and reviews movies ought to bear in mind is what the respective movie aims at
It's the same with "First Kid", which follows a similar pattern
Certain movies - like this one here - just aim at plain and comical nonsense
Such movies can't be rated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer
Of course these movies lack quality, lack a sophisticated storyline, very often lack first-class acting, but if they do fulfil their primary premise - that's okay
I don't have this movie here on my list of all-time favorites, but I still thought it was funny, had some very enjoyable sequences and made a good story
there should be a sub-genre in the Western called 'the Robert Mitchum Western'
Mitchum's brilliant, idiosyncratic, usually undervalued Westerns import his film noir persona to etch some compellingly dark character sketches, and bring an elegiac world-weariness more familiar from the films of Sam Peckinpah
Directed by Orson Welles protege Richard Wilson, it is a stark, monochrome beauty, full of chilling silhouettes and terrifying outbursts of savage violence, as Mitchum comes to tame a town terrorised by a monopolist with a private army
Mitchum's regression from soft-spoken stranger to deranged murderer, with a host of dark emotions in between, is a marvel of expressive, physical acting
I've never seen many online movies in most of my life, but if I'd pick any of them, I'd pick Spatula Madness, A clever reference to most movies like star trooper (etc
), using a camera, and wits of steel, Jason Steele mastered the art of turning a normal image into a painting, and then putting it all together with frame-by-frame animation to get a world inhabited by spatulas
the story begins at the middle, hows that for directors delight? then the middle is at the beginning, and so on, when I first watched it, I expected a soggy pixely look, but Jason, Like me, Loves looks, so took every detail to the max
although I don't recommend it for children, or would anybody besides me like it, but please search it up on the net (its a short film, look up film cow), its style reminds me of south park, but less violent
10 for the look, 6 for the laughs, and 6 for the story, it all comes to a 10/10, good work<br /><br />Jason Steele, I'm anxious to see the movie
The Ogre doesn't seem to have won itself a very good reputation since its release in 1988, and I guess a reason for that may be down to the fact that it was given the subtitle 'Demons 3' in order to help it sell better
Well, the film is directed by Lamberto Bava; the man behind the first two Demons films, and ogres and demons are somewhat alike (in that they're both 'monsters' anyway)
but other than that, this film has no connections to the other two films
It is, however, rather good! Italian filmmakers are famous for ripping off popular films, and while it's not completely obvious; it seems to me that this one has taken a fair bit of influence from Hellraiser
The plot focuses on a female horror writer who moves with her husband and son to a castle in Italy
She is haunted by memories from when she was a child and found an Ogre living in her basement
It's not long after moving into the castle before these visions return
and it may be more than just a coincidence as she comes to believe there's a murderous ogre living in the basement
<br /><br />The film was obviously shot on a budget and it was made for Italian TV, so it would be unrealistic to expect something brilliant; but for what it is, this is certainly a very decent horror film
Lamberto Bava may not have as keen an eye as his father Mario did; but he takes time in building up a foreboding atmosphere that really compliments the film well
The central setting, a large castle, makes the perfect place for a story like this to take place in and Lamberto makes the best of it; even if it does involve ripping off superior films at times; such as the Inferno-style pool scene
The plot itself is not quite as good as the atmosphere as several scenes are drawn out far too long and the relationship between the characters is rather strange (particularly between the husband and wife)
There's not a great deal of bloodshed, but Bava does get to do a little bit with the special effects
The ogre itself looks really silly and it's a good job that we don't get to see it very often
We do boil down to a fitting, if highly predictable, ending and overall I have to say that this film is much better than expected and comes recommended
I got to see the movie " On Thin Ice" on the television in India
I must say the movie was really well done, and really sent a chill down my spine
the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others still remain addicted
<br /><br />however, I felt that Diane Keaton was at her best
the scene where she has cravings, and begins rummaging her home for cocaine
the two boys are good, and Lynda Boyd also showed what a good actress she is
The script is well done as is the cinematography and direction
and casting<br /><br />A must must watch movie
I didn't at all think of it this way, but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title "Midnight Cowboy" was a gay porno
At that point, all I had known of it was the reference made to it in that "Seinfeld" episode with Jerry trying to get Kramer to Florida on that bus and Kramer's all sick and with a nosebleed
<br /><br />The movie was great, and surprisingly upbeat and not all pissy pretentious pessimistic like some movies I can't even remember because they're all crap
<br /><br />The plot basically consisted of a naive young cowboy Joe Buck going to New York trying to be a hustler (a male prostitute, basically), thinking it'll be easy pickings, only to hit the brick wall hard when a woman ends up hustling HIM, charging him for their sexual encounter
<br /><br />Then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, called "Ratso" by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time
You think of him as a scoundrel, but a lovable one (like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian) and surprisingly he and Joe become friends, and the movie is so sweet and heartwarming watching them being friendlier and such and such
Rizzo reveals himself to actually be a sad, pitiable man who's very sick, and very depressed and self-conscious, hates being called "Ratso" and wants to go to Florida, where he thinks life will be much better and all his problems resolved, and he'll learn to be a cook and be famous there
<br /><br />It's heartwarming watching Joe do all that he does to get them both down to Florida, along with many hilarious moments (like Ratso trying to steal food at that hippie party, and getting caught by the woman who says "Gee, well, you know, it's free
" and he says "Well if it's free then I ain't stealin' it", and that classic moment completely unscripted and unscheduled where Hoffman almost gets hit by that Taxi, and screams "Hey, I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here!"), and the acting is so believable, you'd never believe Joe Buck would grow up to be the distinguished and respected actor Jon Voight, and Ratso Rizzo would grow up to be the legendary and beloved Dustin Hoffman
It's not the first time they've worked together in lead roles, but the chemistry is so thick and intense
<br /><br />Then there's the sad part that I believe is quite an overstatement to call it "depressing"
Ratso Rizzo is falling apart all throughout the movie, can barely walk, barely eat, coughs a lot, is sick, and reaches a head-point on the bus on its way to Florida
He's hurting badly, and only miles away from Miami, he finally dies on the bus
The bus driver reassures everyone that nothing's wrong, and continues on
Sad, but not in the kind of way that'd make you go home and cry and mope around miserably as though you've just lost your dog of 13 years
And the soundtrack pretty much consists just of "Everybody's Talking'" played all throughout the movie at appropriate times
An odd move, but a great one, as the song is good and fits in with the tone of the movie perfectly
"The Groove Tube" was initially shown on video, in the first "video theaters" here in Boston
In one room, there were TV monitors on high stands, with old movie theater seats, in small groups facing the monitors
There were old refrigerators stocked with Pepsi, and baskets of York Peppermint Patties
In a second, smaller room, there were no seats, just large pillows
That act only added to the hilarity of the video
<br /><br />I was a 'frequent viewer'; the scenes I liked most and remember to this day are: Koko The Clown, The Kramp Family Kitchen (Kramp Easy-Lube Shortening), Safety Sam/ VD PSA, the Chevy Chase hitchhiker w/ nude runs through the woods, the Finger Ballet on what was eventually revealed to be the nude body of a woman
The last item was very reminiscent of the late, incredible Ernie Kovacs
Now, I've lost a lot of readers that are under 48 ("who is Ernie Kovacs??") but trust me, it's funny stuff
<br /><br />One reason I was a 'frequent viewer' was that I, and my friends, would bring other "Groove Tube" virgins to see it
We would sit and slyly watch the faces of the 'virgins' as the "Safety Sam" PSA would play
As the camera slowly zooms in on "Sam", we would wait for that "OH!" of recognition on the 'virgin's' face
Each time was more hilarious than the last
And then that 'virgin' would then bring a friend to see the show, repeating what we had done
To get this joke, you must watch the video
<br /><br />Yes, some of it is dated, but most plays, film, television, and now videos are
Just look at any video made in the 1980's
<br /><br />I did see "The Groove Tube" in a theater as a film, a grainy transfer from the original video
It had been cut, and was missing some of the original high-point scenes
<br /><br />The first "Saturday Night Live" show, featuring Chevy Chase, elicited instant remarks of, "that's the guy from "The Groove Tube" ", so it was a precursor for Chevy
<br /><br />I can't look at a can of shortening without hearing the voice-over, "coat your hands with a generous amount of Kramp Easy-Lube shortening
" and thinking of the "Kramp Holiday Loaf" recipe
Always gets me laughing in the Baking Needs aisle in the grocery store
<br /><br />The early 70's were parlous times; "The Groove Tube" was fresh, new, and really 'got' the humor of the times
It offered a 'hip generation', humor that wasn't available in any other format/medium
I got the first Bill and Ted movie for christmas and I had to get the second when I saw it in a store
This one was (I think) just as funny as the first but a much wierder story
It was funny how they had their own personnal hell and how they had to play death
The funny thing was that they played him in stupid little games like clue
The only thing I'd change is Station and Death being in the band but other than that it was great
The Secret of Kells is a film I've been waiting for for years after seeing some early footage at the Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny
I'm here to tell you now it's been worth the wait
The cartoons are heavily stylised but not annoyingly so as I'd feared
The whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination, I particularly love the animated illuminated book where the little figures come to life on the page
The characterisation is superb, I love Brendan Gleeson's voice as the stern Abbot and I especially liked the voice of the sprite Aisling
The forest is a triumph, such a beautiful place
The story is well realised, a mix of fact and fantasy
and really draws the viewer in to cheer on Brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the Book
I'm a lover of calligraphy and illumination anyway so the subject is close to my heart, but all the people I know who've seen this and are not fans of the craft agree that it's a lovely little film
I will definitely buy the DVD when it's released, and would like to say, well done Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project
:) Coming back in here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and gave them out at Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish them all the luck in the world at the Oscars, such a joy to see this nominated
Its no surprise that Busey later developed a tumor in his sinus cavity, this film is also a poor decision, but one I enjoyed fully
The first 5 minutes is the most uninspiring 5 minutes in any film; boring, bad dialouge, and then, with a Spiderman stance, Busey yells the best-worst line in any film ever created
"your worst nightmare butthorn!" I coughed up some of my egg nog laughing so hard
That line resonates so well, it even tops Clooney's infamous "hi Freeze, I'm Batman" line
Other classic moments is Busey constantly getting upset for people reminding him that he got his ex-CIA partner killed
which he did by accidentally shooting him in the chest (all made possible by a super slow-motion flashback sequence that makes watching paint dry seem exciting)
There's an ashtray to the nads, punches to the face, and a "that wasn't my fault and you know it!" Well, the footage shows him missing the bad guy and hitting his buddy, so
Other scream out-loud moments has to be his ex girl-friend dropping a grenade to the ground to enable his escape--a plan that defies all logic, physics, and absurdity
And lastly, when McBain jumps out of the Thunderblast during intense guerrilla warfare and starts to run and hurdles a small object, I almost wet myself
Some of Busey's best work by far, rent or buy it today "butthorn!" My vote is a perfect 10 (on the poo meter that is)
To like this movie at most you must be a)strongly in love (without a marriage) b) acknowledge English humor which is about admiring gallant and witty life situations and not just running gags c) be fairly very intelligent, because authors gave an opportunity to laugh and cry over every single minute of this movie, and only if you meet "b" and "c" requirements, you can recognize and enjoy author's input
d) to fully enjoy the movie you must love women like Kirsted Dunst, who is so natural, sweet and irresistible
e)you must admire creative, a little melancholic people with great and remarkable personalities<br /><br />if you meet all these requirements you'll be likely to rate this movie near 10 points
<br /><br />I never laughed half(!) as much as from watching this masterpiece
And i even managed to cry while laughing in some moments (i always get sensitive, whenever good things happen to Kirsten Dunst
Clint Tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter, tho he finds her, the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim
Whilst here, the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of Tollinger's reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer
As they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit, they hold a meeting that chooses to hire Tollinger to rid the town of it's unsavoury elements
<br /><br />Man With The Gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one, at the time of me writing this, it has just over 200 votes and a paltry 9 user comments written for it
It's a shame on either score because although the production values scream out that this is a B movie Western, this is a fine entry in the Western genre
That the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel, probably hasn't done the film any favours over the years, i myself read the synopsis and thought it's just another in the line of similarly themed pictures
Yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many enjoyable moments, both technically and as a functioning story
<br /><br />Robert Mitchum is in the lead as Tollinger, perfectly cast, he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace
We often talk about the screen presence that John Wayne and Charlton Heston had {justifiably of course}, Mitchum is right up there with the best of them
One sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place, we don't see his face, but we can feel that piercing brood staring out at us!
The rest of the cast are also very much in Mitchum's shadow, so really it's solely with the big man that the films acting credentials are high, perhaps it's unfair to single out Ted de Corsia for a kick, but Man With The Gun's minor failings are with its villains, and sadly de Corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace
The score from Alex North is excellently layered {fans of Spartacus will certainly be pricking their ears up} and the cinematography from Lee Garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio lot
Directed and co-written by first time director Richard Wilson, Man With The Gun holds few surprises for the genre, but it's dark in tone, violent and above all else, highly watchable
I really am shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie
This movie was not intended to be a "deep thought" movie, which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be
In fact, it would appear that if ANY movie doesn't produce a life altering insight, and a deep, twisted, mind boggling plot, they would rate it a 1 or 2
Don't trash a movie because you don't like the genre, people
<br /><br />This movie was an Action/Comedy flick, and that's all it was intended to be
And for an Action/Comedy, it was very well done
I was actually rather surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did, having never really been a Jamie Foxx fan, and having the over-used plot that it has
<br /><br />The plot was nothing spectacular, using the typical criminal gets out of prison, and is thrown into bad-guy plot while trying to clean up his act (See Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 Hours, etc
) but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist
Now the "bad guys" are actually the "good guys" and the REAL "bad guy" is an uber-geek
<br /><br />Jamie Foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous, while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character, and didn't try to overdo the humor side of the film
<br /><br />If you're looking for a deep underlying plot such as in "The Matrix" or a drama such as "Of Mice and Men" then this movie isn't for you
But if you enjoy the raw action, excellent fast-paced filming, and an occasional twist of humor tossed in, this movie won't disappoint you
I would normally have rated it about an 8 (on the same level as the Die Hard Trilogy), but instead gave it a 10 to try and bring the score up to what it SHOULD be
I can't say how closely the film follows the novel, never having read the book, but since this clocks in at some six and a half hours it's a good bet that most of the base are covered or, at least, we can say with some certainty that this isn't a Reader's Digest condensed version
<br /><br />The production values are high, well up to the standards of other BBC classic series like Inspector Morse and Sherlock Holmes
We can believe Dickens' London looked, sounded, and thought a lot like this
There are some occasional minor lapses -- some sportsman firing a pistol with a percussion cap in 1840 or 1820 or whenever this took place
<br /><br />The acting too is to be applauded
Suzanne Burden is the polite and honest heroine who quietly goes about doing good
She's cute too, in a mature way, her beauty in her compassionate nature not in any flirtatiousness
Denholm Elliott is her guardian (and more than that, as it turns out)
Burden and Elliott are two of the very few characters who are good in an unalloyed way
Another is a former sergeant forced to do evil by evil people
<br /><br />I don't think anyone else could have written this
It's got all the earmarks of Dickens -- poverty, tragic deaths, capitalism in the raw, the generous rich guy in his gated home, hidden parentage, shadowy motives, and the impotence or outright maliciousness of the justice system
Well, not the justice system as a whole but the chancery, which was evidently a court that decided matters having to do with the distribution of property
) It became so notoriously rigid and dilatory that it was thoroughly revamped in England in 1973
Twice, Elliott's character describes it as "a curse
" The most impressive scene involves a money-scrounging creditor hounding a retired soldier in the latter's gymnasium during a fencing lesson
The sergeant is more masculine in the traditional sense than any other male character I remember from Dickens
The apoplectic money lender and renter is screaming threats from his seat and the sergeant turns towards him and does one delicate exercise with the saber after another, each advancement bringing him closer to his tormentor, while the scarlet-faced old creditor shrinks back into his seat
<br /><br />A couple of things are missing
Often Dickens will stick in at least one or two amusing lines of dialog
Second, there are practically no Weberian "ideal types" -- no Mr
Third, the atmosphere, the whole ethos, is relentlessly dismal
One tribulation follows another, usually having to do with money or some shameful peccadillo out of the past
It's as if the author were venting his spleen on everything he hated in the world he knew
But one wonders what the chancery did to Dickens to deserve this kind of treatment
<br /><br />Maybe I should add that I've just watched the first episode of the 2005 series -- and it's better in two ways
There is more zip in the direction, so the pace is a little faster
Jarndyce is explained satisfactorily right up front, instead of lurking about in the shadows as that mysterious "curse," so the plot is easier to follow
Some things were "clicheish" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie "Enemy of the State" starring Will Smith
But for the most part very entertaining- good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the 2 wannabe thugs Julio and Ramundo (providing some comic relief)
This is a movie you can watch over again-say
some Wednesday night when nothing else is on
Ghost Story (the TV Movie--1972) was the pilot for the NBC series
The movie was well-written and well-acted and, I thought, when the 1972-73 tv season started, if the tv series is half as good as the movie, then NBC has a winner
(I wish this film was available on video!!) The series was a colossal disappointment--even with William Castle as exec
If, however,you have a chance to see the original TV movie, Ghost Story, check it out
We first watched this film as part of a festival of new Argentine films in 2000 at the Walter Reade
Although we liked it, we didn't think it was extraordinary
Watching it for a second time, we found a different meaning in this look at life in Buenos Aires
<br /><br />The film takes place in one of the darkest days of Argentina, as the DeLaRua administration was ending
The country was in turmoil after the economy, which had flourished earlier in the 1990s, under the artificially climate President Menen created
It was a time when bank accounts in dollars were frozen and people got themselves living a nightmare
<br /><br />The story begins just as Santamarina, a bank employee, is fired because the collapse of the economy
Instead of receiving sympathy from his wife, she locks him out of the apartment and he, for all practical purposes, becomes a homeless man
He takes to the streets trying to make ends meet
<br /><br />The other story introduces us to Ariel, a young Jew, interviewing for a job in a Spanish company
His father, Simon, owns a small restaurant in the Jewish quarter of "El Once" in the center of the city
Things go from bad to worse, when Ariel's mother dies suddenly
Only Estela, the young woman who is in love with Ariel, comes to help father and son
<br /><br />Santamarina, who is a clean man, has to resort to take showers wherever he can
He chooses a ladies' room in one of the subway stations
When the attendant, Elsa, finds him naked, she becomes furious, but she comes to her senses when she realizes the unhappy circumstances of this man who has seen better times
They become romantically involved, and Santamarina in one of his trips through the street garbage, finds an infant
Elsa, while surprised, wants to do the right thing
But Santamarina convinces her of the meaning of an innocent life in their lives will cement their love
<br /><br />Ariel, who has met the gorgeous Laura at work, begins a turbulent and heavy sexual affair with his beautiful co-worker, who unknown to him, is involved in a lesbian affair
Ariel who free lances by photographing weddings and other occasions, feels a passion for Laura, but he realizes what Estela has sacrificed in order to help his father and still loves him
<br /><br />Daniel Burman, whose "El Abrazo Partido" we thought was excellent, did wonders with this film
Things are put in its proper perspective after a second viewing recently and we must apologize for not having perceived it the first time around
If anything, this second time, the nuances of the screen play Mr
Burman and Emiliano Torres wrote, make more sense because they reflect the turmoil of what the country was living during those dark days
<br /><br />Daniel Hendler, who plays Ariel, has collaborated with Mr
He is not 'movie star pretty', yet, he is handsome
This actor projects a tremendous sincerity in his work
Enrique Pineyro is another magnificent surprise
In spite of all the bad things that have fallen on him, he keeps a rosy attitude toward everyone he meets
Stefania Sandrelli, the interesting Italian actress, makes a great contribution to the film with her Elsa
Hector Alterio, one of the best Argentine actors plays the small part of Simon
The gorgeous Chiara Coselli is seen as Laura and Melina Petrielli appears as the noble Estela
<br /><br />"Esperando al mesias" proves Daniel Burman is a voice to be reckoned with in the Argentine cinema
For fans of 1970s Hammer type horror films, this movie should be a treat
The only thing I didn't like about the film was the fact that Peter Cushing was wasted on the worst episode
In general, however, this is a solid, spooky little movie
If this is not Amicus' best film, it's certainly one of them
The best episode, rightfully saved for last, is the one featuring Jon Pertwee as a horror film actor--it is really excellent
As good as Pertwee was in this role, it's hard to believe he didn't do more of these types of movies
All in all, this is an entertaining movie, which scared the heck out of me as a child, and which still gives me the creeps to this day
I'd always wanted David Duchovney to go into the movie business, and finally he did, and he made me proud
This movie lived up to what I had hoped for
Duchovney played his character very well, managing to remain consistent with something new, instead of playing the Agent Molder we are used to
Therefore, I give him extra credit for his role, also because I could not see anyone else playing that particular character
David was great, but nothing compared to the psychotic Timothy Hutton
A brilliant performance that you don't get tired of throughout the movie, because he never fails to surprise you
He has weaknesses, and strengths, making the story all the more believable
I also very much enjoyed the narration, it added to the story a good deal, and had some very memorable quotes that i still use to all the time
I recomend this for anyone who likes drama, and doesn't mind blood
Have never understood why the MacDonald-Eddy swan song has always been panned so mercilessly--not just by their detractors but by virtually everyone
To me, "I Married an Angel" is more lively and imaginative than any of the duo's more celebrated outings
The sets and costumes are as lavish as any to be found in an MGM musical, the script is by the reliable Anita Loos ("San Francisco," "The Women," "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," etc
), the Rodgers and Hart tunes (albeit altered a bit by MacDonald-Eddy regulars Bob Wright and Chet Forrest) are given celestial treatment by Herbert Stothart (Oscar-winner for scoring "The Wizard of Oz"), and best of all, the "singing sweethearts" look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to be having fun with the bizarre proceedings
Try to show "Rose Marie" or "Sweethearts" to the uninitiated today and they may very well have a hard time sitting still, but this offbeat, fast-paced fantasy is bound to entertain
I make just one apology for this film: there are far, far, too many wide angle close-ups, and if they irritate you beyond endurance, fair enough
They drove ME barmy for the first ten minutes or so
But after that I made a kind of a truce with the terrible cinematography; and long before the end of the film, I had ceased to care
This is too rich a comedy to be destroyed so easily
It's hilarious, it's witty, the comic delivery of ALL of the cast is flawless, and however much Usher peers at his characters through a cold, fish-eye lens - HE may not care for them much - he manages to present them with warmth
`Mystery Men' is, in fact, not only funnier, not only more clever, but also deeper, than anyone seems to have given it credit for being
The jokes in the Austin Powers movies, for instance, as well as being less funny than the jokes here, are also much more toothless
The satire of `Mystery Men' bites when there's something worth biting and gnaws gently when there isn't
Which is why, contrary to what some (I must regard them as unobservant) critics have said, it never runs out of ideas
<br /><br />The `super' heroes are an attractive bunch
Sure, they're second-rate, but they're not merely second rate
The Blue Rajah, for instance, does nothing but throw cutlery at people, and he isn't THAT good at it
On the other hand, neither is he comically bad
He's better in his limited field than most people, and he DOES practise diligently
He's not a buffoon, which makes him a much funnier character than if he was
If Superman is Christ in a cape, the Mystery Men are all the minor demigods from the foothills of Mount Olympus, in capes
This unsung quiet gem tells the true story of a POW escape during WW II
The performances are incredible, especially Anthony Steele
The movie works on many different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual, and literal
The dialogue is ingenious and rings very true
In fact, an unusual all-around authenticity puts this one head-and-shoulders above most war epics
This movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10
for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no "good plot" or anything like that, thats ridiculous, saying that a Jackie Chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot! you watch Jackie Chan FOR THE FIGHT SCENES, for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that, if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other American films from that era and even later you will realize that Jackie Chan's movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while American movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan was doing at the time
Porn is watched for the porn, Jackie Chan is watched for the ACTION, i think you people are rating it bad because there's no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained
Sure the middle of the movie was boring, VERY BORING, but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that
This did change the way how American action movies were created, they have even stollen scenes from this movie
If you want a true man, a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of Jackie Chan's, hes pure in everyway
He literally makes American movies look like a walk in the park, and even in TODAYS movies
American movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more
Police Story and many other Jackie Chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do
<br /><br />The Crypt Keeper (John Kassir) tales a tale of holiday FEAR, giving us all Christmas Goose

<br /><br />Okay, so in the story, a greedy wife (Best screamer in the world, Mary Ellen Trainor) kills her husband (Marshall Bell, the coach who gets towel whipped to death in ANOES 2) for the money

<br /><br />If you look it up on YouTube, you can watch it for free, but most of you have already seen this (my third viewing)
But if you haven't seen it, I suggest you do
Reading a wide variety of "Scoop" reviews over the past few days, I walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from Woody
Granted, Woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two, but Woody the writer/director is in fine form - and found a credible way to integrate his 70-year old self into the story
Judging from the laughter and guffaws, the audience ate up Allen's one-liners and dialogue in a way that I haven't seen in several years
<br /><br />In a movie landscape dominated by software-approved story arcs, twentysomething tastes and assembly-line formula fare for kiddies, it's a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see Allen pursuing his highly personal and still-rewarding path
Not much to say about it except that it deals with a rarely touched topic in films of beastiality
I can see why this film was banned for so long, the topics dealt within the film are still a little taboo for most of the world will say the eroticism in the film is well deserved and fits in with the mood of the film
It's a good film that is well acted and serves a purpose
to shock the viewer and cross boundaries that we don't see to often in films
I came across this film on the net that I thought I might check out
I enjoyed the film as it is thought provoking and somewhat erotic at the same time
Something you don't rarely see in films today
this is the first of a two part back-story to the conflict between the machines and mankind in the Matrix world and it delivers spectacularly by combining observations on man's fear of the unknown and of being usurped with politics, extensive religious and historical imagery, subverting expected portrayals of parties involved and an at least partially believable and thus terrifying vision of our near future
it isn't perfect and some plot points and images are at once obvious and contrived but it has the desired effect and impact and tells a visceral and cautionary tale
<br /><br />this first part sets the scene - human societies have developed advanced and capable robots, mostly humanoid, to serve people doing menial, unskilled jobs, labour, construction etc
and thus the populace has become lazy and derogatory towards them
one robot, however, rebels and kills his owner, stating at his subsequent trial that he simply did not want to die
he is destroyed but when the robot masses' destruction is ordered to protect humanity many robots rise up in protest, with many human sympathisers alongside them
<br /><br />the imagery here is exploitative, recounting race riots and abuse, Tiananmen square, the holocaust and an overly provocative scene of a robot in a human girl's guise getting harried, hammered in the head and then shot dead as it pleads 'i'm real'
it lays on the ground, clothes and skin torn and breasts hanging out
it's an obvious and obscene image designed to present human fear towards uncontrolled elements and aggression towards groups based on the actions of individuals
<br /><br />anyway, this first portion is much like a compressed version of the film I Robot, but it soon develops into a recognisable Matrix back-story as the surviving robot contingent is exiled and congregates in the middle east, in the cradle of civilisation as the narrator informs us
there, the machines regroup and begin to produce new AI and to manufacture mass technology and trade it with human nations
we see a commercial for a car that uses the circular energy hover engines that the ships the rebels in the movies use and we see sentinel type robots flying around Zero One, the name of their city
their goods and trade make their economy soar affecting other economies detrimentally and human governments and authorities establish a blockade in response
the machines send ambassadors in the form of Adam and Eve resemblances to a UN congress to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the blockade, but they are forcibly removed and the scene is set for war in the second part
<br /><br />the animation is by Studio 4°C who work on quite a few of the Animatrix and it's evocative and visually stimulating, rendering different scenes like imagery montages, CCTV footage and particular scenes of import distinctive and overall presenting the story perfectly
the plot may not be an original concept and it may draw on simplistic sheep mentalities and plot models and resort to provocative material for impact but after the tantalising mystery offered by the first film and Morpheus' vague brief info-dumps this is a nice exposition of the cataclysmic events that left the world ravaged and in the hands of the machines that serves as a warning and as a vehicle for many observations and comments on the human condition, the development of AI and the importance of harmony and co-operation and the devastating consequences of conflict and prejudice, themes expanded on in the movies
This movie, which starts out with a interesting opening of two hot blondes getting it on in the back of a driver-less, moving vehicle, has quite the quirky little personality to boot
The cast of seven (although one girl doesn't hang around for the bodycount, which is unfortunate because the death toll is already so small as is) are all super-hot, as our story centers around teens partying way out in the desert (an odd but effective choice of setting), who are hunted down by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans who drives a black truck
It predates many of the vehicle-inspired slashers to date ("The Trip", "Joy Ride", "Jeepers Creepers") where the killer's vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist
The killer himself is quite creepy, and we find solace in the extremely likable heroine in Jennifer McAllister (look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all black, while our benevolent heroine sports all white attire, as scanty and stonewashed as it may be)
Director Bill Crain does some really great things with his camera, some neat tricks on screen, and the cast tries their absolute best
There's enough gore in the low bodycount to please the gore fans, and enough T&A from a couple of the girls to please T&A fans
Overall, this flick is highly underrated and widely sought out in the slasher movie world as it's proved quite rare to find on video
Creepier than anything David Lynch, and that shows what a great director Polanski is since this is not his usual type of work, and it is BRILLIANT
<br /><br />It all starts of with Trelkovski moves into a tenement block in Paris
He soon learns that the previous tenant, a young woman, committed suicide and he believes the rest of the people living there drove her to it
He also believes that they are trying to do the same to him
What results is a amazing and frightening look at paranoia
<br /><br />The whole production has classical horror written all over it: from the imagery to the music the viewer can feel poor Trelkovski's terror building up
<br /><br />Are they all out to kill him? Or maybe just drive him mad? Is there a difference? Find out for yourself
I admit creating great expectations before watching because some friends mentioned it (and they are not pervs!) as a must see
And it is a must see! Just don't expect to see something outbreaking
<br /><br />The Freudian psychoanalyzes are interesting in many parts of the film, but there's just too much perversion and it doesn't stick in the end
<br /><br />Some of the good things are the analyzes of Kieslowski's Blue, most of David Lynch's, some of Hitchcock's and perhaps a couple more I missed (I just remembered
Dogville), and I usually don't miss things unless they are too obvious or loose in the air
<br /><br />Other than being repetitive, which makes it too long, the documentary is enjoyable in the sense of noticing some perversions fed by our unconscious, hence the commercial success of most thrillers studied and used as basis for this theory
<br /><br />I really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narration and the effort of Mr
Zizek to revive Freud's theory, which has been numb for too long, specially in north America
Again, it's way over the top and I believe not to be a completely waste of time for I do believe most humans have a dark appreciation for death and blood
This is one of the greatest love story movies I have ever seen
Yes, I can agree that some parts may seem dated, but this does not distract from the film
One should try to observe, criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of the time
Clearly by the "Sex in the City" standards, Charlie Chaplin was horribly boring
However, when judged from the prospective of 1925 America, he was fantastic
Likewise Sayonara is a breakthrough film in its look into a mixed-race love affair, American "manifest destiny" arrogance and prejudice, and the complexity of different cultures
It is a natural next step to such films as Gentleman's Agreement
Its purpose, however, was not just social commentary, rather, it is entertaining and enjoyable, with innumerable lines that one just doesn't forget
<br /><br />However, even when taken only as a love story, it is terrific
Although, some attack Brando's accent, he is at his near best in nuance and characterization
Buttons and Umeki (who both won Oscars) and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the film
<br /><br />Taka, the real star, does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for Brando, while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty
Her speech when she first meets and speaks with Brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema
The dialog between Taka and Brando in her dressing room in Tokyo at the film's end is equally good
Of course, it doesn't have the mouth-sucking, spit-swapping and worse, that exemplifies love in today's movies, but that makes it all the better
It portrays true love and passion, and not just "heat
" If this movie doesn't touch you, then you are just too young, too cynical or dead
This video was my first exposure to Eddie Izzard
We had several friends over one night and for some reason or another had channel-surfed to HBO during the course of the evening
Someone by the name of "Eddie Izzard" was on
I tried not to laugh too loudly at the first few jokes
I didn't want to be held "responsible" for the rest of the group's enjoyment of something that was obviously killing me
After holding in my laughs for more than was healthful, I let go--as did the others of us(we were not stoned, by the way, nor talking of insurance and pensions
The story lines, the plot, the bizarre yet ingenious connections throughout the sketches are nothing short of brilliance
I have since been addicted to every Eddie-Izzard-piece-of-comedy I can get my hands on
He seems more like that hysterically funny friend hanging out at your house and rambling on about this or that
He gives you the impression that the joke is between you
and himself, the only true aficionados of humor, after all
If you are disappointed in this video, you have no sense of the penultimate in humor--or humour, as they say in the UK
Lion King 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive sequel
Don't expect the production values of a theatrical release, but do expect the highest quality of direct to video release
<br /><br />It is set up as Timon & Pumba begin watching the original Lion King in a darkened theater and abruptly switch tracks and begin narrating their own story
This is done with frequent comedic interruptions
For example, during one particular tense moment a home shopping commercial pops on and a chagrined Pumba realizes he has sat on the remote
These little moments pepper the movie, and whether you find them entertaining or not will greatly depend on your sense of humor
If you are particularly bothered by movies that deliberately remind the viewer is watching a movie, than this may not be your cup of tea
<br /><br />Animation is the best they've invested in the Disney DTV line, and is integrated almost seamlessly with the original material
The newer, independent material uses a lot of the artistic style of the original
The voice talents are all well performed, though I couldn't help thinking of Marge Simpson every time I heard Julie Kavner
<br /><br />Many of the jokes in the movie will be well recognized by viewers as recycled over the generations, but are presented more with the familiarity of comfortable quirks of old friends than annoyingly repetitive
<br /><br />The music has made me realize how much I enjoyed and miss a good musical integrated with a Disney feature
The toe-tapping opening feature of 'Dig A Tunnel' is well choreographed and hilarious
Timon and Pumba's take on the Lion King's opening sequence and their introduction to paradise are also amusing
The only problem was the reprise of the 'Dig A Tunnel' at the end of the movie, switching its lyrics and tune from defeatist to uplifting
<br /><br />Story line is pretty well done, and the integration of new plot elements is done almost perfectly, though the final bit during the hyena chased stretched the storyline credibility a little
The new story doesn't seem to handle saccharine or emotionally charged moments to well, and does better when it is resorting to full comedy
If you like all the bonus features that come with a typical 2-disc set, then go for it
For the penny pincher who still is willing to invest on a good flick, wait until it drops four or more dollars and go rent it right away
One of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history
ZODIAC KILLER offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers
The filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer, and anyone who remembers Zodiac will be intrigued
Others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal
Unlike many serial killers, Zodiac was not insane at all but very methodical and a self-promoter
The director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off
The film is constructed as a murder mystery, or a "cold case"-style thriller
It is an intelligent investigative/procedural-style horror film that will put-off gore-hounds in search of cheap thrills
<br /><br />Some people dislike any movie that is shot on video
This attitude is very old-style and provincial
It is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value
ZODIAC KILLER is a low-budget film, no doubt, but discerning viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully-crafted gem
Absolutely, it does not belong to the Hollywood Cinema genre where every line must be pronounced in a perfect manner and where every move is precise
The actors playing the roles of the lovers do a GREAT job representing the characters' feelings and thoughts - their everyday life adventures
Overall, the movie climaxes the viewer to a depressed state
This is where the realism of the whole story is apparent
Not everything happens the way we think it should happen
I can say though that the movie does not end on a bad note
We watch, we learn, we experience ourselves
Psychotic transsexual Bobbi murders the patient (Angie Dickinson) of a prominent doctor (Michael Caine) and then pursues the high-priced prostitute (Nancy Allen) who caught a glimpse of Bobbi in the elevator
Liz (Allen) comes under suspicion of the crime and teams up with the patient's son (Keith Gordon) to catch the killer
<br /><br />It can be summed up in a couple of words: it's very sexy (Dickinson and Allen look great), it's very bloody - with the kind of gore usually reserved for splatter movies, and boy is it well crafted
Writer / director De Palma's script is OK but it really takes a backseat to the man's film-making abilities
It is highly successful on a visceral level and I actually get involved / interested with these characters
I can notice the standard De Palma homages to / ripoffs of Hitchcock - at least from one of the Master's pictures
<br /><br />And to top it all off, it has a professional and believable cast
<br /><br />This was De Palma's third movie with ex-wife Nancy Allen (after "Carrie" and "Home Movies"
)<br /><br />By the way, dancer-turned-actress Rachel Ticotin was one of the production assistants
<br /><br />I wouldn't think a thriller could be classy and bloody at the same time but this picture pulls it off
<br /><br />One of the best things about it is a typically striking Pino Donaggio music score
because a lot of good characters disappeared later on
like most shows are kinda slow at first then get better in later seasons, but this is the absolute reverse
jenny from the 1st season and Valarie from the 2nd season were Sabrina's friends, i really didn't care for the others, jenny and Valarie were her coolest friends
i think for some reason, the producers wanted us to not like her college friends for some reason, they were so cruel to Sabrina
but my favorite episode from season 1 is cat showdown and my favorite episode from season 2 is witch trash, that is the funniest episode
i also thought it was funny how Libby was popular but she was always jealous of Sabrina, and never seemed to have a real boyfriend but was always wanting to be with Harvey
i just wished they could have made more better ones
i also liked how the first 2 seasons, during the opening credits Sabrina would say a few words while wearing a costume, like in the pilot episode where she's in the witch costume, i liked how she said "this is so not me" and later on she kept trying to change herself to something else is what i think, but this is a really cool show
it is kinda like the andy griffith show in a way because it good at first but once it turned color and barney fife left, it was longer good
but i still like to watch it, but the only reason i watch later seasons is because of sabrina
what i meant about the opening sequence is: the opening titles of seasons 1-3 shows Sabrina in front of a mirror posing with several different costumes and outfits as the cast members' names quickly flash on the bottom of the screen
At the end, Sabrina would say some sort of pun that related to the outfit she is wearing, then disappear
the opening sequence of season four includes the characters in bubbles
the opening credits of seasons 5-7 features Sabrina at various locations around Bosto
I couldn't find anyone to watch DiG! with me because no one I knew was a fan of either of the bands
Naturally everyone assumed you can only enjoy this film if you like the music of either The Dandy Warhols or the Brian Jonestown Massacre, but this is so far from the truth
The only requirement is that you have an interest in music and/or pop culture in general
The way in which the careers of the two groups are paralleled is a perfect representation of the paths a band can take, and watching the public eat up and spit out the Dandy Warhols is fascinating
I agree with other reviews that mention it would be nice to get a final word from Anton himself, since he's clearly depicted as his own worst enemy and the bulwark to the band's ability to just remain
<br /><br />Most interesting to me is the Dandys' respect for the BJM (despite their lack or reciprocation) and for Anton (despite his erratic behavior)
The Dandy Warhols respect the art the group produces even if the group hates everything the Dandy Warhols now stand for (although that's disputable)
The best line is when the drummer for the Dandy's says "I won't have them anywhere new me again" and the guitarist unconsciously blurts out "I'll still buy their records though
" To me, this just shows how powerful good music can be
<br /><br />Definitely see this movie, even if you know nothing of either band
It's more about the themes of rock music and how they develop that makes this film so interesting
It's rare to follow a group so closely for so long
First, let's get the "hoopla" out of the way
Hedy Lamarr was regarded as one of the most beautiful of women and the movies were a perfect medium for the many to see her beauty on screen
Here we have Hedy as a young fresh-faced 20 year old speaking in her native Austrian
I recently bought a 1990 uncensored version of this 1932/3 classic
Yes we see a brief close up of Hedy bare from the waist up but although she filmed the swimming & runaway horse scenes naked, the director Gustav Machaty uses the cover of branches, reflections in puddles, medium and long shots to show her thus in this famous scene; so don't go imagining there are any lascivious close ups or clinches
Her boyfriend , Pierre Nay keeps his clothes on at all times
Yes, fairly daring for its day but how innocous it looks now through 2003 eyes
<br /><br />As other learned reviews have stated this film should be looked at for the imagary, expressionism, and allegorical statements it makes with pictures of drops of water forming a ripple on the surface of a pale of water, farm machinery, landscapes etc
Sweet sounding strings run for most of "Extase's" length and the film has a "feel" of a transition between silent and sound in its direction and concept
The script is highly minimalist and economical the story being mainly imparted through the medium of facial and bodily gestures with just a few words of German spoken by the actors with English subtitles beneath
Even these few words seem almost superflous in the general lyrical vein which runs through the film
<br /><br />Put very simply this is the story of a young girl who marries a much older man (why we are never told and what did Eva see in him anyway?Money?), who is then trapped in an unconsumated and loveless marriage
She then returns to her father having left her husband and her father has to lie to his son in law
After a ride on her horse Eva decides to take a swim in the buff and loads up her clothes onto her horse's saddle
However her horse gets romantic notions itself and gallops off to greet its stablemate
Hedy rushes out of the lake naked and tries to recover her mount but an engineer at work sees and retrieves the horse then looks around for its owner
Her husband seeing that his rival must win Eva, later decides to shoot himself but I thought this was rather illogical and its main weakness bearing in mind his previous loveless relationship with Eva
<br /><br />Despite being a 1990 reissue title on VHS, the sound being 70 years old, is a bit soft and with background crackles, in line with films of its age
After a period of mourning our handsome boyfriend obviously is so in love with Eva he imagines her as a mother with an infant so we have to assume they live happily ever after
Just let the imagary wash over you and disabuse your mind of the style of films even of late 1930's vintage
This is a lyrical piece that can be enyoyed for its own sake and not just for its eye catching title
Story says that on that on December 28, 1895, a small group of thirty-three people was gathered at Paris's Salon Indien Du Grand Café to witness the Cinématographe, a supposedly new invention that resulted from the work done by a couple of photographers named August and Louis Lumière
The small audience reunited that day (some by invitation, most due to curiosity) didn't really know what to expect from the show, and when a stationary photograph appeared projected on a screen, most thought that the Cinématographe was just another fancy devise to present slide-show projections
What those thirty-three people experienced in awe that cold day of December was the very first public screening of a moving picture being projected on a screen; history was being written and cinema as we know it was born that day
<br /><br />Of the 10 short movies that were shown during that historic day, "La Sortie Des Usines Lumière" (literally "Exiting the Lumière Factory") was the very first to be screened
The film shows the many workers of the Lumière factory as they walk through the gates of the factory, leaving the building at the end of a hard day of work
While a very basic "actuality film" (movie depicting a real event), the movie took everyone in the audience by surprise, as their concept of moving pictures was limited to Edison's "Peep Show" machines (the Kinetoscope), the brothers' invention was like nothing they had seen before and so the audience stood in awe, as the people and the horses moved across the screen
The idea wasn't entirely new (Le Prince shot the first movie as early as 1888), but the way of showing the movie was simply revolutionary
<br /><br />"La Sortie Des Usines Lumière" would become the first in the long series of "actuality films" that the Lumière would produce over the years
This primitive form of documentary was the brothers' favorite kind of film because they were more interested in the technological aspects of their invention than in the uses the Cinématographe could have
Despite the initial lack of enthusiasm, after the first showing the Cinématographe became a great success and "La Sortie Des Usines Lumière" quickly became an iconic image of that first screening
It definitely wasn't the first movie the brothers shot that year, and it probably wasn't the best of the 10 movies shown that day (personally I think that "L' Arroseur Arrosé" was the best of the 10); however, it is really meaningful that the very first movie was the opening of a pair of gates, as literally, this movie opened the gates to cinema as we know it
Damn, I've seen this movie for at least 4 times now and I still don't get bored watching it
<br /><br />The visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind-blowing to me
<br /><br />The CGIs are quite bad IMHO, but the whole visuals with the black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interiors were just
Just a genius perfect combination for such a movie
The whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable, the plot is so good
<br /><br />However although, the movie had little flaws, like e
sometimes I thought the movie was a bit too "slow", but I don't mean the scenic parts by that, I totally loved those
<br /><br />Also I got distracted very often by the totally complex story, like when he is in the underground bunker-like thing of digicorps, where all their data is saved, and has this conversation with the guy down there
but that may also just be me :D And the end could have been displayed somehow more emphasized, they should have made the getting-back-true-memory-part a bit longer and "louder" but then again without all these flaws the movie would have been so good i would have never stopped watching it again and again
In the '70s, Charlton Heston starred in sci-fi flicks of varying quality
"Soylent Green" is one of the better ones
He plays Robert Thorn, a detective in 2022 New York
In this future, most food is so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green
But when Thorn finds out the unsavory truth about this product, he finds himself on the run
<br /><br />I guess that it's only natural that this movie should seem dated to us nowadays
But even so, it still brings up interesting questions about what will become of our agriculture
Also starring Leigh Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors, Brock Peters, Joseph Cotten and Edward G
Eddie Izzard is a one-in-a-million comic genius
He goes from squirrels to WWII to Stonehenge to religion to Englebert Humperdink and it's absolutely hilarious and it all makes sense! Get a copy of this now, you won't regret it! I give this an 11 out of 10
I was absolutely blown away by John Cassavetes's Opening Night
It's the first movie of his that I've seen that seems to be on a bigger scale, thus it feels more mainstream, but it still doesn't feel as if he grounded himself any more than he has in his previous films
There is also something undoubtedly cathartic about watching this movie
<br /><br />It's about what in fact Cassavetes has made a staple of his career, an ideal that he has expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and is here expressing it in front
Rowlands's character, middle-aged stage actress Myrtle Gordon, cannot bring herself to play her role in the upcoming production as written so she uncalculatedly follows impulse after impulse, resulting in what appears to be chaos on stage, until she finds the right one
<br /><br />This is a movie that does not fail to capture the innate steering that one goes through during an emotional cleansing
No one understands why Myrtle does many of the things she does, and it is seen and even portrayed as something destructive, yet it just might be the best thing for her
It may be a cleansing rather than a breakdown
A withdrawal, a cocoon, a rebellion, it all culminates into a meltdown
Cassavetes gives her character a brutally real touch, which is that early on, she is ardently arguing that she has nothing in common with her character, yet she is in quiet but emotionally corroding fear that the opposite is true
<br /><br />The last scene, the climactic performance that Myrtle shares with a character painfully estranged from her who is acting with her, is one of the most interesting, hilarious, hard-hitting, enlightening, and enjoyable moments I've ever seen in a movie
If your idea of a thriller is car chases, explosions, and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire, then "House of Games" is definitely not the movie for you
If you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense, then, by all means, see it
<br /><br />"House of Games" tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer, Dr
Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic Mike (Joe Mantegna)
To say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense
Frankly, I find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming
Just like a clever con artist, this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance
<br /><br />The story is taut and well-crafted, the dialogue smart and laconic, the acting uniformly good (Mantegna is superbly charismatic)
Ford is not a very sympathetic character, and wondered why Mamet would make Lindsay Crouse look so physically unattractive
Ford is supposed to be cold and aloof; moreover, her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot (at one point, I believe that an injury to her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her motivation
<br /><br />"House of Games" is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity
It will hold your attention every second while you are watching, and stay with you for a long time afterwards
A typical romp through Cheech and Chong's reality which includes drugs, singing, more drugs, cars and driving, even more drugs, Pee Wee, aliens, gasoline, laundry, stand up comedy, surprisingly more drugs and SPACE COKE !!
It is not as coherent or plausible as Up in Smoke but it still is incredibly funny, without becoming as strange as Nice Dreams
There are some classic scenes, which include the opening scene where they get some gas for their car and the drive to work
Also funny is Cheech's song (Mexican-Americans) and Chong's follow up song
Another notable scene is the welfare office scene with Jones (human noise machine), from the Police Academy series, and the old laughing man
All in all, this is a great follow up to Up in Smoke and is quite watchable when sober or not
<br /><br />This is a pretty fast and enjoyable crime thriller based on Ira Levin's play about two gay playwrights (Caine and Reeve) that plot the murder of one's rich wife (Cannon) to get the property and the insurance
The plot succeeds but Christopher Reeve as the younger and less established of the two writers decides to make a play out of the actual murder -- with only slight changes in the details
Reeve allows that Easthampton, Long Island, can become Southampton, Long Island, in the script, for instance
The rest of the play's plot is a dead giveaway and to tell the truth Reeve doesn't mind a little gossip or even an inquiry into Cannon's apparently accidental death
It will boost the revenues and his own Warhol quotient
<br /><br />Michael Caine is Sidney Bruhl, the megabucks-making playwright whose last four productions bombed and who would like nothing more than to quietly get back to working on a new play, perhaps with Reeve's input, that would redeem his reputation
He cannot permit Reeve's scandalous play-a-clef to be produced
So -- what else? -- he tries to murder him
In the end they wind up killing one another, the manuscript is appropriated by their neighbor, the psychic Helga Tensdoorp, and she makes a million bucks selling it to Broadway
<br /><br />It's a lot of fun for a number of reasons
That multi-roomed, multi-storied house with the big windmill atop, situated on nine of what must be the most valuable acres on earth (Easthampton!) would be a splendid set of digs anywhere
You wouldn't be able to afford a pup tent in Easthamptom
The house is not overly large or baroque in its decor
It's just magnificently modest, although it's a little tidy for my tastes, the kind of house that's so clean you're afraid to step on the thick carpet for fear of leaving the imprint of a foot
<br /><br />Next, the acting could hardly be improved upon
Dyan Cannon gives a pitch-perfect performance as the anxious wife whose slacks are so tight they look as if they'd been sprayed on, which is okay given her assets
Even Reeve, whose talent was limited, seems to find a comfortable niche in his role of affable but psychopathic murderer
Irene Worth, as the psychic neighbor Helga, was in some way hard to define, a mistake
Granted she -- or someone like her -- was necessary to the plot, but, my God, what an offensive snoop her character is, going around and claiming, "I feel pain in zis woom!" I suppose in order to make her a little more interesting, she's got up in sweats and a goofy looking cap with bicycle reflectors on it
Still, she's a nuisance from beginning to end
<br /><br />You have to love Ira Levin's bitchy dialog
The distraught Caine begs Reeve to tell him why he wrote the tell-all play
"Because it's THERE, Sidney!" says Reeve, and Caine shouts, "That's MOUNTAINS, not PLAYS! Plays aren't there until some ***hole WRITES them!" Great too is Caine's call to the police after his wife drops dead of fright, as planned
He works himself up into a torrent of sobs, barely able to speak, as he reports the incident and implores that an ambulance be sent immediately
When he hangs up, his face assumes its usual placid expression, he blows his nose into his handkerchief, and walks away, all business again
<br /><br />The climax, though suitably ironic, is confusing and noisy and full of artifice, lacking in the wicked charm that Levin and Lumet brought to the earlier scenes
The score is mostly made up of light-hearted riffs on the harpsichord, neatly fitting into the film
This movie is one of my all time favorites
Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr
Drama, action, adventure and comedy all rolled up into one
The final battle scene still to this day gives me chills and the ending always leaves me in tears
If you haven't seen it, I'd strongly recommend it
Generally, I am not a huge fan of stop-motion films and at first RUKA didn't capture my attention
However, knowing that this film was made in the repressive Czechoslovakia during the Soviet-domination era, the more I watched the film, the more I realized just how subversive this innocent looking little film was
This subtext really made the film come to life and gives it real staying power as both a work of art and a political statement
<br /><br />The sad little film is done without any dialog, but it's pretty clear what is happening
A cute little wooden man is making a clay pot and having a lovely time when suddenly a meddling animated hand appears and destroys the pot--making it into a sculpture of a hand instead
Well, the wooden man tries again and again to chase away the hand and do his own thing
However, over time the hand becomes more and more insistent and eventually cages the man
And, by the end, the man is dead thanks to the meddling hand and the hand, in a sign of real hypocrisy, gives the man a hero's funeral! <br /><br />As I said, this film is an obvious attempt by the brave Jirí Trnka to criticize his domineering government
Not surprisingly, though Czechs loved the film and gave it critical praise, the state (i
Sadly, Trnka did not live to see his nation liberated a little more than two decades later during the co-called "Velvet Revolution"
Homicide: The Movie proved to be a good wrap-up to a well-written, well-directed, and well-acted series
Loose ends were tied up that weren't properly addressed at the end of the final season
The entire series, and especially the movie, provided a life-like look at life (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate
My attraction to the series began long before I moved to Baltimore, but once I experienced life here for myself, I realized how realistic it was
And the movie certainly retained that spirit
I will certainly miss new original episodes of the series, but am very grateful to NBC and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of Charm City
Generally, it's difficult to rate these cut-&-paste films
Some of the segments can be quite good while others bring down the rating of the overall product
In this one, for instance, the all-girl scene in the Doctor's office was quite exciting
one of the best in this viewer's (limited) viewing history
And the story that binds the whole together was an interesting concept
The swap scene that closes out the offering ain't bad either
Technically, the production values are fairly high
Very good point there : "only an elite few (the upper classes) would both have access to the internet AND be able to communicate on an exclusively English speaking site such as the IMDb" Some might think Internet Is not reality but this point of view really put media society and democracy at stake: You are probably right
Even If there Is Internet cafe's in Venezuela most Chavez supporters will not afford to even rent a computer for half an hour to comment on IMDb
<br /><br />Screw you faschist upper class rich right wing capitalist liberal intellectual surpressors
Probably this is your first time using Internet ;)
Shakespeare's "The Tempest" is a model for this exceptional science fiction film
Prospero and his daughter, Miranda, are stranded on a Mediterranean island
" Morbius and Altaira are marooned on the 4th planet circling the star Altair
Caliban's evil hardly approaches that of Monsters of the Id
We wonder if mankind must suffer the fate of the Krell in some future time
Kelly starred with James Garner in the comedy/western TV series, "Maverick
Walking home after the film, I was humming the familiar waltz music that Natalia and Alexandre were dancing to
I've heard that before - where? Ah, from Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" (track 2), 'got it just as I arrived at the door
2" composed by Dimitri Shostakovich, performed here by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra
Yes, I went and picked up the soundtrack from Tower's
What a treat! The film score by Alexandre Desplat was fulfilling - there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz
It's not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score
Reminds me of favorite scores by Maurice Jarre, Ennio Morricone (beginning notes of track 6 have traces of "Nuovo cinema Paradiso"), Georges Delerue, and John Barry
There are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings, celeste, piano, and harp
<br /><br />Emily Watson and John Turturro delivered a credibly consuming paired performance
The love story, their intimate connection, is very much between Alexandre and Natalia - his childlike yet tormenting inner world, and her generous and bold understanding of him - a relationship alone to them both
Director Marleen Gorris of "Antonia's Line" (1996 Academy Award's Best Foreign Language Film from the Netherlands) gave us a quietly sensitive film - not without its unsettling human conflicts, intrigues, obsessions, family strives, lovingness and respect
The front-end subject is the mind-game and mathematical logic of chess
Beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in the late 1920's
Cinematography captures the serene beauty of Lake Como in northern Italy near the Swiss border
<br /><br />I highly recommend the soundtrack if you don't feel like going to the movies
Alexandre Desplat's lyrical film score of "The Luzhin Defence" is complete
I would say for it's time, this movie was awesome
and yes if you have no desire to become a Christian, then why bother watching it
I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be very moving
I see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the Left Behind series
they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people
I think in order to actually judge this movie, you should see it,,,there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I am not mistaken
don't use our comments to judge, see the movie for yourself!! God will bless you if that is why you are watching them
Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger switch the goodie-baddie roles they held in "All the brothers were valiant"
Taylor seems a bit uncomfortable in his bad-guy role but Granger plays his part perfectly
However the real hero in the story are the bison and the northwest
The film is perfectly made, with the atmosphere of the times wonderfully given
The direction is taut and although the film is no light-hearted entertainment it is, to my way of thinking a major film, unjustly ignored by the cognoscenti
I saw True Crime when it was first released back in the mid-nineties and I have watched it many times since
It is a great mystery about Mary (played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school senior in a California town who's classmate's younger sister was tortured and killed by an unknown murderer
Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police cadet who sees how bright she is and they decide to work together to try to find the killer
True Crime feels very "true" or real to me
I read a newsgroup review where someone wrote that total suspension of disbelief is present here and it is so true
Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job, as do the other actors
The locations are right on and the writer/director, Pat Verducci, really captures some of the realities of teenage life and of Mary's loneliness (see the scene where Mary awakens from the dream sequence after having viewed the photos she took of Tony)
<br /><br />I have not seen any other movie quite like True Crime
I really enjoyed this movie and it was a little difficult do that when your brother is making stupid comments in it ever 30 seconds
But this movie I enjoyed, mostly because I'm used to the usual HK action films
Most of the films like this are don't watch it for the story line, watch it for the mindless action
You get to see Jet Li Jump, spin, kick, punch, shoot, make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets
It's true that this movie was released to a broader audience after Li was in Lethal Weapon 4
That is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped
Most people were probably expecting to see a movie that was as polished as a North American film
But you need to remember most HK film budgets aren't nearly as high as a North American film, and the style in a HK action film is usually very different usually requiring in wire work in a lot of them
If you want to see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbing
I sat down to watch this film with much trepidation and little hope
I didn't think it would be possible for this film to live up to its subject matter
First, I must say that Jared Harris did an extraordinary job as John Lennon
At times it seemed that Harris was channeling Lennon
The resemblance was often uncanny, and he clearly studied Lennon's mannerisms and vocal inflections
Aiden Quinn was quite good as McCartney, also bearing a striking resemblance to Macca, although he did occasionally trip over his Scouse accent
<br /><br />This work of fiction was well-written and well-directed
It was pure fantasy, of course, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur peeking through a keyhole at this reunion
The rooftop scene was especially moving, as McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard as a child--that he was worthy and important, and it could never be his fault that he was abandoned by his parents
I also enjoyed the scene in the park where the pair of them danced with absolute abandon to the reggae band!<br /><br />My one complaint would be this: I am not so sure that John was as caustic as he was portrayed in the film at this stage in his life
He had settled in to his domestic situation quite nicely, and he was actually known to be quite friendly when approached by fans
Only a few years later, he was very friendly when he was first approached by his assassin for an autograph on the day he was murdered
<br /><br />Mostly this film served to stir up those feelings again about what might have been had John lived a bit longer
I am quite sure the Beatles would have come back together at some stage
And I am quite certain that Lennon and McCartney would still be friends today
"9/11," hosted by Robert DeNiro, presents footage from outside and inside the Twin Towers in New York, on September 11, 2001
<br /><br />Never too grisly and gory, yet powerful and moving
Anyone not moved by this television show is immune to anything
"Bruce Almighty" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers
Nevertheless, I found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more
Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry at God and is given divine powers by him to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job
Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized here as God, and though it isn't his usual type of film or one of his best roles, he does excellent with what he is given to work with
Although crude at times, the film does have quite a few laughs, from Bruce parting his soup in half like the Red Sea and the customers' reactions to him, as well as Freeman's seemingly laid-back and wisecracking image of God
It is overly exaggerated at times, and there is some crude humor, but overall it manages to be somewhat funny
There is a decent supporting cast, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carrell, which always helps
The end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear-jerking, and the message is clear, that we should do what God has called us to do and "be the miracle
" The film is far from perfect, but still enjoyable, and far better than I and many people probably would have expected, especially if we see the deeper message of the film
It is really best Serbian movie made ever
I wood like to recommend this movie to everyone
I've watched this movie twice, and I plan to see it again
It is the movie that puts you in the director's place, regarding his romantic relations and the political situation in Israel
It also makes me cry because of remembering the wonderful time it was, and the horrible murder described there
This timeless proverb reverberates in this movie and in my heart
So many years have I waited to see this eternal story! I was not ready, perhaps
It is possible that my sensibilities would not have appreciated its power
So I now gratefully welcome it into my soul with gladness
<br /><br />My respect and admiration for PAUL MUNI has been long
But now I have finally discovered the priceless gifts of LUISE RAINER's splendid talents
Oh, how many faces can speak as did hers? Some have said that it was wrought from her silent years, and this well might have been but her speech, is eloquent enough when it is given a chance
<br /><br />This movie is in an epic in the most classical proportions
Naysayers may walk away if they wish, but they would be shunning a storytelling which stays with one a lifetime
<br /><br />THE GOOD EARTH enriches one in ways that one does not expect
But all will not come from it with the joy that I did
But I can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years
<br /><br />Do not prod me with mere technicalities regarding the race of the principal players
These are expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with utter perfection
But I dare a million score of newer films to tell PEARL BUCK's story with such poignancy, power, conviction and grace
<br /><br />If any modern artist would dare to re-film this masterpiece, I warn them that they will never come close to the aromatic fragrance which still emanates from the core of this telling
Time will not diminish this effort nor will progress improve upon its greatness
This is one of the best reunion specials ever, with Adam West and Burt Ward parodying themselves and having fun while doing it
It's amazing the amount of effort that went into the detail, particularly recapturing the feel of the 1960's era, the Batcave set, Wayne Manor, the costumes, and the actors selected to play the younger versions of West, Ward, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero, and Frank Gorshin! This 90 minutes is well worth your time, and is a delight to all fans of the classic 1960's "Batman" television series
I note that clips from "Batman" were from the movie, and not the series itself, probably because of legal restrictions
Let's hope the three seasons of the show are forthcoming on DVD
This is a must see for any fan of 70's rock
(I hope me and my friends aren't like that in twenty years!)<br /><br />Bill Nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spirit,<br /><br />Stephen Rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together, but not succeeding well
<br /><br />If you love music, and were ever in a band, this movie is definitely for you
Even my family found it funny, and that's saying something
To its advantage it is directed by Wes Craven
On the downside the TV film budget shows what could have been so much more with a larger budget
It moves along as Susan Lucci draws Robert Urichfamily into her clutches and trying to persuade him into the secret of her health club
His latest invention, a spacesuit which can analyse people or things becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighbourhood
Anyone seeing this should pay attention to Susan Lucci
Her looks and performance had an unexpected repercussions a few years later
The actor, scientist and parapsychologist Stephen Armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film
Lucci became subject of a portrait by him followed as the basis for works of a sitter called Catherine
Lucci and Barbara Steele's portrait in 'Black Sunday' were used as references for the Catherine portraits which were immediately withdrawn by Armourae
Probably due to a personal nature between the artist and Catherine
So by seeing both films we can get an insight into another story and the appearance of unknown woman that would make an interesting film
After the unexpected accident that killed an inexperienced climber (Michelle Joyner)
The Rocky Mountain Rescue receive a distress call set by a brilliant terrorist mastermind Eric Quaien (John Lithgow)
Quaien has lost three large cases that has millions of dollars inside
Two experienced climbers Walker (Sylvester Stallone) and Tucker (Micheal Rooker) and a helicopter pilot (Janine Turner) are to the rescue but they are set by a trap by Quaien and his men
Now the two climbers and pilot are forced to play a deadly game of hide and seek
While Quaien is trying to find the millions of dollars and he kidnapped Tucker to find the money
Once Tucker finds the money, Tucker will be dead
Against explosive firepower, bitter cold and dizzying heights
<br /><br />Directed by Renny Harlin (Driven, Mindhunters, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4:The Dream Master) made an entertaining non-stop action picture
This film is a spectacular, exciting, visually exciting action picture with plenty of dark humour as well
Lithgow is a terrific entertaining villain
Stallone certainly made an short comeback of this sharp thriller
This is probably Harlin's best work as a filmmaker
<br /><br />DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2
35:1) transfer and an terrific-Dolby Digital 5
DVD has an running commentary track by the director with comments by Stallone
DVD also has technical crew commentary as well
DVD has behind the scenes featurette, two deleted scenes with introduction by the director and more
Screenplay by Micheal France (Fantastic Four) and actor:Stallone (The Rocky Series)
Excellent Cinematography by Alex Thomson, B
Oscar Nominated for Best Sound, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects
Steve Carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices, family and pressure
By judging on the plot and cover art of the movie I was expecting a flat-out comedy, lots of laughs and unrealistic elements, but I guess I was wrong
Sure the movie had some comedy, but it felt much more of a light Drama to me and Steve Carell once again gave a great performance
The movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element I found
But, the ending felt a little bit rushed and predictable
Through-out, the cinematography was great, the acting was great and the message it delivered was obvious but yet still very important
Though, it came down to old, flat and predictable ending
I'd reckon if different choices were made at the end of the movie (perhaps for the bad, even) this movie would get better publicity
After a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted, urban, turn of the century Australian street, we meet Julie (Rebecca Gibney) and Peter (John Adam) as they go out house hunting
They manage to get a loan for a fixer-upper on a posh Sydney street, but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home
<br /><br />13 Gantry Row combines a memorable if somewhat clichéd story with good to average direction by Catherine Millar into a slightly above average shocker
<br /><br />The biggest flaws seem partially due to budget, but not wholly excusable to that hurdle
A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film
The opening "thriller scene" features some wonky editing
Freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there's not much action
Suspense should be created from staging, not fancy "fix it in the mix" techniques
There is great atmosphere in the scene from the location, the lighting, the fog and such, but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim, cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street, showing their increasing proximity
The tracking and the cuts need to be slow
The attack needed to be longer, clearer and better blocked
As it stands, the scene has a strong "made for television" feel, and a low budget one at that
<br /><br />After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves
The story has a lot of similarities to The Amityville Horror (1979), though the budget forces a much subtler approach
Millar and scriptwriter Tony Morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios, often dramatic in nature instead of special effects-oriented, such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron, which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall
<br /><br />For some horror fans, the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama
At least the first half hour of the film is primarily about Julie and Peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in
But Morphett writes fine, intelligent dialogue
The material is done well enough that it's often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later--especially if you've gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house
<br /><br />Once they get settled and things begin to get weirder, even though the special effects often leave much to be desired, the ideas are good
There isn't an abundance of death and destruction in the film--there's more of an abundance of home repair nightmares
<br /><br />The point is human relationships
There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting
The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it
That it's in a posh neighborhood, and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies, shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe, such as money or health problems
Peter's character evolves from a striving corporate employee with "normal" work-based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive, scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful
At the same time, we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be
Julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown, but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship
<br /><br />Although 13 Gantry Row never quite transcends its made-for-television clunkiness, as a TV movie, this is a pretty good one, with admirable ambitions
Anyone fond of haunted house films, psycho films or horror/thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy
It certainly isn't worth spending $30 for a DVD (that was the price my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it (factoring in shipping and handling)), but it's worth a rental, and it's definitely worth watching for free
"Secret Sunshine" reminded me of "The Rapture" (1991), with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better film
It portrays super-religious Korean Christians in a provincial Korean city, and the main character's experiences interacting with them in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy
Shin-ae is a widowed single mother who moves to the city of Milyang ('Secret Sunshine' in Chinese) from Seoul with her young son
She has chosen Milyang because her late husband (killed in an auto accident) was born there, and she feels she needs to make a new start in life in a new place
She does not react well to the overtures of the local Christian zealots, one of whose members tries to convince her to come to their church and prayer meetings
Shin-ae is essentially irreligious and brushes these people off as politely as she can
In fact, she brushes just about everyone in Milyang off to begin with, but some of them are persistent in trying to invade her world, and the consequences are often hilarious
To say more would be to give the film away, but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role (Jeon Do-yeon) is stupendous
Having read that she won the Best Actress award at Cannes in 2007, I expected her to a decent job
Jeon is captivating and it is impossible to take your eyes off her when she is on screen
The movie is a sort of harrowing Evelyn Waugh-esquire piece of work, showing how Fate can feel insane as much as strangely inevitable
Beyond the excellent direction,production,acting & the predictable drama lies an essential message in the script:<br /><br />"Listening leads all the way" In order for the voice to flourish,listen
To discover the needs of any situation or others,listen
It appears that the script writers are conveying a "life's secret"
Listening leads to an awareness of one's Self
It awakens the other senses, especially vision & expands the horizon
The artistry of this movie "As it is in Heaven" magnificently displayed the unfolding of life,not only its joy & sadness,but ultimately the hope of life
All this by the leading character's first instruction to the choir;<br /><br />"Just Listen,it leads all the way
Brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous the relatives of Chilean President Salvador Allende killed
In the environment of a large estate that arises from the ruins, becoming a force to abuse and exploitation of outrage, a luxury estate for the benefit of the upstart Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family, the brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates, in micro, which at the time would be the process leading to the greatest infamy of his story to the hardened Chilean nation, and whose main character would Augusto Pinochet (Stephen similarities with it are inevitable: recall, as an example, that image of the senator with dark glasses that makes him the wink to the general to begin making the palace)
<br /><br />Bille August attends an exceptional cast in the Jeremy protruding Irons, whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty, the hard lesson that life always brings us to almost force us to change
In Esteban fully applies the law of resonance, with great wisdom, Solomon describes in these words:"The things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you
" <br /><br />Unforgettable Glenn Close playing splint, the tainted sister of Stephen, whose sin, driven by loneliness, spiritual and platonic love was the wife of his cruel snowy brother
Meryl Streep also brilliant, a woman whose name came to him like a glove Clara
With telekinetic powers, cognitive and mediumistic, this hardened woman, loyal to his blunt, conservative husband, is an indicator of character and self-control that we wish for ourselves and for all human beings
<br /><br />Every character is a portrait of virtuosity (as Blanca worthy rebel leader Pedro Segundo unhappy
) or a portrait of humiliation, like Stephen Jr
, the bastard child of Senator, who serves as an instrument for the return of the boomerang
<br /><br />The film moves the bowels, we recreated some facts that should not ever be repeated, but that absurdly still happen (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that, against all, life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende and immortalize just Bille August
Had this movie been made just a few years later, I would have knocked down the score a point or two because the sound quality was rather poor
At times, the movie appeared to be a silent film during the in-between-scenes (normal ambient sounds are missing)
But, given it was 1931 and a French movie, this is quite forgivable
Especially since this also occurs in later French films--by which time the sound difficulties should have been worked out completely (such as in L'Atalante from 1934)
<br /><br />Okay, apart from some minor sound problems, this is a cute little film about a missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it
And, during the search there are lots of jaunty little songs that you can't help but like
Deliverance is the fascinating, haunting and sometimes even disturbing tale by James Dickey, turned into a brilliant movie by John Boorman
It's about four businessmen, driven by manhood and macho-behavior, who're spending a canoeing weekend high up in the mountains
Up there, they're faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery
poverty, buggery and even physical harassment! These four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their trip soon changes into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountain-land, completely estranged from all forms of civilisation
All these elements actually make Deliverance one of the most nightmarish films I've ever seen
Just about everything that happens to these men, you pray that you'll never find yourself to be in a similar situation
Pure talking cinema, Deliverance is a very important movie as well
John Boorman's best (closely followed by Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film and it contains several memorable scenes that already featured in numberless other movies
Just think about the terrific "Duelling banjos" musical score and, of course, the unforgettable homosexual "squeal like a pig" rape scene
All the actors deliver (haha) perfect acting performances
In celebration of Earth Day Disney has released the film "Earth"
Stopping far short of any strident message of gloom and doom, we are treated to some excellent footage of animals in their habitats without feeling too bad about ourselves
<br /><br />The stars of the show are a herd of elephants, a family of polar bears and a whale and its calf
The narrative begins at the North Pole and proceeds south until we reach the tropics, all the while being introduced to denizens of the various climatic zones traversed
<br /><br />Global warming is mentioned in while we view the wanderings of polar bear; note is made of the shrinking sea ice islands in more recent years
We never see the bears catch any seals, but the father's desperate search for food leads him to a dangerous solution
<br /><br />The aerial shots of caribou migrating across the tundra is one of the most spectacular wildlife shots I ever saw; it and another of migrating wildfowl are enough to reward the price of admission to see them on the big screen
<br /><br />One of the disappointments I felt was that otherwise terrific shots of great white sharks taking seals were filmed in slow motion
Never do you get the sense of one characteristic of wild animals; their incredible speed
The idea of slowing down the film to convey great quickness I think began with (or at least it's the first I recall seeing) the television show "Kung Fu" during the early Seventies
<br /><br />An interesting sidelight is that as the credits roll during the end some demonstrations of the cinematographic techniques employed are revealed
There are enough dramatic, humorous and instructive moments in this movie to make it a solid choice for nature buffs
Perhaps because of some selective editing (sparing us, as it were, from the grisly end of a prey-predator moment) and the fact that this footage had been released in 2007 and is available on DVD it is a solid film in its own right
And you can take your kids!<br /><br />Three stars
A female executioner (played by the sexy Jennifer Thomas II) has the fun job of fulfilling all the fantasies of all the men on death row before they meet their maker
Lucky this film is not real, or we would have a lot more people in this world on death row
Low light and bad acting, like most (B) films
<br /><br />I would rate it very high on the low cost, very sexy movies of the 90's
It's a must see once the kids are away or in bed
With the current trend of gross out humor, this film is the granddaddy of them all
While some of the humor is dated, every skit will either shock, repulse, or make you laugh out loud
Most memorable is the sex games commentary and, of course, the VD commercial
It doesn't always work, but pays off when it does
It's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the, in this case, author of the novel
Of course this is not something that is typically Italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema, mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it
Cain's publishers managed to keep this movie off American screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic
<br /><br />The movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 American version but it's a great movie nevertheless
This of course not in the least is due to the movie it's great strong story, that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism
It follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story, with of course as a difference that it got set in an Italian environment
<br /><br />Leave it up to the Italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it
These early drama's always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch
Unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end, when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts
The movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier
<br /><br />Nevertheless, I don't really have much else negative to say about this movie
It's simply a greatly made one, based on some equally great and strong source material
Quite an impressive directorial debut for Luchino Visconti, who continued to direct some many more great and memorable Italian dramatic movies
What makes Midnight Cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which Joe Buck becomes bonded to Ratso Rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both
There really aren't many glimpses of hope in this film for either character, but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other
<br /><br />This film features Jon Voight's finest performance and probably Dustin Hoffman's as well
The rest of the cast is made up of unknowns, though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors, including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film
Also, for those interested, Andy Warhol's apprentice Paul Morrissey shows up briefly during the party scene
<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, it is essential
Brown of Harvard is a hard movie to pin down
We expect a lot more from our movies these days, so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20's were a bit more innocent
William Haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and, even, glory
All of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted EXCEPT for the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford, the town nerd
The movie has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sports
It's a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century
Another comment about this film made it sound lousy
Given talking pictures were so new - I think the script and acting were good
She had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect
Yet it is great to see her this way - still learning the craft
<br /><br />So many clichés came from this film and it seems, this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years
My vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was
Keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture, for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight
I love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments
Princess Victoria (Emily Blunt) is in line for the throne of England
The present King William (Jim Broadbent) is not well and may not live long
However, Vicky's scheming mother, The Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richandson) and her aide, John (Mark Strong) want to force Victoria to sign papers declaring them to be the "regents" until she is older, since she is only 20 years of age
The young lady refuses, despite John slapping her around
It is another sign that Victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country
Yet, when William does pass away, shortly after her 21st birthday, Victoria knows she has a heavy duty before her
First, she must surround herself with the "right" advisers to govern wisely
She chooses handsome Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) who, although an older man, is mentioned as a suitor for Vicky
Which brings us to the young queen's second major decision
Sooner than not, the young queen should select her future mate, as it will bring stability to her life and to those of the kingdom, for an heir must appear in the coming years
Meanwhile, in Germany, some distant relatives of the British royal family are hatching some plans as well
Handsome Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), of the Saxon-Coburg dynasty, is prodded by his father to court the young English royal
Once he arrives at the palace, he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual
But, since he is a minor player on the map of royal match-making, can he succeed in winning her heart? This is a lovely film, made even better by a completely winning performance by Emily Blunt as Victoria
Yes, she is beautiful but it is her intelligent reading of the role that scores mightily
Friend, too, does well, as do the other actors, including Broadbent, Richardson, Bettany, Strong (what a repulsive role!), and the rest
Also, the movie is gorgeously shot, costumed, and set, making it a visual treat in every way
If anything is lacking, it is an extra dose of dazzle, as the film seems a bit too straightforward and prosaic, at times, with a somewhat unimaginative edit
However, this is only a minor, minor point of argument in an overall very successful and gorgeous film
In short, young and old, should make time for Young Victoria
It is a most worthy film among 2009 cinematic offerings
I must admit - the only reason I bought this movie was because I am a big fan of Gackt and a *huge* fan of Hyde
I was expecting a good movie with a lot of shots that were, shall we say, pleasing to the feminine eye but a slightly cheesy story
I mean, the synopsis sounded really out there
And now that I have just finished watching it - I feel the need to tell the world of its brilliance! Hyde and Gackt both gave heart-wrenching performances, and my eyes are still hot from the crying that lasted throughout the last half of the movie
You get sucked into the story, and you really feel for the characters by the end
The element of vampirism - which I love, but is very easy to overdo or to ruin a movie with - is subtly mixed into the storyline as to make it something merely exotic, normal to this setting, rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story
and then I went back and tried to think of why I wasn't giving it that last point
After all - I'm not much of a critic - the fact that I'm bothering to write a review at all means I either really hate the movie or really love it
You can tell what side I'm on with Moon Child
I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this
In fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did
<br /><br />The film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time, one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that's going on behind the walls of the stadium
<br /><br />It makes you feel like you are in the movie and you're one of the characters, and while watching the movie, as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match
You will feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie
It's gripping in a way that you wanted to see the ending, you will want to find out the verdict, you'll be dying to see what will happen to the girls
<br /><br />I like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee
It's like venus VS mars, it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran
<br /><br />This is the second movie of Jafar Panahi that I have seen (the first being Crimson Gold) and am looking forward to watching some more
<br /><br />Am already hooked with Iranian movies and this one is a must-see
I have to say despite it's reviews Angels in the Outfield was a pretty good movie
I like the fact how it teaches kids to always have faith and never give up because yes miracles can happen
Unlike the other baseball movies this one particular movie stood out because of hits amazing special effects and well orchestrated soundtrack which was very interesting
Though I liked this movie it did have some flaws such as some irrelevancy (i
Towards the end when Ray Mitchell hits a homer he doesn't step on the plate and therefore that wouldn't be a score
) I have to say i was really impressed with this movie's presence and moral: Just have faith, Don't give up
This is a great, ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s' obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was
I can remember being freaked out by metal teens when I was a kid
It doesn't help that I found a desecrated grave in my hometown's graveyard when I was ten
Turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan
So maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile, but I love it now, as a 24 year old
<br /><br />I bought this DVD used for 6 bucks and I expected it to suck due to the lame cover, but to my surprise, it ruled
It is all about the extreme demonic power of metal
And you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd
This movie is awesome, if you love 80s metal and bad movies, this one's for you
I saw this movie on Comedy Central a few times
It's an interesting adventure with the life of Sunny Davis, who is arranged to marry the king of Ohtar, so that the U
can get an army base there to balance power in the Middle East
Ten out of ten was my rating for this movie
In some ways, The Wrath of Kriemhild surpasses Siegfried's Death, but it also loses some of that film's greatness
The plot of this one is more cohesive than the first, which is quite amazing
The second half of the actual poem is a lot sloppier and a lot harder to tread through, until, that is, you get to the climactic battle scenes; only the Iliad's are better
The poet-compiler of the Nibelungenlied didn't know a Hun from his right ball, and as a result they are, more or less, the same as the Burgundians in custom
For example, although the poet clearly describes Etzel as a heathen (which is Kriemhild's main concern as Rudiger tries to persuade her to marry him), when she gets to Hunland, the first thing she does is go to mass
The Huns here are clearly heathens; they're almost like caveman
The depiction of them is hilarious, especially Verbal, the jester, who has two marvelous scenes
Etzel's character has been given more weight
All he does is bemoan his fate in the original poem
Lang and Harbou are masterful at building suspense, especially at the banquet scene, which is intercut with Verbal's second performance to an amazing effect
However, as is the nature of this half of the poem, the film's amazing technical accomplishments are missing in this one, for the most part, except for a dazzling sequence where Etzel's hall burns down with the Nibelungs inside
The one thing I do have to object to is the way Harbou changes the ending
SPOILERS: in the poem, after Hildebrand captures Hagen and Gunther, they are imprisoned
Kriemhild visits Hagen in his cell and demands that he reveal where he has hidden the horde
He refuses and she herself decapitates her brother
When Hagen still refuses, she decapitates him
Hildebrand (or possibly Dietrich) is so disgusted that a woman would presume to murder a great warrior that he, in turn, decapitates her, calling her a "Devil Woman"
Etzel, who is much weaker in the poem than he is here, says something silly like: "Ah me!" I can understand why they would want to keep a unity of time and place as Hildebrand brings them from the castle; to retain the prison settings of the two deaths would make the film very anticlimactic
I also understand why they didn't have Hildebrand kill Kriemhild: his character is much reduced here; his name is only mentioned once
But, to have Kriemhild kill herself, adopting Brynhild's death from the Icelandic sources, is just catering to the audience instead of challenging them
The point of the poem is that Kriemhild's wrath goes far beyond it should into the realm of pure evil
Here, we simply have her die for her lost love
After having read two or three negative reviews on the main page of IMDb for "Pushing Daisies", and having literally minutes ago finished watching the final episode, I thought it was about time I said what I thought of PD
<br /><br />First off, to address what some of the issues that I have seen other people having with this show: something along the lines of "I expect the people who have been woken from the dead to have a more realistic reaction"
Realistic, on this show ? Pushing Daisies is, truly, pure and utter escapism
It's colour palette, the dialogue used, the scenarios, situations, music: all of it, to me, is just an escape from everyday life
It is here where Pushing Daisies exceeds exceptionally well Pushing Daisies isn't for everyone: A large majority of the television audience don't "get" it, for some people it's just too out there and silly
But for people like me, even from the first episode I watched of it (Season 2's "Frescorts") and I was just blown away by the show
From then on, I bought both the box sets and they have barely been out of my DVD player
Other people I know can't stand it, it really seems to be like Marmite
<br /><br />The show follows the adventures of Ned, the Piemaker, with a magic finger, who brings back childhood sweetheart Charlotte Charles, works in association with private investigator Emerson Cod, owns the Pie-hole and employs waitress Olive Snook
Completing the main cast members are aunts Lily and Vivian, whom Charlotte (Chuck) is never allowed to see
They live in a fantasy world where the dead are brought back to life, everything is shown with a wonderfully bright splash of colour, and narrated by Jim Dale
<br /><br />Other than outlining the basics of the show, I really can't praise it much more without saying: Just watch it
Despite being screwed over by the Writer's Guild of America strike, with only 22 episodes ever to be made, it provides wonderful plot twists, story lines, characters and situations while providing (for me) a satisfying ending (yes, I could tell it had been tacked on the end and rushed, but I was still happy with the way it went out)
Whether it is creative or just pretentious, for a lot of people (me included) it made the most addictive and wonderful viewing, and I hope for the future of television that more shows like this are created so I'm not left with just 22, 40 minute memories of what true entertainment can be
My friend had the idea of watching the animated LOTR after seeing the Peter Jackson Return of The King
So I finally bought it off e-bay, thinking right from the start it was going to suck
Actually, it really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be
The animation was good for its time, they used a unique method of blending live action with animation to create some interesting effects, and the guy who did the voice for Frodo sounded somewhat like Elijah Wood
<br /><br />Not the greatest adaptation of a book, but trust me, I've seen a lot worse
It skips quite a lot of things, since both Fellowship and The Two Towers are compressed into one two hour movie
Definatley worth a watch, kids might like, but still, absoutley no comparision with the Peter Jackson trilogy
I watched this film so many times through my child hood that even to this day i can pretty much re-sight all of the dialogue
And when I watch it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh
I think it's amazing how they managed to train animals especially the cat to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film
However watching it now I can also unfortunately notice that it isn't the masterpiece i once thought it was
But i prefer to remember how i felt about it when i was younger watching it on VHS on my fist TV that would cloud the image in yellow
And and bearing in mind it is a children's film, that is why i would still definitely give it 10/10
Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands, trying to make sense of what he's just done
Meanwhile, a CIA chief in NYC outlines the agency's response to what's just happened on screen
An American flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot, but as he speaks, it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory, as if it doesn't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security
<br /><br />This shot effectively captures the mood of the film
As well as portraying Bourne's quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security
<br /><br />It is also probably the best film you'll see in the cinema this year
Bourne says to Simon Ross (Considine) "This isn't some newspaper story, this is real" and in the audience you almost believe him
The camera shakes, but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you're there with Bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers, and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they're portraying, instead of just being actors performing well-written roles
The action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement; the stunt-work is nothing short of amazing
<br /><br />The pacing is just incredible
It keeps driving forward towards its conclusion, but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece
While they're often simple (the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone) they're charged with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them
The film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can't help being swept along by it
<br /><br />With its intense action set-pieces, brilliantly paced storyline, and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security, the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age
This Documentary (Now available free on Video
Com) is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice
<br /><br />Chavez was elected in a landslide vote in 1998
His platform was to divert the fantastic oil wealth from the 20% middle class to the 80% poor
He banned foreign drift net fishing in Venezuelan waters
He sent 10,000 Cuban doctors to the slums to treat the sick for free
He wiped out illiteracy and set up new free Universities
<br /><br />But it was his 30% tax on oil company profits that got him in trouble with the Bush administration
In 2002, while Irish film makers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were interviewing Chavez inside the Presidential Palace about his social programs, a CIA backed coup was launched
With the cameras rolling, Chavez was captured and flown out of the country
It was announced on national TV that he had 'resigned'
<br /><br />But the poor of Venezuela didn't believe the media
They went to the Palace in their millions and demanded that Chavez be returned
In the face of such overwhelming numbers, the military turned on the coup leaders and the plotters fled to the US
Chavez was rescued by military helicopter and returned to jubilation
That's what one of the girls said at the end
<br /><br />Is the soccer game a metaphor for a qualifying game between the girls (or more broadly, a free-thinking group) and the authority? "To Germany" means to a future that's of hope? <br /><br />It's one of the most unforgettable cinematic experience I've ever had -- despite the crude cinematography and plot, and mild over-acting (though I like the cast -- they're lovable and well above the expectation for amateurs)
The ridiculous situation is well captured
I can feel the deep frustration being denied to a game (being female and a soccer fan) and I cannot stop thinking how to make a convincing disguise
I wonder why there's no women's section in which protection from dirty language and bad behavior can be provided -- defeating the flawed reasons for the deny
<br /><br />The movie is very cleverly made -- the amazing title, the filming during the actual game, the spontaneity, and various methods to put the viewers into the shoes of the characters -- the game that's so important but inaccessible (not shown), the luring light and cheering sound from the stadium, the confinement of the van, and the uselessness of it when those inside connect with the celebrating crowds outside
I can feel the comfort coming from the radio, the drinks and the food, and of course, the kindness and consideration from each character to others
During the end credits, I am amused that no character has a name -- he's just any "soldier" and she's just any "girl" or "sister"
With the advent of the IMDb, this overlooked movie can now find an interested audience
Why? Because users here who do a search on two-time Academy Award winner Glenda Jackson can find 'The Return of The Soldier' among her credits
So can those checking out Oscar winner Julie Christie
Fans of Ann-Margret can give the title a click, as will those looking into the career of the great Alan Bates
Not to mention the added bonus of a movie with supporting heavyweights Ian Holm and Frank Finlay
Any movie with so many notables in it is rewarded by the IMDb, given all the cross-referencing that goes on here
So, why isn't this movie out on DVD? Don't the Producers realize the Internet Movie Database is a marketing gift for such a film? And 'The Return of The Soldier' is definitely a gem waiting to be discovered
One of the best love stories I have ever seen
It is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion, but lovely nonetheless
Big Edie and Little Edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly, and are infinitely quotable: "It's a goddamned beautiful day, now will you just shut up?" The opening explanation of Little Edie's costume only promises that the movie will live on forever, and so will Big Edie "The World Famous Singer" and Little Edie " The World Famous Dancer
Anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will empathize with this indie film's protagonist, a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet
Is Jake (a mesmerizing Anthony DeMarco) simply "transferring" the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image? Or could the creature be real? Writer/director Shelli Ryan neatly balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing
Her choice of using one setting - a suburban house - adds to the feeling of desperation and claustrophobia
<br /><br />Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are highly convincing as the angry, but loving parents
However it is the creepy minor characters, Mrs
Bender(Barbara Gruen), an unhinged babysitter and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a sleazy Real estate agent that linger in the mind
Jake's Closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of Hell
This is what the musical genre was made of
Humor, talent, romance, and action all rolled into one
Marlon Brando, although not a singer, did a great job winning the hearts of many with his portrayal of Sky Masterson
The fact that he couldn't sing added to his character
The ladies in the film were alright, but the men in the movie definitely stole the show
<br /><br />It is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age
It connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh
<br /><br />Definitely a movie to be watched and enjoyed
This movie wraps around the dinner table with a group of friends, some you like, some you don't
Their stories are not one smooth, happy with everyone and everything, type of life--much like real life
Some story lines do not evolve, they just happen
But like true families and good friends, they stick together
The wanna-be parents who are buying a baby are such a--holes! You are happy for the ending
Poor Delmar is stuck between a rock and a boulder taking care of herself, her mom, her son, and trying to keep all their lives together
This does not end with a sunset walk or house in the 'burbs and all are living in a dream world, but is a very real life portrayal of people living day to day, month to month
Overall, this is a good story and a great movie!
This is an excellent modern-day film noir
"excellent" in that it's interesting, start-to-finish
There are some holes in here and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief
but I haven't found anyone who didn't get caught up in this story
The movie has the right amount of action, suspense, plot twists and interesting characters
In addition, it sports some nice colors and cinematography plus a good guitar-based soundtrack
<br /><br />I labeled this crime movie a "film noir" because it's gritty and the all the characters are no good
Even the only supposed-good guy, played by Nicholas Cage, gets himself in trouble by lying and has a quick affair he should't have
He also does something at the end which isn't right, but I'm not going the spoil it by saying
Suffice to say, however, that the rest of the characters are so bad they make Cage look good!<br /><br />Speaking of "bad guys," does anyone do it better than Dennis Hopper? Not many
At least in the "deranged" category, he's tough to beat
Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to watch for a bunch of reasons
Walsh gives another great supporting performance, too
<br /><br />This is one of those films that never got much publicity, but it should have
By the way, try saying the name of this movie out loud three times fast without messing it up
Jim Carrey is good as usual, and even though there are quite a few "Jim Carrey moments", it's definitely not a "Jim Carrey movie"
<br /><br />It's targeted mostly at children, and I managed to enjoy it as such movie
It was promoted in Israel as another Jim Carrey movie, so those who expected a weird over the top comedy were disappointed
<br /><br />The movie has nice moments and works well as a movie for kids
I can't say I LOVED this movie, but then again I'm not its target audience
There are many police dramas doing the rounds
It's probably to do with the old basic theme of good versus evil
<br /><br />This film has a documentary style as we follow the difficult initiation of Anne, a raw recruit, into a police squad stationed in the Baltic area
No attempt is made to glamorise the police
They are truly down to earth, harsh at times and unforgiving, Anne on the other hand has a soft heart perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition
Against all rules she sometimes holds back incriminating information found on her strip searches and other investigations
There is not much feeling of optimism in it
The police seem to be involved in a losing battle
Tomorrow there will be more bashings, more murders, more family break-ups, and more distressed children
<br /><br />As days go by Anne becomes more intimately involved with the police and with the families they are investigating
The only real warmth in the film is that provided by the character Benny, a 12 year old from a broken family
Anne has her own way of patching things up
She turns a blind eye to Benny's shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can
I was surprised though that she went so far as to seduce Benny's father
It set me wondering if it was in consideration of the father or her own needs
After all, the film makes it clear that she was desperately in need of a partner and loving children
<br /><br />Well cast but not my idea of an evening's entertainment
As a producer of indie movies and a harsh critic of such, I have to say I loved this movie
It is funny and intelligent, well directed and entertaining
Hats off to the producers and directors for making a good one! I'll be watching for the next one
I did not intend to write this review, but having read the default review that shows up on this movie's URL, I felt compelled to write a rebuttal
It does not deserve the slanderous review that the writer has written
I think the writer has totally missed the point of the movie to a large extent
In fact, I too was turned off by the excessive show of Evangelist devotions that occupied the middle of the movie to a large extent
However, I must beg to differ with the reviewer in that, this movie in the end is not a propaganda piece for evangelist action
I think, what the director has shown is that how religion is not enough to find all the answers, how religion is to a large extent incapable of providing answers to basic, simple questions that one may ask and all that religion has to offer is sometimes just banal platitudes of one kind or another
This does not demonstrate a value judgment on religion as we have to remember that religion is transmuted and expressed by ordinary, mostly well meaning, basically good people and they usually have no monopoly on truth and thus religion can not in the end provide the ultimate answers to some questions in life
You have to take it on faith and that's all
And if you are given to faith, then you can appreciate any show of faith
And if you are not given to faith then any show of faith is tiresome
It is thus at the same time, instructive to note the reviewer reaction to the movie
In any case, the director shows us that one can choose not to accept the religious interpretation of events and answers to questions and in spite of that life goes on and there are 'secret sunshine' in this world that awaits all wounded souls, regardless of their religious orientation
And that's just the core message of the film! Please note the last scene of the movie, if you don't get this! In the end, the movie is a great one and very thought provoking and confronts you - the viewer with questions that you have to answer for yourself
Thus it is a work of art that is challenging to you personally
I do agree with the reviewer in that, the Evangelical stuff was a bit too much
However, given the above interpretation of religion as shown in the movie, I think the director was trying to balance the act whereby he might not be called an Evangelist  basher! The actor Kang-ho Song was great as always
He's so balanced and just perfect that he's just amazing
I know the actress Do-yeon Jeon got the Cannes award for best actress for this movie
However, I did not find any specialty in her acting
It seems that to get awards you just have to act really convincingly in crying and hysterical scenes and all All in all a great movie
If you don't like it  please watch it again and see if you get it! If it leaves you dissatisfied or uncomfortable or asking questions then think, if that was not what the director was actually aiming at through this movie in the first place
The plot is a little too complicated--I tried to summarize it three times and I can't
The movie is funny, beautiful--the plot is totally unrealistic but it works
Everybody in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great--it creates a sweet, romantic feel through the entire film
<br /><br />The acting is great--Robert Downey Jr
and Cybill Shepherd are in top form and enjoying every second of it
Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are just OK but fine
If you're a sucker for good, sweet sentimental films (like me), catch this one
Also Downey looks great in his underwear!<br /><br />Extra bonuses--the title song sung by Johnny Mathis and another great song "After All" sung by Cher and Peter Cetera
EA have shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60's world
The graphics of the game are outstanding and also the voice recording is very professional
I got this game April 2007 (two years after release), and I am still impressed with the gameplay
It's a shame that EA will no longer make 007 games
<br /><br />I give this game 10/10 for the levels it contains, especially the "consulate" level
I would recommend this game to anyone from the age of 13 and over
The only thing I didn't like in the game is the Russian boat level, it was too much pressure
I stopped watching it for years, but about two weeks ago I started back watching it again
Now my kids watch the show and they love to watch it as well
My kids can't believe that DJ , on the show, and I are the same age
<br /><br />I really love the show, because it is a show you can watch with your family
It has good teachings your kids can learn from
Also there isn't any drugs and violence on it
Also when the kids, on the show, have a problem they can always open up to their family for help
That's the message kids should be getting from TV now a days, turn to your family for help, not to drugs
Kids should be watching more shows like Full House instead of half the mess on TV now a days
<br /><br />I also love the show because it makes you laugh and it is down to earth
It talks about real life problems and family matters
There is always a lesson you can learn from the show
In my honest opinion, everyone should see this movie at least once
It really put things in perspective as I watched it
Though it was fictional, this movie is about something that could happen to your children
<br /><br />It shows how easily two kids can hide both their hatred for their school, and their plans to murder innocent students
This film would not have worked in any other format
They pulled off the hand-held camera, perfectly
<br /><br />It reminds us of April 20th, 1999, when Eric Harris, and Dylan Klebold murdered 12 students and then themselves
It also reminds us of the media storm that followed after
Everyone wanted to see the Rampart video and everyone wanted to see the Basement tapes
<br /><br />This movie is a fictional version of our dreams coming true
<br /><br />The only bad thing about this movie, is that it did not do well on the market, and few people even know it existed
If it would have had a single preview on a single blockbuster movie, everyone would have gone to see what the big deal was about, Zero Day
<br /><br />I believe this is the best film adaptation of a school shooting of the few that have truly attempted it
The shooting itself only takes up about ten minutes of the hour and a half long film, because It mostly focuses on Cal and Andre, and what they did up to that point
<br /><br />If you have not yet seen this movie, go rent it, and watch it
I guarantee that when it is finished, you will be speechless
This interesting Giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways
Miraglia who, one year earlier, also made the very interesting "La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba" (see also my comment on that one), the film starts off a little slow, but all in all, no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences
<br /><br />This film is a German-Italian coproduction, but it was released in Germany on video only in a version trimmed by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title "Horror House"
At least the murder scenes, which will satisfy every gorehound, are fully intact, and the viewer still gets the killer's motive at the end
But the Italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for, of course
<br /><br />A convincing Giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte" is highly recommended to Giallo fans and slightly superior to Miraglia's above mentioned other thriller
This is about a mad scientist who creates a half shark - half man type critter on an uncharted island, then calls up all his old business and academic buddies to come and see his creation (evil laugh) but actually he wants his sharkman to kill them! Lots of bad GCI, goofy plot elements, and babes sweating in tight T-shirts follow
<br /><br />These monster movies all follow a similar formula, but this one spices things up with a bit of humor (I guarantee the folks who made this had tongues firmly planted in cheek), not to mention the sexy babes
But let's mention those sexy babes - several hot babes, in tight T-shirts, sweating profusely
One's in her undies at the beginning, another at the end
Thank you, thank you, makers of bad movies! The plot is full of goofy stuff, a guy drives up in a jeep, slams it right into a tree, then offers to fly everyone off the island in a helicopter
Yeah, um, well, how 'bout we think about that for a while; we'll get back to you
The sharkman is hilarious - either awful CGI or an equally comedic guy in a rubber suit
The mad scientist gives a pretty good performance; he's evil, that's his motivation, he makes no apologies
<br /><br />Overall, if you want a stupid, FUN B-movie, this one should do the job
Although the story is fictional, it draws from the reality of not only the history of latin american countries but all the third world
This is the true, pure and raw recent history of these countries summarized concisely in this novel / film
The offbeat supranatural stuff, lightens up the intensity of historical events presented in this movie
After all the supranatural stuff is a part of the culture in the third world
Although is not critically acclaimed (probably because of the supranatural stuff), This is an excellent movie, with a great story and great acting
This film captured my heart from the very beginning, when hearing Quincy Jones' first notes or seeing the wonderful color of purple of the flowers in the meadows
! The whole cast gives the best performance in a film I've seen in years and Spielberg has really outdone himself! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey(oh lord!), Danny Glover, and the others, all give us their best and you can feel it - almost touch it! Goldberg IS Celie, she gives her that insecurity and feeling of inferiority that is needed for the character, and we grow with her, we grow strong together with her, throughout the movie, and we triumph with her
Margaret Avery is wonderful as Shug Avery, even when she's at her most arrogant, and shows us that "sinners", indeed, "have souls too"
The always sympathetic, charming Danny Glover makes a marvellous job at making people hate him and the magnificent music of(I'd say sir)Quincy Jones adds even more beauty to this splendid film! The photography, the music, the director and the music makes this beautiful, soulful movie into an experience of life
"Men of honor" - true story about a proud and persistent black navy diver (fabulous Cuba Gooding Jr
) is definitely a great movie that both touches and entertains and it's part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema
Wonderful acting is the main reason to make this movie something truly special and pretty enjoyable, splendid experience
Charismatic Robert De Niro is marvelous as rough, fierce and pitiless chief Billy Sunday - role is practically written for him
This film alongside with fantastic "15 minutes" (2001) are two of the latest proofs that he's still one of the very finest actors of our time
On the other hand "Men of honor" includes a fine performance from Cuba Gooding Jr
who has been one of the most promising young black actors since "Boyz n the hood"
"Men of honor" goes straight into the company of "Jerry Maguire", "As good as it gets" and "Instinct"
is a skillful and fantastic actor and I'm prepared to get lots of more terrific movies from him
"Men of honor" has also quite an excellent story-line and probably the most exciting diving sequences of the movie history
This is a great, fascinating movie and I can only recommend it
As a biographical film, "The Lady With Red Hair" (the story of how director /producer/playwright David Belasco transformed notorious society divorcee Mrs
Leslie Carter into an international stage star) is certainly not in a league with that other Warner's biopic of similar vintage, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (what is?), but "Lady" is an enjoyable film in its own right--AND shares quite a few traits in common with the Cagney classic
<br /><br />Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy," "The Lady With Red Hair" brims over with old -time show-business flavor
(Among other things, both films feature delicious theatrical boarding-house sequences as well as the inevitable scenes set backstage and in theatrical managers' offices
) Also, in "Lady" as in the Cohan biopic, the supporting cast is made up of familiar and beloved character actors of the period, all doing the sort of top-notch work we remember them for
<br /><br />Need I add that, again like "Yankee Doodle Dandy," "The Lady With Red Hair" doesn't let the truth get in the way of telling a good story? But, also like "Dandy," "Lady" does manage--gloriously!--to convey the esssence of its show-business-giant hero's larger-than-life personality
Everyone knows that Cagney limned Cohan for all time in his brilliant and affectionate portrayal in "Yankee Doodle Dandy"--but few moviegoers realize that Claude Rains did a similar service for David Belasco in "The Lady With Red Hair"- -and did it with a panache that almost equals Cagney's
<br /><br />Rains-as-Belasco perfectly captures that legendary showman's galvanic personality in all its outsized glory
Rains gives a tremendously enjoyable , superbly observed, and remarkably true-to-life performance as the man all Broadway once called "The Wizard
" To watch Claude Rains in action (looking in every shot as if he's having a helluva good time!) in "The Lady With Red Hair" is to see David Belasco leap to life on film as if he can't wait to shake things up on the Main Stem once again
In Brooklyn a century ago, the rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and their competing volunteer fire brigades leads to Brodie's famous bet that he can jump off the Brooklyn Bridge
This is a story which will be familiar to a lot of people through a Bugs Bunny spoof, "Bowery Bugs" from 1949
<br /><br />This generally very enjoyable film would probably be more widely available if it were not for the notorious and unsettling scene involving some Chinese tenement dwellers -- a time capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes, giving the film a great deal of historical interest, in my view
`The United States of Kiss My Ass'<br /><br />House of Games is the directional debut from playwright David Mamet and it is an effective and at times surprising psychological thriller
It stars Lindsay Crouse as best-selling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide
In doing so she leaves the safety and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels `downtown' to visit the lowlife place, House of Games
<br /><br />The gambler Mike (played excellently by Joe Mantegna) turns out to be somewhat sharp and shifty
He offers Crouse's character a deal, if she is willing to sit with him at a game, a big money game in the backroom, he'll cancel the patients debts
The card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work (gaining the trust of others) and a fascinating relationship begins
What makes House of Games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control, is it the psychiatrist or the con-man or is it the well-known man of great bluffs David Mamet
<br /><br />In House of Games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring, however in every David Mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings, not the direction
In House of Games this shines through in part thanks to the superb performances from the two leads (showy and distracting) but mainly as is the case with much of Mamet's work, it is the dialogue, which grips you and slowly draws you into the film
No one in the House of Games says what they mean and conversations become battlegrounds and war of words
Everyone bluffs and double bluffs, which is reminiscent of a poker games natural order
This is a running theme throughout the film and is used to great effect at the right moments to create vast amounts of tension
House of Games can also be viewed as a `class-war' division movie
With Lindsay Crouse we have the middle-class, well-to-do educated psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the complete opposite, the working class of America earning a living by `honest' crime
<br /><br />The film seduces the viewer much like Crouse is seduced by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema
And the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for, it's stunning
<br /><br />An extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings
I claim no matter how hard I seek I'll never find a better movie version of "Othello"
If you love Kenneth Branagh's magnificent masterpieces "Much ado about nothing" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996) as much as I do I'm dead certain you'll also find Oliver Parker's "Othello" irresistible
Laurence Fishburne has been in a various splendid roles during his career
He was quite terrific in "Boys n the hood" (1991) - I've always considered his amusing role of Furious Styles as his very greatest achievement
That was, of course, way before I saw this
<br /><br />He plays the part of Othello and he is probably in the most challenging role of his whole career but he does a brilliant, fantastic job
Irène Jacob is absolutely charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is just simply phenomenal in a most fascinating role of the story's crooked, manipulate villain Iago
Marvelous "Othello" is part of the absolute elite among Shakespeare's ingenious works
It deals with his favorite topics: crookedness, envy, deceitfulness and jealousy
This movie adaptation is certainly one of the finest films I've seen that's based on William Shakespeare's plays
Some unsuspecting films carry a message that resonates in the hours and days after viewing
Such is the case for CAROL'S JOURNEY (EL VIAJE DE CAROL), a beautifully crafted 2002 film from Spain based on the novel 'A boca de noche' by Ángel García Roldán who also adapted the book as a screenplay
War and its consequences are not new subject matter for films, but when that war theme plays in the background as a subtle driving force to develop characters (especially children) who must face adult life influenced by the games of adults, the result is a different and more tender examination of the coming of age film genre
<br /><br />Carol (Clara Lago) is a 12-year-old Spanish American youngster from New York who with her critically ill mother Aurora (María Barranco) returns to her Aurora's home in 1938 at the height of the Spanish Civil War, a home that has been left deserted by her father Don Amalio (Álvaro de Luna) since his wife's death
Carol's father Robert (Ben Temple) is a fighter pilot who has sided with the Republicans against Franco and is rarely with his family
Aurora has a past: she left her lover Alfonso (Alberto Jiménez) to marry Robert, and Alfonso in turn married Aurora's cold sister Dolores (Lucina Gil)
Carol is an independent girl who remains aloof to all but her grandfather Don Amalio until she meets others her age but not of her 'class': Tomiche (Juan José Ballesta) and his two friends at first resent Carol, but as events develop Carol and Tomiche are bonded by what feels like the first awakenings of love
When Aurora dies of her illness, Carol must live with Alfonso and Dolores and their daughter Blanca (Luna McGill), yet turns to her grandfather for support and to her mother's best friend and teacher Maruja (the always radiant Rosa Maria Sardà) to understand the disparity between classes and the senseless war that keeps her beloved father from her side
Through a series of incidents Carol and Tomiche learn the rigors of becoming adults, facing more traumas in a brief period of the war than most of us experience in a lifetime
The ending, though sad, is uplifting as Carol's journey to maturity is complete
<br /><br />The film is shot in Galicia and Portugal and contains some extraordinarily beautiful settings captured with gentle sensitive lighting by cinematographer Gonzalo F
Berridi and enhanced by the musical score by Bingen Mendizábal
Director Imanol Uribe understands the fine line separating pathos from bathos, and in electing to concentrate the story on the children involved, he makes an even stronger statement about the futility and cruelty of war
The cast is exceptional: the stars clearly are young Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta, but they are supported by the fine veteran actors in the adult roles
This is a visually stunning work with a lasting message and should find a much larger audience than it has to this date
The notion of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is tacky
The ending is not just a fitting one, it's more inspirational
<br /><br />But I am intrigued by the characters
It is a pity we never see the relationship of Achilles and Athena more developed beyond just a couple of kisses and Athena's fear for Achilles's safety
Friz Freleng's 'Rumours' is an excellent Private Snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic-inducing rumours during wartime
Produced, as were all the Snafu shorts, to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films, 'Rumours' is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan
When Snafu starts a rumour about a bombing, it escalates into an eventual rumour that America has lost the war
This is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long, rubbery piece of baloney and several strange, fictional creatures who come back to haunt Snafu with ever more terrible news about his country's military
'Rumours' is inventive, fast paced and funny, all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured, "don't badmouth the military" message
It stands up as one of the best of the Private Snafu shorts
Kurt Russell is at his best as the man who lives off his past glories, Reno Hightower
Robin Williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance as Jack Dundee
He dropped the Big Pass in more ways than one
<br /><br />You'll see some of the most quotable scenes ever put into one film, as Jack hisses at a rat, Reno poses, and the call of the caribou goes out
<br /><br />Don't miss this classic that isn't scared to show football in the mud the way it should be played
Of course there were artistic licenses taken, but some of what you saw in this film go on in some colleges
<br /><br />I went to colleges in Southern California where the races pretty much hang around with their own
It's funny because these are schools that want racial unity, equality etc
But the thing is when class lets out, or when they're just hanging out waiting for class, they (students) seem to just hang around with people of their own race or ethnicity
But like the school paper of one of the schools I attended once wrote about that, "we should all try to hang around with students of other ethnicities and try to know them
" Otherwise you're creating your own segregation
<br /><br />Racism certainly existed in one of those schools I attended
One time someone put leaflets around campus talking about the glories of the Aryan Race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations
Fortunately, nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young Caucasian man went off and started shooting at a multiculturalism gathering
<br /><br />I can only hope and pray that nothing like that ever will happen
<br /><br />So is "Higher Learning" overly dramatic? Exaggerated? Maybe
Is it way "off mark?" It depends on where you went to or go to school
The race thing where the ethnicities just hang around with their own DOES happen
Minus the Hollywood exaggerations, the race thing hit pretty close to home for me
Based on Christy Brown's autobiographical novel, this endearing film tells the story of his life, him being affected by cerebral palsy and being considered basically not a person by everyone including his mother
Amazingly, he teaches himself to draw and write using his foot, which is the only part of him he can control
An amazing story of courage with a truly amazing and unforgettable oscar winning performance by Daniel Day Lewis
Ghost Train is a fine and entertaining film, typical of the better British comedy chillers of the 1930s and 40s
The antics of comedian Arthur Askey are not as funny as they once apparently were, but this can be overcome by viewing him as a period piece or a curiosity
<br /><br />For a low-budget wartime production, Ghost Train is atmospheric, effective, and it provides some genuine suspense
Great fun for a dark (and, yes, stormy) night
Lighten up, take off the critic's hat, and enjoy
it's a weekend i've been watched this funny film
all the kids are cute, who remind me of my own childhood with those stupid thinking
it's a real entertaining movie for a group of families at weekend night, which could make lots of memories and laughters
nice job for directer to find the kid's way
when it comes to the kid movie, i think of "12 and holding"
another one this year but differed aspect to the kid's world, which is real and cruel
H2EFW focuses on the happy side of childhood, which every kid and family need
Twitch, i think, is the voice of Nemo from "Finding Nemo"
At the height of the 'Celebrity Big Brother' racism row in 2007 ( involving Shilpa Shetty and the late Jade Goody ), I condemned on an internet forum those 'C
' fans who praised the show, after years of bashing 'racist' '70's sitcoms such as 'Curry & Chips' & 'Love Thy Neighbour'
I thought they were being hypocritical, and said so
'It Ain't Half Hot Mum' was then thrown into the argument, with some pointing out it had starred an English actor blacked-up
Well, yes, but Michael Bates had lived in India as a boy, and spoke Urdu fluently
The show's detractors overlook the reality he brought to his performance as bearer 'Rangi Ram'
The noted Indian character actor, Renu Setna, said in a 1995 documentary 'Perry & Croft: The Sitcoms' that he was upset when he heard Bates had landed the role, but added: "No Indian actor could have played that role as well as Bates
<br /><br />'Mum' was Perry and Croft's companion show to 'Dad's Army'; also set in wartime, the sedate English town of Walmington-On-Sea had been replaced by the hot, steamy jungles of India, in particularly a place called Deolali, where an army concert party puts on shows for the troops, among them Bombadier Solomons ( George Layton, his first sitcom role since 'Doctor In Charge' ), camp Gunner 'Gloria' Beaumont ( Melvyn Hayes ), diminutive Gunner 'Lofty' Sugden, 'Lah de-dah' Gunner Graham ( John Clegg ), and Gunner Parkins ( the late Christopher Mitchell )
Presiding over this gang of misfits was the bellicose Sergeant-Major Williams ( the brilliant Windsor Davies ), who regarded them all as 'poofs'
His frustration at not being able to lead his men up the jungle to engage the enemy in combat made him bitter and bullying ( though he was nice to Parkins, whom he thought was his illegitimate son! )
Then there was ever-so English Colonel Reynolds ( Donald Hewlett ) and dimwitted Captain Ashwood ( Michael Knowles )
Rangi was like a wise old sage, beginning each show by talking to the camera and closing them by quoting obscure Hindu proverbs
He loved being bearer so much he came to regard himself as practically British
His friends were the tea-making Char Wallah ( the late Dino Shafeek, who went on to 'Mind Your Language' ) and the rope pulling Punka Wallah ( Babar Bhatti )
So real Indians featured in the show - another point its detractors ignore
Shafeek also provided what was described on the credits as 'vocal interruptions' ( similar to the '40's songs used as incidental music on 'Dad's Army' )
Each edition closed with him warbling 'Land Of Hope & Glory' only to be silenced by a 'Shut Up!' from Williams
The excellent opening theme was penned by Jimmy Perry and Derek Taverner
<br /><br />Though never quite equalling 'Dad's Army' in the public's affections, 'Mum' nevertheless was popular enough to run for a total of eight seasons
In 1975, Davies and Estelle topped the charts with a cover version of that old chestnut 'Whispering Grass'
They then recorded an entire album of old chestnuts, entitled ( what else? ) 'Sing Lofty!'
<br /><br />The show hit crisis point three years later when Bates died of cancer
Rather than recast the role of 'Rangi', the writers just let him be quietly forgotten
When George Layton left, the character of 'Gloria' took his place as 'Bombadier', providing another source of comedy
<br /><br />The last edition in 1981 saw the soldiers leave India by boat for Blighty, the Char Wallah watching them go with great sadness ( as did viewers )
<br /><br />Repeats have been few and far between ( mainly on U
Gold ) all because of its so-called 'dodgy' reputation
For one thing, the show was not specifically about racism
If a white man blacked-up is so wrong, why does David Lean's 1984 film 'A Passage to India' still get shown on television? ( it featured Alec Guinness as an Indian, and won two Oscars! )
It was derived from Jimmy Perry's own experiences
Some characters were based on real people ( the Sergeant-Major really did refer to his men as 'poofs' )
I take the view that if you are going to put history on television, get it right
Sanitizing the past, no matter how unsavoury it might seem to modern audiences, is fundamentally dishonest
'Mum' was both funny and truthful, and viewers saw this
As Williams would say: "I'll have no gossiping in this jungle!
The Marriage of Maria Braun (MMB) is about a German girl (Maria) getting married to a German soldier (Herman Braun) just at the ending of the war
After being married for half a day and a night, Herman is send to the front again
To make ends meet, Maria starts working at a bar for mainly American soldiers and get to know a black soldier
She got word that Herman died at the front, and things develop between her and the American soldier
Herman walks in on them, in bed, and after a confrontation between him and the American, Maria killed the American
Herman admits to the murder, ends up in jail and Maria vows to wait for him
The country is in shambles; one sees people leaving everything that they are busy with for a cigarette
It is in short, a time of survival of the fittest
<br /><br />Basically this film projects Maria's attitudes - those attitudes she permits herself under the mentioned circumstances, as a metaphor for Germany's loss of soul after they lost the war, and how it proceeds to rebuild itself
For example, Maria has the following conversation with a peddler (played by Fassbinder himself); the peddler tries to sell her an excellent copy of Kleist and she remarks that "Kleist burns out to quickly, it does not provide enough heat for the cold"
The peddler answers "That's another way to look at it
Right now, it's probably the correct way"
<br /><br />Maria meets a French/German business man, Karl Oswald after she bargains her way into the first class train compartment
She decides to get involve with Karl, "You're not having an affair with me; I'm having an affair with you"
She also takes responsibility in the company, and after a while has the complete trust of the firm
When Karl says "I suppose we'll just have to wait for a miracle" she replies "I prefer making miracles  then wait for them"
In her own words, she has become the "Mata Hari of the economic miracle"
<br /><br />In a lot of Fassbinder's films he tried to expose the psychological processes which lie behind social mechanisms (see Freud); in other words, he liked pointing his camera at the bullsh*t, the false social mechanisms, the pretending
The direct approach Maria takes in this film is successful to convey this ideology
For example, she phones Karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point "I need someone to sleep with"
As Fassbinder said "the emotions people felt did not exist at all and were only a kind of sentimentality which we thought we needed to be properly functioning members of society"
He also remarked that his films are anti emotional
<br /><br />I particularly liked the scene when Karl and Maria meet in the Munich restaurant (apparently, frequently visited by Hitler himself)
Maria appears in control and Karl a bit on the down side, as if Maria's 'brutal honesty' wears him out, as if he is not completely up to the situation anymore
Karl says "I have to tell myself over and over that I love life"
And then we go out to eat and talk about food"
I guess this is also about Fassbinder attitudes on relationships, to never submit completely to anyone
And why would you, if the central matter of most of his films is about "What love becomes in this society  a commodity, an instrument of power, a weapon
"<br /><br />It was remarked that it is typical Fassbinder to have the scenes with Maria and Betti walking in expensive dresses in the ruins after the war - with these clothing essentially the wrong period
What I think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes, when you feel bad, that "you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great"
But, Fassbinder was not interested in perfection
Any mistakes made in a film could just be corrected in the next project
Since he completed films (approximately 4 a year) the way other people rolled cigarettes, it is not peculiar that this film has some very bad scenes
Peter Marthesheimer, who wrote most of the script, mentioned that Fassbinder likely dreamed up the whole scene with Maria and the American in the park, overnight
<br /><br />Hanna Schygulla is brilliant as Maria
Mostly, she just stares bluntly into the camera
In Maria's own words "It is a bad time for emotions
<br /><br />There are different opinions about the end
After Karl died of a hart attack, Herman finally shows up
(Herman left for Australia after he got out of prison, to "become human again"
) After the testament is delivered (made out to her and Herman in half), Maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette, and blow her and Herman up
For me it is obvious that she just did that by accident
At the same time, she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true
She must have felt as if she was not herself anymore
I rented this expecting something not too bad to spend an evening
It turned out a particularly satisfying experience
Some scenes were hilarious and managed to be so in a movie not intended to be just a stupid slapstick comedy but with some meaning and moral values
The leads are all good but especially the guy who stars,also wrote and produced the movie
I've never seen any of these actors before, but they were likable and made me care about what happens to them in the end which is saying a lot
The script is clever and involving and has a refreshing feel to it
I think you wont be disappointed to watch this
Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) is a successful dentist, who shares his practice with other business partners
Alan also has an loving wife (Jada Pinkett Smith) and he has two daughter (Camille LaChe Smith & Imani Hakim)
He also let his parents stay in his huge apartment in New York City
But somehow, he feels that his life is somewhat empty
One ordinary day in the city, he sees his old college roommate Charlie Fireman (Adam Sandler)
When Alan tries to befriends with Charlie again
Charlie is a lonely depressed man, who hides his true feelings from people who cares for him
Since Charlie unexpectedly loses his family in a plane crash, they were on one of the planes of September 11, 2001
When Alan nearly feels comfortable with Charlie
When Alan mentions things of his past, Charlie turns violent towards Alan or anyone who mentions his deceased family
Now Alan tries to help Charlie and tries to make his life a little easier for himself
But Alan finds out making Charlie talking about his true feelings is more difficult than expected
<br /><br />Written and Directed by Mike Bender (Blankman, Indian Summer, The Upside of Anger) made an wonderfully touching human drama that moments of sadness, truth and comedy as well
Sandler offers an impressive dramatic performance, which Sandler offers more in his dramatic role than he did on Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love
Pinkett Smith is fine as Alan's supportive wife, Liv Tyler is also good as the young psychiatrist and Saffron Burrows is quite good as the beautiful odd lonely woman, who has a wild crush on Alan
This film was sadly an box office disappointment, despite it had some great reviews
The cast are first-rate here, the writing & director is wonderful and Russ T
Alsobrook's terrific Widescreen Cinematography
The movie has great NYC locations, which the film makes New York a beautiful city to look at in the picture
<br /><br />DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2
35:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5
DVD also an jam session with Sandler & Cheadle, an featurette, photo montage and previews
I was expecting more for the DVD features like an audio commentary track by the director and deleted scenes
"Reign Over Me" is certainly one of the best films that came out this year
I am sure, this movie looked great in the big screen
Which sadly, i haven't had a chance to see it in a theater
But it is also the kind of movie that plays well on DVD
The film has an good soundtrack as well and it has plenty of familiar faces in supporting roles and bit-parts
Even the director has a bit-part as Byran Sugarman, who's an actor himself
"Reign Over Me" is one of the most underrated pictures of this year
It is also the best Sandler film in my taste since "The Wedding Singer"
Quite simply the best reality show ever made
The first two seasons (the only ones that matter) are on Hulu
I challenge anyone to watch the first three episodes of season 1 and not like it
I guarantee you will finish watching the season
Then I guarantee that you will watch season 2
<br /><br />Other quick reasons to watch it: 1
In one episode a player responds to another player's desperate, "I'm trying as hard as I can!" with an equally desperate, "Not necessarily
It's hard to say sometimes why exactly a film is so effective
From the moment I first came across "The Stone Boy", something told me it would be a great film
In spite of that, it seemed very unlikely that I'd ever have the opportunity to actually see it for myself
Then, one day, while looking through the online catalogue of my local library, I saw that they had recently purchased the DVD release of this film
Which I'm extremely glad for, because the cinematography is of a stunning depth and quality that an old VHS copy could never replicate
<br /><br />And speaking of the cinematography, I must single it out as far and above the most stunning aspect of this film
As a photographer who pursues very nearly the exact visual style portrayed in "The Stone Boy", I'm a firm believer in the fact that a great cinematographer can almost single-handedly carry a film
Here, he has a lot of help from an extremely talented cast, and a director who understands perfectly what the story needs
But to have Juan Ruiz Anchía behind the camera makes virtually every scene something of beauty
Most films would never even expect such a thing of you
Scene after scene captures some detail, some little bit of visual magic that takes your breath away
<br /><br />The director, Christopher Cain, has had a long and interesting career
As far as I can gather, this film is not very representative of it
But, sometimes, to catch a director near the beginnings of his career, before all the big budgets and loss of focus, there's a real subtle magic to be found
Cain steps back in this film, lets things happen with a life of their own, and then ever further
Much like early John Sayles films, characters are given space to breathe, time to talk
Side stories happen because they do, and that's how life is
Cain displays a remarkable, raw, even outright painful understanding of human nature in this film
<br /><br />The acting ties much of this story together
When people talk, when they exist in this film, they do so as actual people, not held back by the fact that they are playing characters
Gina Berriault's script allows immensely talented and respected actors like Wilford Brimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Frederic Forrest to spend time simply existing
Whether the things they have to say are minor or of deep significance, it all comes down with the weight of pure reality
<br /><br />When you look at the actors involved, or the great soundtrack by James Horner, it seems strange that such a film be very nearly forgotten
Maybe much of what makes "The Stone Boy" what it is was the time period it was made in
There's this 1970s hangover feeling to this picture that reminds me deeply of my own childhood
People talk of the 80s in terms of modern styles and music, but that's not the 80s I lived in or remember
The look of the images, the understated and dark knowing quality of the acting, and the overall result should get under the skin of any person who grew up in or near this era of time in North America
And a film like "The Stone Boy" sees the world for how it truly is
<br /><br />For more of this feeling, please see:<br /><br />The Black Stallion (1979), Never Cry Wolf (1983), Tender Mercies (1983), Testament (1983), Places in the Heart (1984), Matewan (1987), High Tide (1987), Driving Miss Daisy (1989), The Secret Garden (1993), The Secret of Roan Inish (1994), Wendy and Lucy (2008
(You'll know what I mean after you've seen Red Eye
) <br /><br />Overall, Red Eye was a better-than-expected thriller
It gets off to a slow start, and slowly builds
But by the time it was over, it's a thumper! <br /><br />It's hard to exactly define what makes this thriller as
Except that, simply put, the director did a creditable job of pulling you into the action of what would otherwise have been a run-of-the-mill plot
I rather tended to forget I was watching a movie
<br /><br />Other factors, I think, are the "closeness" of victim and bad guy
and that over time, you begin to really relate to the victim
I saw this movie first on the Berlin Film Festival, and I had never seen Hong Kong cinema before
I felt like sitting in a roller coaster: the action was so quick, and there wasn't one boring moment throughout the film
It has martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic plot
My favorite scene is when the Taoist drinks, sings and fights for himself - one of the many scenes which stress the extraordinary musical component of the movie
While a 9 might seem like an unusually high score for such a slight film, however, compared to the hundreds and hundreds of series detective films from the 1930s and 40s, this is among the very best and also compares very favorably to Powell's later "Thin Man" films
Now this does NOT mean that the film is that similar to the Thin Man movies, as THE KENNEL MURDER CASE is not a comedy but more a traditional mystery-detective film
Now you'd think that not having Nora Charles or Asta or a traditional comic sidekick (something found in practically all series detective films) along for fun would be a detriment, but I didn't miss them at all because this was such an exceptionally well-written film--having a genuinely interesting case as well as uniformly excellent performances by all
<br /><br />The film begins at the dog show and is called The KENNEL Murder Case, though this Philo Vance film actually spends little of the time at the dog show and dogs are not a super-important part of the film
Instead, a thoroughly hated man is killed and left in a completely sealed room--an idea repeated in quite a few other detective films (such as CRIME DOCTOR'S STRANGEST CASE)
However, how all this is explained seems pretty credible and fit together very well--keeping my interest throughout
I sure wish other detective films of the day had as intelligently written plots and exceptional acting as this one
Gorgeous Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a television reporter who travels with her crew (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) to Solvang, California, to cover a Danish festival
The problem is that their accommodations have fallen through and all hotels in town are full
So they travel out of town to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly Ernest Keller (a phenomenal Sydney Lassick)
Wouldn't you know it, Ernest and meek partner Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) are hiding a big secret in their cellar: pitiable, deformed, diaper-clad "Junior" (Stephen Furst, in a remarkable performance) who ultimately terrorizes the girls
<br /><br />A deliciously unhinged Lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie
It builds slowly but surely to an intense confrontation / climax, delivering the horror in small doses until the final half hour
The hotel and the foreboding cellar - large echoes of "Psycho" here - are great settings
Most of all, the perverse plot involves incest and patricide, allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality
And yet it also becomes poignant as we realize Junior is no one-dimensionally evil bogeyman but as much a victim as the girls
<br /><br />"The Unseen" is a solid little horror flick worthy of discovery
"The Garden of Allah" is a prime example of "popular women's literature", turn of the XXth century style, combining all the power of unbridled erotic and exotic reveries with the stimulating glamour of fake mysticism and the sado-masochistic bite of Catholic guilt
Just as Jane Eyre couldn't really be happy until her castle burned down around her and her lover was permanently maimed for his sins, or the heroine of "Rebecca" couldn't find true fulfillment in her marriage until her lordly husband was put on trial for the murder of his first wife (and her castle burned down around her), or poor Psyche couldn't leave well enough alone and had to extract Cupid's secret at all costs, Domini, the devout Catholic heroine of this piece of tripe, can only find true sexual realization by inadvertently marrying a man who has renounced his sacred religious vows
Like all such narratives aiming to stimulate the female reader and induce the vapours, this one relies on the oldest tricks in the book: basic misunderstandings and the inability to express one's true feelings at the right place and at the right time until it is too late
The logic is that any ultimate sexual ecstasy can be indulged in as long as one is willing to eventually pay a high enough price for it in atonement in the last act
It is Paul Claudel reduced to beauty salon magazine standards
It could have been much worse and it often was
<br /><br />Without the religious overtones, the film's plot is that of your basic porn flick: Oversexed monk driven mad by abstinence escapes to the desert where he has a few rolls in the dunes with a romantic, shapely but naive Catholic heiress before reintegrating his monastery, all passion spent, leaving her to clean up his mess
And I really resent another commentator's comparison with Anatole France's "Thais", a sophisticated novel whose intention was to make fun of the whole concept of Catholic sexual repression, some of which transpired in Massenet's opera of the same name, thankfully
<br /><br />But what makes this picture unique in the annals of commercial female eroticism, of course, is the enormous constellation of talents gathered under one banner to make this cinematic wet dream come to shimmering, vibrant life
Imperishable Technicolor photography that will outlive us all, a truckload of worthy character actors (including one cute dog), a music score by Max Steiner that seems determined to accomplish the "composed film" that Michael Powell (who, ironically, had a bit part in the 1927 silent version) always dreamed about, tittering at times on the brink of dissonance but always coming through in splendid symphonic, operatic exoticism, a dream-like atmosphere where material considerations are no object, characters travel as if by magic from one spot to the next, dialog is sparse, vague and suggestive, the art direction is close to celestial, flower arrangements appear in the humblest hut or tent, the heroine's wardrobe is inexhaustible and all the male characters are either aristocrats, saints, doomed but horny sinners, mystics or poets
Hollywood! The MGM DVD presentation of this film is bare bones but impeccable
The bit rate is very high throughout, the colour registration is almost always perfect and the 2
0 mono sound truly does justice to Max Steiner's score and to Boyer's penultimate confession
<br /><br />A historical note on this sort of "women's subject": The following year (1937), Julien Duvivier, visibly inspired by "The Garden of Allah", directed "Carnet de Bal", where a very similar clothes-horse butter-won't-melt-in-her-mouth heroine (widowed after taking care of an ailing husband in the exotic remoteness of some impossibly romantic Alpine lakeside villa) wants to discover what she has missed by looking up the male dancers in her first dance book
She finds them all in time, only to realize that whatever feeling there was at one point between her beaus and herself were either misunderstood, overestimated or else had lifelong tragic consequences
It was Duvivier's cynical way of telling us to beware of impossibly idealistic notions and that we all need to grow up sooner or later
Will Smith delivers yet again in a film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to right his wrongs in a way that will touch even the most hardened of hearts!!! Writer Grant Nieporte and Italian Director Gabriele Muccino come together and created a masterpiece that I highly recommend to purchase and keep in your movie collection as you will never grow tired of watching/feeling this film!!! I have the Highest Respects for Will Smith as he is not only a brilliant Actor but one can tell he has a genuine love for people and life which no doubt made him perfect for the character (IRS Agent Ben Thomas) he played in this film
You will find yourself feeling his pain and anger, the frustrations over his love for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, who by the way was Fantastic as usual
I found myself falling in love with the fact their characters were falling in love
Woody Harrelson also stars in this Top Notch film
I find it very difficult to write this review without giving away key plot points
All I can say is, Watch it and when you do make sure you have nothing to interrupt you, take the phone off the hook, sit back and get ready to start trying to unravel the mysterious life and past of IRS Agent Ben Thomas
I thank you Will Smith for another Great Film!!
-A very pretty red headed woman waiting for her plane meets a charming young man that she connects with
As the two get on their flight and sit next to each other the young man Jack becomes deadly as he threatens Lisa to either change the room that a politician and his wife will be staying in, or else have her father die
See now that's what you happens when you fly coach, stuff like that never happens in first class
<br /><br />-Other than having a conflict that takes place on a flight, the other thing that this movie shares with "Flightplan" is the sheer unbelievability *if that's a word* of the story
The point of the whole is to get the main character to change a politician's room so he can be assassinated which is a pretty plausible plan, but won't it have being easier for Jack to just find someone that was computer savvy and have them hack into the hotel's system? Teenagers today can damn near do anything with computers, so I'm pretty sure it would have been easier for him to simply get someone to change it using a computer instead of going through the trouble of spying on Lisa and getting her into the predicament that she lands on in the movie
<br /><br />-Plus one thing that struck me as odd was how no one on the plan heard a single thing they were talking about
This is a very small plane were talking about here and since their voices were raised occasionally it seems to me like the other passengers should have heard something
But I'm 100% sure that I'm reading way too much into it
The movie is meant to be as realistic as an episode of "24" so one can't be perplexed by such complexities
For all my complaints though, this is still a very fun movie that gets the job done
It's not exactly the type that requires to shut of your brain, but at the same time it doesn't require great intelligence to fully enjoy
<br /><br />-I'd love to sit here in my comfy chair and rave about the brilliant acting in the movie but really I can't
I love Rachel McAdams, I love Cillian Murphy, and I like Brian Cox, but they don't really stretch their acting muscles here
It's not really much of a problem since this isn't the movie that studios hope to win multiple awards and the acting isn't the least bit horrible, just not great
Wes Craven isn't exactly the first that comes to mind when you think of a movie like this, but he does a very nice job considering the time they had to film the movie and the lack of depth to the script
It was definitely a huge improvement over the disappointing "Cursed" and as much as I liked him doing something different with this movie, I still would love for him to go back to doing what he did in the past which is great horror movies that is talked about decades after it's release
<br /><br />-One nice thing about the movie which I really appreciated was just how short the movie was
It is great to sit and watch a nice three hour or so movie once in a while, but nowadays it's like every movie that comes out feels too long, where as this movie just felt like the right length
They don't waste time by trying to develop the characters too much because they know this isn't the movie for that and by doing so they made a very nice short movie
Being a huge film music geek, I have to say that the best part of the movie is the ultra cool score by Marco Beltrami
It's really nice to see Beltrami go from writing the predictable stuff to the great music he's doing now
I really the cool techno/orchestral stuff he does for the main titles
Too bad that I can't find the soundtrack anywhere, would have really loved to listen to the titles anytime I wanted instead of having to pop in the DVD when I want to hear it
<br /><br />-Overall It's nice for what it is and whiles it's far from great cinema, should still provide for some small entertaining hour and a hal
I'd watch it again if it were rebroadcast, but the signal is passing Pluto as I write this
I am just glad I didn't live in THAT neighborhood
If they remade it I bet it would be very violent and bloody
So what are they waiting for? An excellent movie for pre-pubescent suburban boys
The shot with the St Bernard was the best and obviously the most haunting image from the film
and then they left the carcass on the stoop
Don't listen to the many acerbic and derisory comments heaped upon this film
simply put, as regards ninja movies, this my friends is about as good as it gets! <br /><br />Yes it's silly, yes the acting and script are admittedly absolutely atrocious, but by gum - it's so much bloody fun! In fact, as is often the case with B-Movies, the horrendous 'acting' (which in the case of the movie in question, is truly amongst the worst I have ever had the joy to behold!) and ridiculous 'plot' actually only serve to elevate the enjoyment level ten fold
<br /><br />Obviously the fight scenes are the main attraction in this though and for the most part I'm pleased to say, they're very well choreographed, especially the final showdown (during which we witness that ninja are not ostensibly constrained by the normal laws of gravity
) <br /><br />Trust me on this, if you are a fan of ninja movies and you have not yet seen Sakura Killers, then you are truly missing out on what is in my opinion, one of the true jewels in the crown of the genre
A somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era
Obviously, It was first conceived into this world for the stage, but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end
Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively
There is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it
All in all, though, A good film in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to overact
Legendary movie producer Walt Disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen
They remain among the most popular animated films of all time
The first was his groundbreaking classic "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" released in 1937
The last was the then-under appreciated "Sleeping Beauty" which made it's debut in 1959
In between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale: "Cinderella" (1950)
Of the three films, "Cinderella" is the one most faithful to its origins
Ironically, unlike "Snow White", which for better or worse, became for many the definitive version of the story
"Cinderella" did not follow the same path
Although it was a hit and, like "Snow White", was responsible for restoring the dwindling Disney fortunes, it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved
Disney, for once, did himself proud, electing not to tamper with a classic, instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale, rather than rewriting it for the screen
<br /><br />A combination of superb animation (in beautifully soft Technicolor) and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day
Ilene Woods, who was a radio performer, recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material, Al Hoffman, Mack David, and Jerry Livingston
When Disney heard them, he knew he had found his Cinderella
Woods heartfelt renditions of "A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes", "So This Is Love" and "Oh Sing Sweet Nightingale" are perfect
Eleanor Audley, who would go on to voice Maleficent in "Sleeping Beauty", masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother, while Rhoda Williams and Lucille Bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters
Luis Van Rooten admirably performed as both the King and the Grand Duke, and James Macdonald was endearing as both Jaq and Gus, Cinderella's devoted mice
William Phipps has little dialog as the prince (future talk show host Mike Douglas provided his singing voice) but film (and Disney) veteran, Verna Felton was born to play the fairy godmother, and she made the best number, (the Oscar-nominated "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo") her own show-stopper
<br /><br />Among the artists responsible for the "look" of the film, was Mary Blair, whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by Disney
Her elegant French-period backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie
But, most important of all' are the believable characters--from Cinderella, right down to Lucifer, the stepmother's deliciously evil cat
They bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story, something very difficult to create in an animated film
<br /><br />In conjunction with the film's 55-year anniversary, (and, not so coincidentally, the coming holiday season) "Cinderella" has just been released on a special edition DVD
The fully restored film must be seen to be appreciated--suffice it to say, it looks wonderful
An enhanced stereo soundtrack has been added, and serves the music well
The DVD extras, now a standard part of Disney Platinum Editions, are too numerous to list here, but as usual, some are directed towards children, some are slanted to adults, and the rest fall somewhere in between
But real fans will want to get the Deluxe Gift Set, because, along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches, it includes a 160-page hardback book, which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the 1995 special edition home video release, but much more as well
As usual for Disney, "Cinderella" will only be available for a limited time
So, if like me, you are a "Cinderella" lover, get it NOW! This edition is truly a "Dream Come True
I have complained to ABC about the cancellation of six degrees
If enough people do the same then it could be enough to bring this fabulous show back to life!! Just go onto the official site and the rest is simple enough
I do not understand why this show has been cancelled
What a fantastic show, cast and characters
The whole concept is gripping viewing! I am astounded that my favourite show is over after just one series
Why is this? Six degrees is phenomenal, it's better than so many other TV programmes out there! Until I heard they were stopping it from a friend it hadn't even occurred to me that this might happen
What an absolutely stunning movie, if you have 2
5 hrs to kill, watch it, you won't regret it, it's too much fun! Rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn't anything more other than him, I still liked it
Rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times, you really start liking it
Kalifornia came out in 1993, just as 3 of the 4 lead characters were up and coming to the levels of fame they now possess in 2006
This is a nice psycho-thriller that should appeal to all David Duchovny fans because of his dry and intelligent narratives that find their ways into his work, like with most of his episodes of the X-Files, Playing God, and Red Shoe Diaries
<br /><br />People who were put off by the heavy southern accent from Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis' characters obviously have never spent much time in the south
For every "Brian and Carrie" in the south, there is an "Adele and Early" and in 2006, that's the real horror of this flick
<br /><br />Aside from that, I think the film was written with a cult film intention - like with Carrie's photography, it's not suitable for mass consumption
But if you have a copy of this in your personal library, I think it says something positive about your tastes for freaky movies
The Ancient Mariner is a truly classic piece of work, as the original poem was/is
The context/setting with the old mariner himself is fine, clear, and without pretense
The artistic work that accompanies the reading of the poem fits perfectly the time/period of the setting and of the work itself, carrying the audience into the period with a still, yet moving accompaniment, using excellent still-movement strategies only well conquered by the pre-MTV era producers and much less apparent in more current works
(MTV brought to television and video a static movement that races through, often irrelevant cuts, from theme to theme without forward movement and without clear relationships to theme or storyline
) The voice, intonation and vitality of Redgrave's reading brings this touching poem to life with all its fear, strife and pain
In addition, the smooth movement of the video emphasizes the cadence and occasional monotone (in this case a positive mood under the theme of the story itself)of the author's rendition of the ancient mariner's sad and spooky tale
This is a must for any love of classic poetry, the sea, a tall tale, that almost rings true, and a story that has left a lasting impact on our world and culture
Who does not understand the meaning of an "albatross"? or the concept of "water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink?" A truly fine experience
DaSilva for bringing this to life for us, never to be forgotten
Fritz Lang's German medieval saga continues in Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (1924)
Kriemhild (Margarete Schoen) wants to avenge her murdered husband, Siegfried
Her brother is too weak to bring the murdered, Hagen, to justice
Kriemhild marries Etzel, the King of the Huns (Rudolf Klein-Rogge)
She gives birth to a child, and invites her brothers for a party
Etzel and the other Huns should kil Hagen, but he is protected by his brothers
We see a huge battle of life and death begins, and she sets the whole place on fire
Eventually Hagen is dead, and so is Kriemhild
These movies deal with great themes, such as revenge and undying love
Sure we have later seen some better movies made of those topics, but this was one of the early ones
There is an old saying that relates to the rousing new film by Joe Johnston that goes something like this: "The man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can't are both right
" That is a highly presumptuous statement referring to self motivating and belief in an individual, which, in this movie, stand true even after road blocks and family trouble stand in the way
<br /><br />"October Sky" is about a young man who believes in himself named Homer Hickam, growing up in a strict, traditional family in the 1950's
Homer loves in a small coal mining town where nearly every man grows up to be a miner
All of his friends, Quentin, Roy, and O'Dell all think that their life after high school will be like everyone else's
<br /><br />One night, while everyone stares at the sky, a Russian space craft called Sputnik passes overhead
This is something new for Homer, and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming
From this point on, his look at life will never be the same
<br /><br />First, he tells everyone that he wants to work in the rocket scientist area for an occupation
Flabbergasted at what he says, his family passes that idea over their heads and continues with life as usual His friends, however, think that this idea may have some potential
After all, Quentin is a very smart individual when it comes to this kind of thing
<br /><br />When the four friends start to test model rockets, and blow a white picket fence to smithereens, then what seems to be a forest fire is scared by them, they're forced to end their progresses
<br /><br />The performances in this movie are absolutely riveting from start to finish
All of the actors give performances as if this is the real mumbo jumbo here
Standing out in all of the glory: Laura Dern as Miss Riley
This very well may be Academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released
<br /><br />The characters are also extremely well developed
Not only to the filmmakers give clear, apparent reason why Homer is interested in the subject, but they also explain to the audience how they are succeeding in their studding of rocketry
We clearly understand all of the characters' motives and beliefs, especially the father, who is bent over on everlasting tradition
<br /><br />The film, unfortunately, loses some of its momentum at mid-point because of a silly, recycled romantic sub-plot involving Homer's love interest and how his brother stole her from him
This type of this is becoming so awfully common in high-school movies, not that this film is aimed at high-schoolers
The actors stare at each other mindlessly, like the are in a trance
I put up with it without complaining in 1997's "Inventing the Abbots," but I have had just about enough this
<br /><br />But that is just a minor complaint
With an authentic looking time period, cinematography worth an Oscar and clips of the real life Homer and friends at the end, whom all hit it big with their dreams, especially Homer, this is the first great film of 1999
I would not hesitate to put this adaptation of 'Death Trap" in a top 5 list of the best stage-to-movie adaptations ever
Caine and Reeves (an underrated actor who never really got a chance to do more than soggy romances and "Superman") play off each other extremely well here
Even Dyan Cannon - who I normally don't care for - is perfectly cast in a role that exploits her annoyance value as an actress
<br /><br />I'm not sure that comparisons of "Deathtrap" with "Sleuth" - another brilliant stage-to-screen adaptation featuring Michael Caine - are valid, or even fair
Yes, the two stories have a lot in common
But "Sleuth" is as much about class warfare as the battle of wits, and the house in "Sleuth" is set is at least as much a character in the movie as the two actors - the house doesn't really have an equivalent in "Deathtrap"
And "Deathtrap" isn't so much a battle of wits as it is a pointed vignette about how people are no damned good (and never as smart as they think they are) and deserve everything they get
I'll just say that both movies are superb examples of the genre, and well worth your time and money
You don't have to choose! <br /><br />I won't give away the twists and turns of the plot, but I don't think it matters anyway
I've watched the DVD eight or nine times in a dozen years, and still enjoyed the chemistry and the timing and the mean, scary moments when things go "all pear shaped"
It's all done so well that the ride becomes more important than the actual destination
<br /><br />Anyone who likes black-hearted comedy and suspense in the Hitchcock style of film-making will probably enjoy "Deathtrap" immensely
The Five Deadly Venoms is a great kung-fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery
There are all the usual telltale signs of a kung-fu flick: great choreography, awful dubbing, different "styles" of fighting, and a wide range of greatly exaggerated, often cheesey human emotions
However the plot certainly is better than average
It's interesting and holds your attention throughout the non-fight scenes
Occasionally it's even able to fire up the audience, such as when X character receives horrible injustice
<br /><br />Another thing I love about the Five Deadly Venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movie's morals and themes
Just about everyone gets what's coming to them
The cowardly, greedy, and corrupt lose out
The bad guys, consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own treachery and backstabbing
The good guys use teamwork, planning, and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top
The animation was well done and the romance was cute
I liked most of Bryan Adams' songs and the Hans Zimmer score was excellent
What a lot of people don't realize is how well it relates to the Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now themes (what happens when so-called "civilization" invades someone elses home, what does it mean to be "civilized" etc
The opening scenery and music were very stirring
The film is a lament to an America that was once beautiful
This little-appreciated movie is one of my favorites
Dreyfus and Braga are masterful, but Raul Julia steals the show! A tongue-in-cheek, menacingly humorous Gomez Addams, with just the right tone for this irreverent spoof of this oft-told story
<br /><br />Generally untrumpeted and unappreciated, Moon Over Parador allows you to check out of reality and join the fun going on up on the screen
I saw this movie the day it came out last year
Well, now it's on video and I saw it again
I love this movie! The things they do are sometimes dumb but that's what makes it my third favorite movie of all time
The special effects are okay, but the witty dialog will have you rolling
I'm the kind of person that'll say i'm inspired by this movie, so if you like dramas and other stuff, avoid
But for all others, enjoy! The acting is superb
Hank Azaria is hands down the best (he's neither a commie, nor a fruit) followed by Ben Stiller (uh, don't correct me
Macy delivering his best performance (outshining fargo) Everybody has praised everyone from macy to garafalo, but I think Kel Mitchell was pretty good as Invisible Boy
Two problems: The most boring part of the film is the subplot of the romance between Stiller and Claire Forlani, and the Casanova parole hearing
Some scenes absolutely advance the story in no way, but they're a blast
Kinka and especially the writers tend to drag on a scene untill all it's hilarity is gone, but bam they switch and you're ready for more
I swear after seeing this, you will be tired from the explosive climax (which I think was pretty cool) The camera is pretty cool also, moving at a furious pace with the actors
Also, Tom Waits delivers an outstanding performance (he has this kinda cool bad hero coolness to him) and like someone else said, the best parts are when the characters show some humanness to them
Captain Amazing is pretty funny, (especially his speech to Casanova about his perfect plan-I was rolling) and rush is pretty cool as Casanova
One beef: the funniest comedian ever (eddie izzard) is almost wasted, but his heart is in the right place
I give it twenty stars and hope that someday, everyone will see the brilliance in the film's best parody, the Six Million Dollar Man one
I have seen several Gene Kelly flicks and this is one of his best
I would actually put it above his more famous American in Paris
Sometimes it seems the story gets lost in Gene Kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers, but not in this movie
An unusual take on time travel: instead of traveling to Earth's past, the main trio get stuck in the past history of another planet
They beam down to this planet, whose sun is scheduled to go nova in 3 or 4 hours (that's cutting it close!)
In some kind of futuristic library, they meet Mr
Atoz (A to Z, get it? ha-ha) and his duplicates
It turns out, instead of escaping their planet's destruction via space travel, the usual way, the inhabitants have all escaped into their planet's various past time eras
Atoz uses a time machine to send people on their way after they make a selection (check out the discs we see here, another Trek prognostication of CDs and DVDs!)
Atoz prepares the machine (the Atavachron-what-sis), gallant Kirk hears a woman's scream and runs into the planet's version of Earth's 17th century, where he gets into a sword fight and is arrested for witchery
There's an eccentric but good performance here by the actress playing a female of ill repute in this time, using phrasing of the time ("
Spock & McCoy follow Kirk, but end up in an ice age, 5000 years earlier
<br /><br />Kirk manages to get back to the library first
The real story here is Spock's reversion to the barbaric tendencies of his ancestors, the warlike Vulcans of 5000 years ago
This doesn't really make sense, except that maybe this time machine is responsible for the change (even so, Spock & McCoy weren't 'prepared' by Atoz - oh, well; it also seems to me Spock was affected by the transition almost immediately - he mentions being from 'millions of light years' away, instead of the correct hundreds or thousands - a gross error for a logical Vulcan)
In any case, Spock really shows his nasty side here - forget "Day of the Dove" and remember "This Side of Paradise" - McCoy quickly finds out that his Vulcan buddy will not stand for any of his usual baiting and nearly gets his face rearranged
Spock also gets it on with Zarabeth, a comely female who had been exiled to this cold past as punishment (a couple of Trek novels were written about Spock's son, the result of this union)
All these scenes are eye-openers, a reminder of just how much Spock conceals or holds in
It's also ironic that, only a few episodes earlier ("Requiem for Methuselah"), McCoy was pointing out to Spock how he would never know the pain of love - and now all this happens
Kirk, meanwhile, tussles with the elderly Atoz, who insists that Kirk head back to some past era ("You are evidently a suicidal maniac" - great stuff from actor Wolfe, last seen in "Bread and Circuses")
It all works out in the end, but, like I mentioned earlier, they cut it very close
A neat little Trek adventure, with a definite cosmic slant
Like the characters in this show, I too was a teen during the 70s
The producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist, of being a suburban teenager in the 70s
The 70s fashions, cars, home furnishings, foods, and fads, are all very authentic in this show
<br /><br />The show boasts a very talented ensemble cast, who all mesh together very well on camera
I really like the unique, psychedelic-style film sequences
No other show does camera tricks like this
These cutting-edge film sequences, really help to convey the campy hipness, that characterized the 70s era
<br /><br />Overall this is a very funny sitcom
The one thing that bothers me about this show, is it's over-reliance on cruel humor, to generate laughs
In this way, I think that this show tries to be too much like Married With Children
While Married with Children is a great sitcom in its own right, it's tacky that the creators of That 70s show, keep trying to imitate it
<br /><br />I do recommend That 70s Show, mainly due to it's nostalgia factor
It could be an even better show though, if the writers relied more on witty dialog, rather than bawdy, tasteless jokes and pranks
A hilarious Neil Simon comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end
The late Walter Matthau is the grouchy ex-comedian who is persuaded to join together with his ex-partner (the late Oscar-winner George Burns) for a final reunion show on stage
<br /><br />Benjamin Martin is Matthau's agent and nephew, and the two have just as much chemistry as Matthau and Burns
I love Matthau's grumpy character--he's just the same as he always is, and yet also very different
<br /><br />Burns, as the absent-minded old man, is just as funny as Matthau
<br /><br />Matthau: Want some crackers? I've got coconut, pineapple and graham
<br /><br />Burns: How about a plain cracker?<br /><br />Matthau: I don't got plain
<br /><br />Burns: Okay<br /><br />Matthau: They're in the cupboard in the kitchen
<br /><br />Or how about this:<br /><br />Matthau: When I did black, the whites knew what I was saying!<br /><br />You've got to see it in the movie to understand it!<br /><br />All in all, a refreshingly hilarious, sweet, heartfelt, warm, belivable character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time
<br /><br />They just don't make them like this anymore! In a time when all the newest comedies are crude, juvenile and stupid, this leans back towards the tender core of what comedy really is--funny characters, smart and funny dialogue, and grand entertainment
<br /><br />One of the best buddy comedies of all time, right up there with "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," "Lethal Weapon," and "The Hard Way
"<br /><br />You may have a hard time finding this for rent or on TV, but trust me, it will be worth your time!<br /><br />4
These guys are anything but the Usual Suspects! They are a total bunch of likeable oddballs who you want to see get away with it,but they are so hapless that there is very little chance of that
No one is better than William H Macy at portraying the man with a big heart but down on his luck
This is probably his best performance since Fargo
Sam Rockwell played the meathead boxer to perfection,and the rest of the gang were uniformly good also
Luis Guzman brought some great comic relief as Cosimo,and George Clooney stole every scene in his cameo role
The heist scene at the end was absolutely hilarious
<br /><br />The direction was also spot on by the Russo brothers
There was certainly a Coen brothers feel to the film throughout and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their careers
They have a long way to go to match the Coen's but this is an excellent start and I look forward to their next celluloid outing
Kudos to the writers of this film for creating a supremely engaging drama
The curious character development is indicative of a nuanced and well schooled writing team
The audience member cannot but help but to feel that (s)he must make wrenching emotional decisions pitting the cerebral against the libidinal
The viewer has an opportunity to develop the character herself, though her predictions are rarely validated
<br /><br />Credit is also due to the filmmakers for breathing life into the setting
The wood-shop is transformed into a unique persona as the film unfolds, with its own traits, faults, a variety of highly charged relationships, and of course a fate inexorably tied to that of the other principals
<br /><br />Make sure to catch this one at your local art-house
If you haven't seen this obscure little charmer, you should seek it out
It is the story of a bumbling, wartime Sad Sack (Fred MacMurray) who is listed 4-F each time he attempts to join any branch of the military
He finds a magic lamp which of course contains a genie (Gene Sheldon), but the genie is even more bumbling than MacMurray is, sending him across time to serve in all the wrong times and places than the one he wants
It is cute, cheerful, and pure fluff, and you can't help but like it
The plots is much like a Disney film, particularly since the two stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) both made numerous Disney films in the 50's and 60's, although not together
Needless to say, it all ends well for everyone, and the viewer goes away feeling pretty good
During 1933 this film had many cuts taken from it because it was very over the top for the story content and the fact that Lily Powers,(Barbara Stanwyck) would do anything to obtain great wealth and power
Lily's father had forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14 and she grew up in a steel mill of a town with very poor people and her father ran a speakeasy which brought into his home all kinds of male characters who had their eye on Lily
As the story progresses, Lily meets up with man after man and eventually finds a guy who has everything and is a playboy bank president It is great to see a very young John Wayne, (Jimmy McCoy Jr
) who was only 25 when this picture was produced and Jimmy did not even get to first base with Lily, not even for lunch
A very young George Brent, (Coutland Trenholm) stars along with Barbara Stanwyck and both gave outstanding performances
This is a great film from 1933 which was produced by Darryl F
Zanuck and was locked up in a fault for many years and just recently is being shown on the silver screen
This film is rather mild compared to what we view on the Hollywood screens today, but in 1933 it was very naughty to watch this type of film
Cuban Blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way
I actually watched it while sailing around Cuba on a western Caribbean cruise
It details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution
Not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end, when the Socialist regime came and took the property of the boy's father
The majority of the film is the boy's coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else
There are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to
A class A film with fine acting and directing
This is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists
It is a film about people and their lives, their mistakes, and their triumphs
A good film worth watching several times annually
It succeeded in doing something that few movies do now; it provided family values while entertaining me
Nancy Drew is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls to look up to
The little girls I was with throughly enjoyed the movie and kept talking about Nancy as we walked out of the theater
The movie has relatively few problems for families and I don't think parents will get bored sitting in the theater
No, it won't win an Oscar and it did not showcase magnificent special effects or even provide a horribly spooky mystery, but it entertained me and it stood true to the the spirit of the books
I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody with a young girl (she will love it!) or any fan of the books
i actually liked it better than the 1st one
it seemed like it was shot documentary style
at first this bothered me,as i thought it just looked too low budget
but it grew on me,and it made the movie seem more authentic
this movie has more dry one liners than the original,which is a good thing,in my opinion
i do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the characters
it almost becomes a parody of itself,which may be the point
this movie at least has some suspense,which the 1st one did not have,in my view
it has some of the same great music from the original,which is great
the acting again was pretty decent for the most part,though like i said,some of it seemed over the top
i also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are a few minutes which seem really slow and just don't seem to flow,like the rest of the movie
overall,though,i thought this was a pretty sequel
my rating for "Return to Cabin by the Lake" is 7/10
A strangely enjoyable effort, combining an appropriately far-fetched plot involving Adam and Burt and flashbacks to the original TV series
Most of the flashback scenes were lifted directly from Burt Ward's book "Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights" and I imagine his book was the inspiration for making this movie
Like the book, it left fans of the original series hungering for more
<br /><br /> If you missed this broadcast, it is definitely worth the effort to borrow a tape from a friend who may have recorded it
There is certainly emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship--one based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning
And there is also emotion in the inner-workings of Mathieu's family dealing w/ his mother's problems--and how that comes to bear on their relationship
But the problem is it leaves a lot of things unanswered (unless I'm just too dumb to pick up on them)
Why is Mathieu in a mental hospital? What led to the boys' break-up? And the flashing back between present and past is a little hard to follow at first
It seems like the main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some homoerotic vicarious thrills, or some male nudity
But as a love story or character study it is lacking and unsatisfying
Halfway through Lajos Koltai's "Evening," a woman on her deathbed asks a figure appearing in her hallucination: "Can you tell me where my life went?" The line could be embarrassingly theatrical, but the woman speaking it is Vanessa Redgrave, delivering it with utter simplicity, and the question tears your heart out
<br /><br />Time and again, the film based on Susan Minot's novel skirts sentimentality and ordinariness, it holds attention, offers admirable performances, and engenders emotional involvement as few recent movies have
With only six months of the year gone, there are now two memorable, meaningful, worthwhile films in theaters, the other, of course, being Sara Polley's "Away from Her
" Hollywood might have turned "Evening" into a slick celebrity vehicle with its two pairs of real-life mothers and daughters - Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson, and Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer
Richardson is Redgrave's daughter in the film (with a sister played by Tony Collette), and Gummer plays Streep's younger self, while Redgrave's youthful incarnation is Claire Danes
<br /><br />Add Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson, and a large cast - yes, it could have turned into a multiple star platform
Instead, Koltai - the brilliant Hungarian cinematographer of "Mephisto," and director of "Fateless" - created a subtle ensemble work with a "Continental feel," the story taking place in a high-society Newport environment, in the days leading up to a wedding that is fraught with trouble
<br /><br />Missed connections, wrong choices, and dutiful compliance with social and family pressures present quite a soap opera, but the quality of the writing, Koltai's direction, and selfless acting raise "Evening" way above that level, into the the rarified air of English, French (and a few American) family sagas from a century before its contemporary setting
<br /><br />Complex relationships between mothers and daughters, between friends and lovers, with the addition of a difficult triangle all come across clearly, understandably, captivatingly
Individual tunes are woven into a symphony
<br /><br />And yet, with the all the foregoing emphasis on ensemble and selfless performances, the stars of "Evening" still shine through, Redgrave, Richardson, Gummer (an exciting new discovery, looking vaguely like her mother, but a very different actress), Danes carrying most of the load - until Streep shows up in the final moments and, of course, steals the show
Dancy and Wilson are well worth the price of admission too
<br /><br />As with "Away from Her," "Evening" stays with you at length, inviting a re-thinking its story and characters, and re-experiencing the emotions it raises
At two hours, the film runs a bit long, but the way it stays with you thereafter is welcome among the many movies that go cold long before your popcorn
Looking for Quo Vadis at my local video store, I found this 1985 version that looked interesting
Wow! It was amazing! Very much a Ken Russell kind of film -quirky, stylized, very artistic, and of course "different
" Nero was presented not so much as evil incarnate, but as a wacky, unfulfilled emperor who would rather have had a circus career
He probably wondered why on earth he was put in the position of "leading" an empire -it wasn't much fun, and fun is what he longed for
Klause Maria Bandaur had a tremendous time with this role and played it for all it was worth
Yes, Nero persecuted the Christians with a vengeance; one of many who did so
At one point one of his henchmen murmurs: "No one will ever understand we were simply protecting ourselves
The opening credits make for a brilliant, atmospheric piece of escapist entertainment that's full of little nods to the comic strip
All the good guys are good, all the bad guys are bad, and the film is jam-packed with familiar character actors covered in gruesom make-up to hi-lite their characteristics
<br /><br />Warren Beatty, as Dick Tracy, is the ultimate tough guy straight man, incorruptable, calm usually, always a better fighter than the other guy, and rarely one to push the limit on legality
Al Pacino, as "Big Boy" Caprice steals every scene he's in as a hunch-backed gangster in some unnamed metropolis of 1930s gangsters
Maddonna plays the kind of person she'd probably play best, Breathless Mahoney, a nightclub singer and femme fatale with her own little agenda going
Gleanne Headly is Tracy's tough-talking, fiercely independent long-time girlfrined
And then there's The Kid, a funny little street urchin Tracy takes in, who models himself after his surrogate father, and saves Tracy when the detective has accepted his fate of being blown up
<br /><br />The supporting players are a Who's Who of character actors
Dick Van Dyke is the District Attorney, who's bribed by Big Boy's goons to keep him on the streets
Dustin Hoffman has a humorous turn as Mumbles, the snitch whose dialect is so indecipherable the cops can't make head nor tail of what he has to say
Armstrong is Pruneface, one of the rival gangsters Big Boy forms a special allegiance to in order to create a network of crime spreading throughout the whole city
Mandy Patinkin is 88 Keys, the piano player for Breathless's show
Paul Sorvino plays Lips Manlis, Breathless's former benefactor until Big Boy gives him "the Bath
" James Caan wears relatively little make-up in his performance as the only gangster who won't go along with Big Boy's grand plan
William Forsythe and Ed O'Ross are Big Boy's enforcers, Flattop and Itchy
<br /><br />This movie retains all of the corn of the comic strip, plus it is full of vibrant colors
Almost all the suits are elaborate in blues and greens and yellows and reds
All the colors of the rainbow are found in this movie--and then some! The matte paintings that are used truly realize this world as two-dimensional, only acted in three-dimensional sets
Al Pacino fills the shoes of his character like no other character he's played before or since
Big Boy is kind of crazy, and kind of self-pitying
He's an eccentric little man who takes pride in quoting our Founding Fathers and likening himself to great political leaders
The man with the plan, always looking for the smartest way to do business
This is an awesome action film with great one liners from Arnie!
It's stylishly made, with lots of tense action to keep one satisfied
The Characters were awesome, and Richard Dawson, is very menacing as the main villain
Yes it has tons of plot holes,however it's highly highly entertaining, with a great ending as well
It had a great story, too it, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had great chemistry together
The Character development was also pretty good, with, some superb performances
Paul Michael Glaser, does a very good job here, with awesome use of colors, keeping it stylish throughout, awesome camera angles, and overall keeping the film at a very fast pace! good job
We get a few bloody gunshot wounds, exploding head, slit throat, bloody chainsaw slices, skinless corpses, blood, and an impaling
Arnold Schwarzenegger is AMAZING as always, he is excellent in the acting department , has tons of hilarious one liners, kicks that ass, and as always is a big physical presence!, and was tons of fun to watch! (Arnie Rules!)
Maria Conchita Alonso, does well here, she was really cute, and had good chemistry with Arnie!
Yaphet Kotto, is decent here, with what he has to do, which is not much
McIntyre, is good as the geeky type guy, he was cool!
Richard Dawson is awesome as the main villain, and was very very menacing, and he was fun to watch
Jesse Ventura,Jim Brown,Erland van Lidth,Gus Rethwisch,and Professor Toru Tanaka, all do what they have to do very well as the stalkers
The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show worried me at first
The films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off
However, I was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this Comedy Central gem
I could possibly put her on par with the likes of Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy -- Sarah's character is a true sociopath, very comparable to Sedaris' Jerri Blank
<br /><br />The one downfall of this show is its supporting cast
Her sister's character is good; Funny at times, but ultimately meant not to steal Sarah's show
However, the rest of the cast is extremely sub-par in comparison
<br /><br />I'm glad, though, that Comedy Central has given Sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor
This is a so called 'feel-good' movies, however it made me sad in a way
Why? Because I had the talent, but my parents didn't let me study at the sports academy, as well the fact that at the age of 12 I decided to quit soccer
<br /><br />And soccer is the red line in this movie
Together with the struggle youngsters have with the expectations parents have
An English-Indian girl and her parents, with their traditions and strong family ties, and on the other hand the English family with a daugther who dresses like a boy, and plays soccer
a combination which worries her mother! This movie also lines out the lives of ordinary people, as well as the Indian community in England
It is about believe in your dreams, and live your one life (where did we hear that before)
<br /><br />Paraminder Nagra (a beautiful women!) plays Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, make-up and the typical 17 year old girl stuff
In contradiction with her sister Pinky, complete the opposite of Yasminda
<br /><br />A real must it is, to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of their parents, and finds her luck eventually
With great music from Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C, as well as Indian hit songs
<br /><br />Pleasant to watch, but if you, as myself, ever played soccer, and never made it to the top, then this movie will make you melachonic
Wow, this was another good spin off of the original American pie, not as good as band camp, but definitely a lot better the naked mile
Dwight and Erik stifler lead the comedy in this one, but I actually preferred the dialogue in this one to the naked mile
The script was written a lot better and the comedy flowed more smoothly, however most of the comedy came from sex, but that's okay because that's why we watch these movies anyway right? <br /><br />The midget Rock also had a really good cameo, considering the intense effort given by him in the naked mile, his scene with stifler was awesome and had me laughing my ass off when i saw it
<br /><br />The movie was a definite improvement in my opinion compared to the naked mile, if you liked any previous American Pie films, you should like beta house, unless you view all of the American pie spin-offs a waste of money
We saw this at one of the local art movie theaters in the Montrose area of Houston, TX
It was a total surprise compared to the write-up in the theater's newsletter but we were both blown away by the artistry
It was beautifully done and (apparently) photographed in a schloss (German name for château) somewhere in the Munich area
It is a very explicit exploration of the sexual relationships of a group of twentyish men and women isolated from the day-to-day constraints
It is fantastic on more levels than I can remember
We came home after the movie and talked and talked until about 4 am the next morning
<br /><br />The version we saw was in English (mostly) so there must be at least two versions since the first reviewer saw the movie in (probably its original) German version
I searched and searched for a video tape version but never came up with anything
Would absolutely love to have a VHS or DVD version of this
It explores relationships at a fundamental level and is also a great tutorial on how to relate to your partner
If anyone knows the writer/director, please convince him to release again, preferably on DVD these days
I cannot even imagine getting tired of watching the candid performance of the actors who are now probably all in their forties
I have seen Dirty Work several times and is probably my favourite Stan and Ollie short
<br /><br />In this one, Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps and get the job to clean the chimney at the home of Professor Noodle (Lucien Littlefield)
While Noodle is doing mad experiments in his lab, Stan and Ollie cause much chaos trying to clean the chimney and make a mess of the living room
The end is where Ollie falls into a tank of special formula that Noodle uses for his experiments and this turns him into a chimp! The best part is where Ollie falls down the chimney and loads of bricks land on his head, but he doesn't seem to suffer much pain from this
<br /><br />Dirty Work is Stan and Ollie at their funniest
Amongst the standard one liner type action films, where acting and logic are checked at the door, this movie is at the top of the class
If the person in charge of casting were to have put "good" actors in this flick, it would have been worse(excepting Richard Dawson who actually did act well, if you can call playing yourself "acting")
I love this movie! The Running Man is in all likelihood God's gift to man(okay maybe just men)
Definitely the most quotable movie of our time so I'll part you with my favorite line: "It's all part of life's rich pattern Brenda, and you better F*****g get used to it
" Ahh, more people have been called "Brenda" for the sake of quoting this film than I can possibly imagine
One of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers, an observation which mystifies me
Not only directed by the acclaimed Ang Lee,it had many young actors who were to become major stars, e
, Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson, and Jewel
All of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances, especially Meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing
<br /><br />When the biographies and accomplishments of the director ( even when he won an academy award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their past performances
I discovered the film on DVD by accident and it became one of my most often watched films
However, it is seldom every seen on cable
I look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known
Why does this have such a low rating? I really don't get it
Is it because of the bad acting? The bad dialogue? Well, who cares about these things in cheesy low-budget horror movies? Seriously, the acting and the dialogue isn't important in those movies
People who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldn't be allowed to rate cheesy low-budget movies
Those movies shouldn't be taken seriously
<br /><br />Anyway, time to talk about the movie, right? Well, I loved it! I bought it because I expected a gorefest, but it's not a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad (most of the time it's just animal guts placed on the body of the actors and that's lame), but I didn't really care because the movie is hilarious! The characters are hilarious, the acting is hilarious (bad acting is a GOOD thing in cheesy low-budget horror movies), the dialogue is hilarious (bad dialogue is a GOOD thing in cheesy low-budget horror movies), the zombie rapist with a huge dick is hilarious, the flying demon baby is hilarious and I could go on and on and on, but I don't want to say too much
BUT I have to mention that there's a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll like it's alive lol! Oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lol!<br /><br />Best lines in the movie:<br /><br />Detective Manners: *sniffs coke* Detective Sloane: What the *beep* are you doing, Manners? What the hell did you snort? What the hell is that? Detective Manners: It's nothing man, it's
<br /><br />Detective Manners: *injects heroin in his arm* Detective Sloane: What the *beep* are you doing, Manners? Are you *beep* insane? Detective Manners: It's cold medicine
<br /><br />Detective Manners: *repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face* Detective Sloane: What the hell's going on, Manners? What are you doing? Detective Manners: This maniac was rambling about demons and then he started smashing his head on the rock! He just started smashing his head on the rock! I think he's on PCP or something!<br /><br />LOL
I bellied up to the bar expecting this to be a hot beer on a sweltering Texas day but was pleasantly surprised
After suffering through "Saturday Night Foolishness" I had no desire to see a re-make in some south Texas barnyard
John Revolta was good as the jealous redneck, Scott Glenn was well cast as a thuggie ex-con, and Debra Winger was, as always, a delight
*Love that woman* Plus, the soundtrack was dynamite [and this comes from a guy that can't stand the sound of country music]
Along with "Brothers & Sisters", "Six Degrees" was one of my favorite new dramas of fall 2006
<br /><br />Great cast all around, but really enjoyed the work of Campbell Scott (the come-back photog) and Hope Davis (recent widow of journalist killed in Iraq)
<br /><br />Aside from the acting, the writing was fresh and the acting superb
The show was also shot in NYC, the real city, not the Warner Bros
or some other studio's backlot, adding a secondary layer or realism
<br /><br />I guess people are more interested in the latest "Survivor" and other reality garbage
At long last! One of Michael Jackson's most well known and beloved films comes to DVD! In Michael Jackson Moonwalker, (Michael Jackson) stars as Michael
A man with powers that are not of this world
Michael must save Sean (Sean Lennon), Katie (Kellie Parker), Zeke (Brandon Quintin Adams), and the rest of the worlds children from drug lord Frankie Lideo aka Mr
Big (Joe Pesci) who's mission in life is to get all of the worlds children hooked on drugs! A NOTE TO PEOPLE IN THE USA LOOKING FOR THIS FILM ON DVD: Make sure when buying this film on DVD you buy Warners Product #WK00817 as NTSC Region 3 which plays on North American NTSC Region 1 players
I read the negative comments before viewing this film and undeterred, went ahead and started watching
I admit that I had to rewind quite a few times as the film is incredibly complex, involved and full of detail
That is a good thing but also, quite unexpected in this culture of car chases, explosions, gratuitous sex and general violence that substitute for plot and character development
In fact, what a welcome departure, however, I am so used to not paying a lot of attention to what I watch
<br /><br />This film is chock full of character development and plot line; the kind that we used to analyze when I was in high school
It requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer
I would compare it to 'All The President's Men' in terms of generic subject matter
That is, it is a mystery about intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those with enough influence upon officials to essentially 'own' them
<br /><br />Unlike 'All The President's Men', this film makes an effort to give a couple of the characters actual personality
In this sense the movie is a character study like 'The Negotiatior' with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey
In that movie, their characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense
Yet, the plot is dependent on the ability of their characters to cooperate with each other, trust each, and ultimately unite together against the corrupt Police Department
There is more gun fire in this film and the specific plot is different but generically, there are many similarities
<br /><br />I WILL say that City Hall requires a whole lot more concentration
In fact, I was struck how parallel it was to past and present political scandals I've seen in my life going back to Watergate
The thing is, the public knows that something is wrong, for sure! but following the details is hard to do
This movie is not even close to being as complex as real life but it actually is realistic to life in its complexity
I think that is one of the reasons that previous posters have criticized the film: unrealistic expectations
<br /><br />If one watches this knowing what they are about to see and are up to the experience, it really is excellent! I watched it 3 times in a row! The acting is superb and the directing is flawless
Soldier isn't a great movie, and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons
But I liked Soldier alot, partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me
<br /><br />First, the art direction is tight and well executed
As far as science fiction backdrops go, Soldier was doing things with more design then 90% the genre
The sets, costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed; I didn't love all of their future military style, but I was impressed with the effort
For me, this made the movie worth the time it took to watch
<br /><br />Second, I'm a Kurt Russell fan
I grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth
The Barefoot Executive and his John Carpenter films
Soldier is essentially an action movie, and the role of Sergeant Todd is an essential action hero
It's not an award winning role, but Kurt musters up convincing emotion with VERY little dialog
<br /><br />Third, the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed
This isn't iron monkey, or even the matrix, but once again, it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre
<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, and you like sci-fi action films, pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice
I just wanna say that amongst all the so-called classic hiphop films Ive seen like Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin', Style Wars etc
IMO BEAT STREET is the best amongst the others
Whenever I ask other people about which is their fave, then it seems that BEAT STREET pops out the most
3 is just a punch "under the belt" (If say, 5 points is the belt)
I love the music performances, the breakdancing makes me wanna spin, RAMO makes me wanna throw a piece
I saw the description of the movie on TCM and only let it run because I like both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, so I was delightfully surprised to find that I really liked the movie and found it quite exceptional
Of course, it is seriously dated, but as a period piece it is well worth watching just for the subtle humour in insight into life and lifestyle almost forty years ago
Now the only problem is trying to find it on DVD so I can watch it more often
I also was quite taken with the performances of Smith and Ustinov as the leads, and of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, and the cameo appearances by Robert Morley and Cesar Romero
This is a perfect series for family viewing
We gather around the TV to watch this on BBC America
It is an up-to-date version of Robin Hood and it appeals to children and adults alike
Our teenager and tween-ager both enjoy sitting with mom and dad and watching Robin's next exploits
We can't wait for the next episode to air each week and are glad for the free "On Demand" viewing
<br /><br />The wardrobe has a spot of current fashion
The violence is not over-the-top or needless
The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a John William's feel to it
It is an old world tale that is brought to life again with a new world flair
<br /><br />There is so much garbage on television from brain rotting "reality" TV to senseless violence
You should take this for what it is and that is an updated "Robin Hood" not to be compared with the movie exploits of Errol Flynn
Parents that are concerned about their children watching too much violence will enjoy that Robin has lost his taste for war and bloodshed
He is a Robin Hood that would rather attempt to reason his way out of a disagreement than fight
Maid Marian is also an appealing role model for young girls
Rather than stand by and do nothing, she takes her own role in helping the poor by being the "Night Watchman
" The Sheriff of Nottingham is deliciously over the top wicked, just as the Sheriff should be and looks like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry
Guy Gisborne is played by an extremely handsome actor, one that makes most women wish he didn't have portray the role of a bad "Guy"
<br /><br />The only question we have is "Where is Friar Tuck?
Another Downey must-see! If you are an obsessed fan like me, you have got to see this movie! He plays Alex Finch, a 22 year old Yale grad who realizes that the life he just came into is the life he left 26 years earlier
Alex is the re-incarnation of Louie Jeffries, a no-nonsense lawyer happily married to Corrine (Cybil Sheppard)
Louie is killed on their one-year anniversary when he is hit by a car
He demands to go back, only this time in the body of Alex Finch
, a lot of confusion, and a lot of laughs
<br /><br />Although this movie is 15-years old, it still makes you wonder if there really is such a thing as re-incarnation
And if so, how often to you meet the same souls life after life
But I do know that you need to see this movie
It is a riot, and Downey looks SO GOOD in a tuxedo
This film makes you believe in love, and true love never dies
Dog days is one of most accurate films i've ever seen describing life in modern cities
It's very harsh and cruel at some points and sadly it's very close to reality
Isolation, desperation, deep emotional dead ends, problematic affairs, perversion, complexes, madness
All the things that are present in the big advanced cities of today
It makes you realize once again the pityful state in which people have lead society
<br /><br />The negative side of life in the city was never pictured on screen so properly
La Teta y la Luna is a symbolic spain film
Everything that in this film occurs has a symbolic meaning
It is totally different to the usual movie that one has access
<br /><br />This film is good but it will be good only for the people who want look for the meaning of everything in the film's tale
I must advice that this is not a sample film
Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a solid hit rate as far as their TV work is concerned
However, their film work has been much more chequered (2008's The Bank Job was fine, the previous year's Across The Universe decidedly weak, for instance)
<br /><br />Still Crazy, fortunately, is a solid success
It has a great story, excellent performances, a lot of humour, fabulous music and, above everything else, real heart
<br /><br />I savour "moments", and this film has one of them - just when everything is going pear-shaped at the festival reunion performance
This series could very well be the best Britcom ever, and that is saying a great deal, considering the competitors (Fawlty Towers, Good Neighbours, to name just two)
<br /><br />What made Butterflies so superior, even to the best of the best, is that it did not just exemplify great, classic, classy and intelligent comedy, but it also expanded horizons, reflecting - flawlessly, gently, and at every detail - the great social change that was occurring in Britain at the time
<br /><br />I remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it
The lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself
This was the first time I saw real people using cordless phones
And the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in North America at the time
Then there were the decors, shop fronts, cars
These people - even the layabout sons, with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor - were sophisticated
They were examples of the "New Europeans" that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade (1980s)
<br /><br />Of course, the premise was strange and fantastic
The idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary, particularly to North Americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things (sure the situation was depicted in American movies and TV, but not with the intensity of Butterflies or the movie Montenegro)
And, if the premise was not surprising enough, the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme
A potential affair that was not really about sex, or even romance? Butterflies dazzled many, but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief
<br /><br />Butterflies turned out to be - in so many ways - prophetic
It documented, ahead of its time - post-modern ennui, all-pervasive lifestyle, the notion of emotional infidelity, and generational disconnect and male discontent (portrayed perfectly by the strained father-son relationships)
It is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way, and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place, and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come
This time, it revolves around Diana Gusman who is always getting into fights at school
Instead of getting expelled, she takes her anger elsewhere, to the boxing ring
She trains to be a boxer and there she meets featherweight Adrian and begins to fall in love with him
This movie has a powerful message of taking your dreams and going with them even if someone doesn't believe in you (in this case, her dad doesn't believe in her)
That alone makes the movie worth the price
I don't think anyone besides Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung makes cinema on a purer level than Claire Denis
That said, I don't love this, her newest film, quite as much as her 2001 masterpiece "Trouble Every Day" (although it comes very close), which itself is one of my absolute favorite films
It it only because the narrative here is possibly slightly too elliptical for it's own good
Don't get me wrong, the fact that this film barely has a plot at all is really one of the best things about it, but I think Denis took it about one degree farther than it needed to go and consequently the film does flirt with incomprehensibility, and a few key plot points should have been clarified somehow (like that the main character goes to South Korea to get his heart transplant, instead of just showing him there all of a sudden without any explanation of where he is or why he is there)
Also some of the other characters seemed unnecessary and as if they were just excuses for Denis to use actors she likes yet again (Beatrice Dalle's character in particular is a little distracting because you keep expecting that she is going to have some significance)
Still, the film is incredibly absorbing and the cinematography is beyond amazing
It is definitely very much a masterpiece in it's own way
At least as good as Denis' more highly-acclaimed "Beau travail", if not better
Claire Denis has to be my favorite French director at this point, better than Leos Carax even
Also I have to admit that the South Korean sequence really does do "Lost in Translation" better than that film itself does (and I, unlike some, am a huge fan of that film as well)
Two years ago I watched "The Matador" in cinema and I loved everything about this movie
Obviously, I was totally under impression of Pierce Brosan's magnificent role
Yesterday, I caught this movie again on TV so I looked at it a bit deeper
Now, I can say with certain that this movie isn't that special but you just gotta' love it because of one man
<br /><br />Brosnan lifts its grade up in my opinion with amazing performance of Julian Noble, tired hit-man who has no friends
Soon Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City, man who's got bad luck: his son died in accident, his job isn't going that well and he's not sure that he can keep his wife Bean (Hope Davis)
<br /><br />I always liked movies like this; crime movie with big touch of humor
Mostly that humor comes from Brosnan as he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d
or one of my favorite lines in this movie: "I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning, after the navy's left town
" Brosnan says it with his charm while he's drinking his margarita as usually
I also like Greg 'typical American face' Kinnear in the role of loser that is very lively made because there are plenty of people like Danny Wright
<br /><br />So I recommend you to watch quite possibly the best role of Brosnan ever
He'll make you smile and admire him at the same time
In the Citadel film series book The Films of Gene Kelly, Anchors Aweigh is described as a kingpin of a musical
It's such an important film in both the careers of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra
Kathryn Grayson didn't do too badly with this either
Mayer had lent Gene Kelly out to Columbia where Harry Cohn had an inspiration to let Kelly choreograph his own numbers and because of it, Cover Girl became a classic
So if Mayer didn't learn a lesson, producer Joe Pasternak did and allowed Kelly artistic control
When Anchors Aweigh was finished, Fred Astaire at last had a dancing rival for monarch of cinema dance
<br /><br />The main number everyone talks about with Gene Kelly here is the dance with Jerry Mouse
Originally Kelly wanted to do the number with Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, but Disney wasn't lending Mickey out to nobody
Mickey would have to wait until Who Framed Roger Rabbit to do an outside film
Not to worry because MGM had it's own animated rodent one half the team of Tom and Jerry
<br /><br />Kelly as dancer always strived to do something new and different on screen as did Fred Astaire
For the next dozen years, these two were allowed all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work even if the films themselves weren't up to snuff
It was like each inspired the other to bigger and better creativity, Kelly for MGM, Astaire for MGM and any number of other studios
In Anchors Aweigh, Kelly got Sinatra to dance a bit
In fact Frank Sinatra always gave credit to Gene Kelly for showing him how musicals should be done as he gave credit to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for their help in earning him is Oscar for From Here to Eternity
<br /><br />When Frank Sinatra had half of his contract bought from RKO by MGM he insisted on a little artistic creativity on his own
He'd become friends with the songwriting team of Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn
In his autobiography Sammy Cahn tells about how Sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film
Mayer gave in and the team wrote some really fine ballads for him to sing
One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh, I Fall in Love Too Easily
Frank sings it accompanying himself on the piano at an empty Hollywood Bowl
<br /><br />With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn richly earned the title of having put more song lyrics in Frank Sinatra's mouth than any other person
They were lifetime friends and Cahn always credited Sinatra with this milestone boost in his career
<br /><br />On a bet Styne and Cahn said they could write a song just using a chromatic scale
They proved it in Anchors Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson put her soprano to work on All of a Sudden My Heart Sings
<br /><br />Here singing in fact is the basis of the plot
Two sailors on leave through a combination of circumstances meet up with Kathryn Grayson and her orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell
Trying to fix her up with Sinatra, Kelly says he can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi
They spend the film trying to accomplish just that
<br /><br />My only disappointment in Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton, who plays the waitress 'Brooklyn' never got a number herself
She had gotten rave reviews from her performance as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway and that's what brought her to Hollywood
I have a suspicion she had a number that was cut and somewhere in MGM's vaults it might still be
<br /><br />Anchors Aweigh is a great example of why musicals just aren't made any more
All that creative talent was under contract to Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer
If you had to pay market value for it, the cost might retire some third world country's debt
<br /><br />But the film results would be extraordinary
Prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films, and there's a good reason for that because it's not one of the best
but as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer, this is certainly among the best of the lesser known/smaller films
The film does have some connection to blockbusters; for a start it's an early directorial effort for Renny Harlin; the capable director behind a number of action films including Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; and secondly we have an early role for Lord of the Rings star Viggo Mortensen
The film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting
We focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years
This was the prison where a man named Charles Forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prison's governor
Naturally, the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace; and when the old execution room is reopened, the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeance
<br /><br />The film is not exactly The Shawshank Redemption, but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror, the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base
This is a good job too because other than the basic premise, the film doesn't really have a 'plot' to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting
The horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but it's never over the top, which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered, being released in a decade of excess
The murders themselves are rather good and imaginative, however, and provide some major highlights
As the film goes on, we start to delve more into the back-story of the vengeful convict's ghost and while it's fairly interesting, some things about it don't make sense and it drags the film down a little
Still, everything boils down to an exciting climax and overall I have to say that Prison is a film well worth tracking down
This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural Cuban town the year of the Castro revolution
It is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love
<br /><br />The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film
It has more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to people's daily lives and pursuits
That fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in Cuban history
<br /><br />The excessive use of the voice-over narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from Hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator could
<br /><br />The comparisons to CINEMA PARADISO and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies, but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love
<br /><br />The revolution, like the film JULIE, never seems to have an ending
If you are a Crispin Glover fan, you must see this
If you are a Sean Penn fan, you must see this
If you are a movie fan in general, you must see this
If you have no idea who Crispin Glover is and you have no idea who Sean Penn is, this film will probably still have a lot of value, but the more work you've previously seen by Crispin or Sean, the better
<br /><br />This movie is so funny, but it is also pure genius
There is nothing that I know of that resembles this film
I doubt that anything like it will ever be made again
I cannot say anything more about exactly why without partially spoiling it, and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job at doing that
<br /><br />In response to any of the reviewers here that gave it a bad review, I ask that you view the film again
In reality, there is no point at which this film could fairly be called "boring
" This is possibly the funniest, most entertaining, and least boring film ever made
And it only gets better with age and repeated viewings
A timeless classic that, unfortunately, very few will be able to claim to have seen
<br /><br />Beaver Trilogy is the brilliant work of director Trent Harris, also responsible for the amazing Rubin and Ed, which Crispin Glover also stars in
<br /><br />Unfortunately, copies of this film are rare and hard to find
I managed to find a VHS version after some diligent searching though, and there are a couple of ways to find it that I know of
But I really wish someone would put this onto a DVD
As an animated film from 1978, this is pretty good--generally well above the standard of the days when Disney hadn't done anything good in years (and Tolkien cared little for Disney anyway)
It gets major points for innovative and careful camera work, applying cinematic techniques with relative success
The much-maligned rotoscoping actually works pretty well, especially with the Ringwraiths, and the opening narration
However, it is so drastically overused--possibly as a money-saving technique--that it detracts from the overall effect
The same technique that makes wraiths spooky and otherworldly doesn't fare so well in the Prancing Pony
<br /><br />As for the adaptation of the story, it's actually quite good
We lose little bits here and there, minor details such as the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil, the Gaffer and the Sackville-Bagginses
We compress a few characters, such as revising Legolas as one of Elrond's household and an old friend of Aragorn's, but that's a rather wise decision for film
In books you have room to include the references to the larger world of the Elves and Middle-Earth's vast history
In film, you trade that for visuals and sound that convey the same elements in a different way
Nothing critical is truly lost here, and although I have minor quibbles about some of the changes, I'm generally pretty happy with it
<br /><br />If only the dratted writers had managed to remember Saruman's name--he's frequently referred to as Aruman, a decision probably made to make him more distinct from similarly-named Sauron; it took me a second viewing before I was certain I hadn't misheard it
It's also annoying that Boromir is a bloody stage viking, and irritable from the start
However, Gandalf is excellent, and most of the rest of the voicework is excellent
If only John Hurt weren't too old to play Aragorn; I love his voice
<br /><br />Of course, with the film ending at the midpoint of the story, there's a vast disappointment built in
What makes it far, far worse is the altogether miserable job done by the Rankin & Bass crew on the sequel
That they were permitted to do Return of the King after butchering The Hobbit remains a huge mystery; they seem more interested in bad songs than in proper storytelling
For all its faults, this film's heart is solidly in place and it tries very hard to accomplish a nearly impossible task
I can only hope that the upcoming series of films keeps as true to its vision
Netflix should mention this short feature on the info for Silk Stockings
Superior in every way to that over-produced fluff
This had much better Cole Porter songs and lots more energy
Silk Stockings turned out to be a big disappointment
Fred was getting too old for this sort of thing, though the dances and Cyd are lovely
I will be on the watch for the Garbo--Melvyn Douglas version of Ninotchka
Was Peter Lorre ill during the making of Silk Stockings--he seems to be very passive in the more active numbers and with less lines? Very glad that I ran across Paree--Paree by pure accident
Made the whole experience a lot more enjoyable
Bob Hope, as a simple "song and dance man' is pure joy
If the themes of The Girl From Missouri sound familiar it should
That's because Anita Loos who wrote the screenplay here also wrote the classic Gentlemen Prefer Blondes
Unlike Marilyn Monroe in that film, Jean Harlow will accept any kind of jewelry from men of means
<br /><br />And it's men of means that Jean Harlow is after
She leaves the road side hash house run by her mother and stepfather because she's decided that the best way to gain the easy life is to marry it
Her talents as a chorus girl are limited, but she'll be able to trade in on that beauty
<br /><br />Her odyssey starts with her and friend Patsy Kelly getting an invitation to perform at a party thrown by millionaire Lewis Stone
But unbeknownst to Jean, Stone's just having a wild last fling before doing himself because of the moneys he owes not owns
Still she wrangles a few baubles from him that fellow millionaire Lionel Barrymore notices
<br /><br />Lionel's amused by it until Jean sets her sights on his playboy son, Franchot Tone
After that he is not amused and he looks to shake Jean from climbing the family tree
<br /><br />The Girl From Missouri went into production mid adaption of The Code so it went under peculiar censorship
I've a feeling we would have seen a much more risqué film
Still Jean Harlow as a younger and sassier version of Mae West is always appreciated
What a great comic talent that woman had, seeing The Girl From Missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss the world of film sustained with her passing three years later
<br /><br />Ironically enough the casting of Patsy Kelly with Harlow was no doubt influenced by the successful shorts Kelly was making with another famous platinum blonde, Thelma Todd
Harlow and Kelly have the same easy chemistry between that Patsy had with Thelma
Todd would also die a year later in a freak accident/suicide/homicide that no satisfactory explanation has ever really been given
<br /><br />Don't miss The Girl From Missouri, it's bright and sassy, must be from all that sparkling jewelry
Well executed old and very dark house horror
Good set-up which includes the character of Poe, himself, alluding to the story in a London pub
Although from here it is pretty much the one guy who has taken the dare to visit the house on a particular night running from room to room either looking for or avoiding people, it is still most enjoyable
Plus we have the delightful and enigmatic Barbara Steele
There is some wooden dialogue and some unexplained bits and bobs but it is the super creepy atmosphere that is maintained throughout, that and the super musical score that keep this one moving nicely along
DVD originates from US and has a few extra
This is a classic British comedy-thriller I had always wanted to check out but no opportunity had arisen for that until now
It's based on a popular stage play which had already been filmed a number of times previously (most notably in 1931 by the same director but, unfortunately, this version seems not to have survived in its entirety!); for the remake under review, the plot has been updated to the then-current wartime situation
<br /><br />Anyway, I was mainly familiar with early British comedians through the films of Will Hay: given that this one features a similar plot of legendary hauntings, smuggling and enemy agents, it's very much in that vein (it was actually scripted by Hay's regular writing team of Marriott Edgar, Val Guest and J
Orton); the stranded travelers element, then, was an equally tried-and-true formula
The star this time around is Arthur Askey (abetted by Richard Murdoch) - none of whose films I had watched before - who is as unlikely a hero as Hay himself and whose personality proves to be just as potentially irritating
but one soon warms up to him, and Askey certainly comes up with a number of witty lines and amusing bits of business throughout to justify the fact that the lead character of the play (and the 1931 film version) was split into two here, with Murdoch acting as the star's straight partner
<br /><br />The remote single setting (the events of the film largely take place during one stormy night) provides for some wonderful atmosphere; the last half-hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and eventually the arrival of the titular vehicle itself - is especially gripping and well handled
Also worth mentioning from the remaining cast list is Kathleen Harrison as the stereotypical frightened spinster, with a parrot as her constant companion and who is driven by all the excitement to take her very first drink
Does anyone know the exact quote about "time and love" by George Ede aka, Father Fitzpatrick in the move, It had to be you? He was talking to Charlie and Annna in the church as they were leaving? If not I will have to rent the movie
I also loved Serendipity! Great love story for the soul! <br /><br />I met my one true love (my Soulmate) and although I had the experience to meet him when I had least expecting it, I wasn't ready for that kind of emotional relationship
<br /><br />Altho, we did marry, I wasn't mature enough to give as much as I thought I would
I got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for 7 years
<br /><br />He finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry & in disbelief about the way it turned out
I had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart 3 years
<br /><br />This movie meant a lot because I am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love
I can NOW appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of Father Fitzpatrick rang true for me
<br /><br />I know when he has healed enough to trust me again, we will remarry
<br /><br />Don't EVER GET COMPLACENT AND TAKE TRUE LOVE FOR GRANTED! IT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST LESSON OF MY LIFE
<br /><br />Also the music in this movie is OUTSTANDING and MEANINGFUL! This movie is DEEP and spiritually uplifting
TRUE LOVE is worth waiting for, if it is meant to be, it will, no matter what, IT WILL HAPPEN! Nothing is impossible, even when it's the second time around! Thanks
The entire 10:15 minute presentation is done in a very non-threatening and non-medical way that even preteen children can easily understand
It dispels many of the myths surrounding menstruation that were going around in those days (1946) While sex is not explicitly mentioned, the part about fertilization is
This is also, purportedly, the first Hollywood production to ever use the word "vagina" in the dialogue
<br /><br />It is cute how the animated character is shown topless in the shower in a purely animated character way with no defining features as was the way of the day
Many of the Betty Boop cartoons showed her undress without revealing any defining features either
Max Fleischer was a bit of a card and did this with many of the Betty Boop cartoons which required frame-by-frame viewing to find them
<br /><br />There is no mention at the beginning or end of the film as to who the female narrator is
In fact, there are no credits whatsoever other than those mentioning Kotex and Kimberly-Clark Corporation
<br /><br />This title is nearly impossible to attain; but for those who are Bittorrent downloaders, it can be found out there in the ether
This is one of those "keepers" that will become increasingly hard to find as older short subject features fade into obscurity
This is a excellent start to the film career of Mickey Rooney
His talents here shows that a long career is ahead for him
The car and truck chase is exciting for the 1937 era
This start of the Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book
Spring Byington performance is excellent as usual
Please Mr Rooney or owners of the film rights, take a chance and get this produced on DVD
After becoming completely addicted to Six Feet Under, I didn't think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as good as this show
Well, I was wrong! Lost is spellbinding!! I absolutely love this show and cannot turn it off
The richness of the characters, the intricacies of the plot, the beautiful setting are all amazing
I don't know how the creators do it, but each character touches me very deeply
I feel their joy, their pain, everything, right down to my core!!! I don't have cable so I've been renting the series on Netflix
When I put it on I watch all the episodes at once and feel sad when it is over
I can't wait for the next disc to arrive at my house
This is probably the best TV show I have ever seen!!
Fair drama/love story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new love
The acting here is good but the film fails in cinematography,screenplay,directing and editing
This film will be enjoyed by Fonda and De Niro fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the coartship is on a more wiser and cautious level
It would also be interesting for people who are interested on the subject matter regarding illiteracy
Definitely one of the most witty and twisted who-dunnit I ever seen
Christopher Reeve and Micheal Caine were brilliant and kept me going through the whole affair
<br /><br />Very classy set pieces and the props really lend a sense of atmosphere to the proceedings
The minimalist feel works for the whole picture
<br /><br />My only complain isn't with the film itself but the lack of a decent widescreen edition of the movie on DVD
I own the fullscreen version (which proves I love the film enough to endure fullscreen presentation) but a awesome Deluxe or 'special' edition would most surely get my cash
"The Invisible Mouse" is a delightful and different Tom & Jerry's cartoon
It features the usual cat/mouse chases and battles, but in a different way this time
Jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of "surprises" for Tom, scare him, torment him and confuse him
<br /><br />As much as it is weird, it's also very cool and funny to see what we can't see: Jerry invisible
It's amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who's doing it (we know who, right?) - it's like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts
It's equally amusing to see Jerry eating some candies and fruits while he's invisible
I really like that instrumental music which plays when he's not visible
<br /><br />Some of the best jokes on this short are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and slams him and even when Tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and Jerry writes "Missed me"
I also like when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk, becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face
<br /><br />Overall, this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun and some nice artwork too
Viewing "Impulse" is a very satisfying experience
Unpredictable films are such a rarity, when one comes along like "Impulse", it is something to embrace
The script is logical, and extremely creative
Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn, and Bill Paxton, give believable performances
This could have played out like a zombie movie, but "Impulse" is far superior to any boring "zombiefest", and originality shines through in almost every scene
You get the feeling that something like this could have actually happened, even though the script is pure fiction
From the "grabber" opening till the credits roll, you will be fascinated
Very entertaining and definitely recommended
I wish "that '70s show" would come back on television
It was the greatest show ever!!! They should make episodes between the other episodes but of course that would be confusing
But I wish it would come back and make more episodes
You couldn't laugh without seeing an episode
There is a really funny part in every episode and plus the show was so much better when Hyde and Jackie were going out with each other
It will be and always will be the best show ever
The ideas would be repeated by Mamet, but never told so succinctly
This is really about the failure of trust, of the human condition
The film weaves the idea that we are all criminals, no one is innocent
Is there anyone alive today who hasn't seen this play out in our own society, every single day? The film is very much structured like a Hitchcock thriller
Except, there are no more innocent characters
The world is now completely polluted, ruined and everyone is participating in the con
Could anything be more true?<br /><br />Don't miss the soundtrack
I can watch B,B&C and feel all the emotions I felt when I first saw it at aged 18 well,maybe all but one
Novak has lost none of her silky allure in nearly half a century
All those thinking youths now collecting their pensions can briefly regain the heart - clutching,collar - tightening,blood - pulsing ardour they felt when she gazed directly into their eyes back in the days when they were being told that they had never had it so good
Now,huddled up against the cold and fearful of being mugged by a Hoodie,they scuttle home as fast as their arthritic knees can carry them from the Video Shop,relatively happy in the certain knowledge that within the triple - locked comparative safety of their fourth - floor tower block flat they can regain just a small fragment of their lost youth and perhaps reflect that love truly is eternal
She seized it avidly and gave a performance of awesome voluptuousness combined with a hypnotic awareness of her own sex - appeal and,despite all this,she convinces us that her character possesses a strange and beguiling innocence
She completely dominates the amiable Mr J
Stewart who seems resigned to handing her the movie
Gingold offer comic relief along with Mr E
Kovacs whose peculiar talents are strictly proscribed
He is a beatnik,a species that disappeared as soon as it realised that its existence was being acknowledged by the mainstream
Some of the more hardcore beats reinvented themselves as hippies a few years later
Certainly they had become figures of fun by 1958 and Mr Lemmon does not appear overly concerned with restraint in portraying one
But all else is mere frippery,Miss Novak - bathed in a particularly beautiful spectrum of Technicolor - is the sole raison - d'etre for "Bell,Book and Candle"
It survives,its reputation enhanced,as the ultimate showcase for one of Hollywood's most beautiful women
Loved by moviegoers,ignored by critics,Miss Novak will continue to captivate with that enigmatic smile all the time thinking old men have the strength to push the "Play" buttons on their DVDs
One day,probably after we are all gone,she will be discovered by a new generation who will - belatedly - realise that it is quite possible for a woman to be fully - dressed and sexually attractive at the same time
In todays context of supporting our troops, it is interesting this movie showed the lack of respect soldiers received from doing their duty, during this period
From a historical view, the end of the Vietnam war left all of us with something to remember and learn from
Gene was very proud of this movie, and he deserved the credits he received from writing "Green Eyes"
I agree, I do not understand why this movie is not shown more often, or at all
This movie is the kind of movie that should be shown on TV every year, much like the Wizard of Oz
The dedication of one man towards his lost son is entirely moving
I was a friend of Gene Logans and I was proud to know him
I've seen this film on Sky Cinema not too long ago
I must admit, it was a really good Western which features 2 of the big names
On one side, there's Charlton Heston, playing the infamous and retired lawman Samuel Burgade
The late James Coburn playing the villainous Zach Provo
seeking revenge on Burgade no matter what the cost
!<br /><br />The good thing about this film was there was some really good characters
Most of the actors played it out really well
Especially James Coburn, who I find that he was really mean in this film
<br /><br />Christopher Mitchum, who I've seen everywhere in other films
I felt his character was left out in the cold, but he manage to get himself back in by teaming up with Burgade, to bring down Provo's posse's!<br /><br />All in all, it was a great film
Great score from the late Jerry Goldsmith
<br /><br />Wonderful piece of Western persona
My room-mate ordered this one off of the web a while back and I finally got around to watching it
I mean, this was the most fun we have had watching a movie like this since "City Of The Walking Dead" ages ago
It was like being at the old Drive-In Theater again! You could tell the guy who made this movie liked all the horrible dubbed zombie movies
This one has all the cliches and tricks from those films rolled into one, and it's neat because it is SUPPOSE to be like that
The cheeze factor is high, the gore flows and the laughs roll! The effects go from sloppy to good, with the one where the guy gets torn in half and the one where a guy gets his heart shoved through his chest both being excellent! The acting goes from terrible to actually pretty good
There is not much plot, just lots and lots of gore
This one is patterned after the zombie movies from Italy and Spain I think, because they linger on the gross scenes forever, like this movie
If you like Troma movies, cheezy B-grade stuff, then you can do no wrong watching this one
I thought How The Grinch Stole Christmas was a pretty good movie
It wasn't horrible, nor was it great, but it was enjoyable to watch
I felt as if Jim Carrey got a little annoying at times
They made the Grinch seem like a special education person, when all he needed to be was evil and devious, but yet he turned out kind of retarded
I did think the scenery, when not inside the Grinch's cave, was beautiful, and there was a few parts where I laughed, but most of the time I thought it was just annoying
This movie could've been "SO" much better if they had changed the Grinch's personality, and they had included some more laugh scenes, because most of the humor wasn't funny
I liked How The Grinch Stole Christmas anyway, but it's not anything to get excited about seeing
The Master Blackmailer, based off of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short story, "the Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton," is the first feature length Sherlock Holmes story with Jeremy Brett that I have seen
The film has a somewhat dreary, sad feel to it, but it is quite entertaining (with some especially funny scenes)
<br /><br />*Spoilers* Sherlock Holmes and Dr
Watson attempt to uncover the identity of an illusive blackmailer who has been ruining some of the most prominent families of England by publishing private letters that will, in one way or another, destroy their lives
They eventually find out that he is Charles Augustus Milverton, an "art dealer," after the few tragic consequences for victims that could not pay up
Our heroes must next help Lady Eva Blackwell, who must pay a sum that is beyond her means or else her upcoming marriage will most definitely be called off
The scene in which Holmes and Watson burglarize Milverton's house are intense
Although the film has an essentially happy ending, the tone is sad and regretful
<br /><br />Outstanding performances by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual), and Robert Hardy as the notorious villain (most audiences probably recognize him today as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter), Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson as Agatha (the scenes involving her and Holmes are a riot)
My only complaint is that there wasn't enough Inspector Lestrade
(I wish they would have added in the scene at the end of the short story where he gives the description of the two burglars, one of which matches Watson
Call me a walking mail cliché but include violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs etc
on a show and you're already winning points on in my book
Combine all that with acting that superceeds anything you've ever seen on the small screen, add directing that fits cinema of the vintage type and most of all writing that blows the mind (and a few brains a long the way) and you got yourself a show thats gonna be pretty tough to compete with
<br /><br />Above all stand two actors, James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco as His wife Carmela
as for Gandolfini, he fits his roll in a way that words cannot express, if you haven't seen him as tony yet see it now!<br /><br />I can go on and on and on about every character in the show, the psychological brilliance, the gripping scenes etc
but you wouldn't be able to stop me so all I can say is that this is about the only show along with Seinfeld, that I am able to watch over and over again from start to finish and end up enjoying it even more
The idea ia a very short film with a lot of information
Interesting, entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more
The producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that cannot be compared to any other short film that I have seen
I have rated this film at the highest possible rating
I also recommend that it is shown to office managers and business people in any establishment
What comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas are never listened to, their voice is never heard
It is a lesson to be learned by any office that wants to go forward
I hope that the produced will produce a second part to this 'idea'
Once again congrats to Halaqah media in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind
** Warning - this post may contain spoilers **<br /><br />I only got a Gamecube in September 2005, and the first two games I bought were James Bond games, the decent Agent Under Fire and the dull Goldeneye Rogue Agent
The next game I planned to get was Everything or Nothing, because my friend told me that it was better than the two games I already had
<br /><br />I bought this for a tenner in HMV, and when I got home, I slammed it in to my Cube and played it for hours on end
It was much better than my other two games, and there was a much better and more interesting storyline
Graphics were some of the best I have seen (but now that the XBOX 360 has come out, Farcry Instincts Predator has some of the best graphics known to man)
The storyline was clever; mad man (Willem Dafoe, named as Nikolai Diavolo) and beautiful henchwoman (Heidi Klum, named as Katya Nadanova), try to destroy the world with tiny nanobots, which at the start of the game, you, James Bond, have to destroy on a train
The bad thing is that one of them is hidden in Katya's boobs
You then have to thwart their plans and save the world
<br /><br />The great thing about this game is that it actually has actors voicing the characters, such as Cleese voicing Q
There are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them pretty long and tricky
<br /><br />Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Replay value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10<br /><br />I give this game a grand total of 90
Demons have infested Edo, taking possession of earthly forms and bending them to their unholy will
On top of that, the rebirth of Ashura, Queen of the demons, is nigh
The only thing that stands against this grave threat are the Demon Wardens, a fearsome group of warriors, who might just be as bad as the demons themselves
<br /><br />Izumo is a retired Demon Warden, who five years ago, took up theater instead of Demon Slaying after accidentally killing a innocent child (In a battle that's strangely reminiscent of the bar scene from Dusk till Dawn)
One night by a chance encounter he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki
Their fortunes intertwine (literally) and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies
<br /><br />If you think this sounds like your typical Japanese Fantasy/Swordplay epic, you'd be wrong
In fact, there's nothing typical about Ashura
It is a hodge-podge of many different genre's of film
Those just mentioned, as well as a comedy, drama, and romance
Director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) juggles the genre's fairly respectfully (Although, the comedy seems forced in some scenes) and the end result is a ridiculous, but really fun popcorn movie
<br /><br />To be sure, there are flaws in the film
Some of the humor seems contrived, and out of place
But seriously, do you watch Fantasy/Swordplay/Comedy films for the great acting performances?? No, we watch them for the action and the crazy CG visuals, all of which Ashura has in Spades
Not to be misleading, the film is not all action, but it is spaced out generously enough with lots of swordplay and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happy
<br /><br />Bottom line; the films has it's faults and is not a martial arts epic, but it doesn't try to be and it features interesting visuals and good swordplay action
The reason the film worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the viewer does the same, their sure to be delighted by this fun and silly swordplay fantasy action flick
For starters I have always been a fan of the Batman cartoons because the theme is so universal, 'that everyone alive has an alter-ego'
While the overall story is good I'm disappointed that they haven't really done much for the franchise with this
<br /><br />Throughout the movie, you are trying to find out who the identity of Batwoman is, unfortunately you can find out by easily looking at the cast of credits posted on this website (so if you haven't seen it already don't go there)
I was sort of disappointed that they didn't make the movie longer
75 minutes is way too short for any movie
The secret identity of batwoman also comes far too early in the movie, sort of midway, and becomes anti-climatic afterward because you know the good guys will always win and that the new character known as Batwoman will disappear after the movie is over
<br /><br />I'm also not too sure about the new animation style used in this movie
I love the sleek new characters but there should be some more detail where detail is called for
Some parts of the animation look so awkward and rigid that it grabs your attention right away diverting your attention away from the storyline
I also didn't really like the bright atmosphere used in most of the scenes, it sort of loses its dark and gothic feel which is Batman
Similarly we should've gotten to know more about batwoman's personality so that we can build the same deep compassionate feeling that we do with Bruce Wayne
Also I think the fight with Bane should have been done better
In typical children's fashion the bad guy meets his demise too easily either by tripping, falling, getting electricuted or doing something dumb that works against them
Come to think of it there wasn't even one drop of blood spilled in this movie either
<br /><br />Bottom line, its a good entertaining flick and I recommend anyone who's a Batman fan to watch it
It has good storyline, universal appeal and even great acting to top it off
I just wish that they could have delivered more permanent change to the story by making Batwoman stay to make things more interesting
Not just introduce her and then kick her off once she's done
I'd also like to see someone else figure out the mystery for a change finally
To have some other than Batman solve the mystery and fill him in later with the details
<br /><br />I hope there are more animated movies to come and look forward to the time when we will actually be able to see the breakup between Bruce Wayne and Barbra Gordan
He's been stringing her along forever and doesn't even like her and I can't believe that she was dumb enough to fall in love with someone 20 years older
I also want to see the time when Tim Drake leaves because he is getting sick of the old man
In short I want to see all of the things that led the characters to where they will be in Batman Beyond
Otherwise the same repeated formula will just end it faster than if they just decided to move on with the story
Esther Williams gets her first post MGM starring role and gets off<br /><br />to a good start
This film is a well acted entertaining suspense<br /><br />with a mature theme that would be repeated a million times more<br /><br />in the future - innocent girl stalked creepy woman hater
Esther<br /><br />looks great and if she wanted to, probably could have gone on to<br /><br />do more and better films but according to her autobiography, <br /><br />pretty much gave up working for marriage
Either way she is so<br /><br />likable and engaging that its fun to see her in a totally different role<br /><br />outside of the 'swimming musical'
Universal was fabulous for<br /><br />making films with former MGM stars after that studio began<br /><br />dropping its biggest names as it began to slide down hill
Stars<br /><br />like Lana Turner, June Allyson and others got to make quality first<br /><br />rate films at Universal as they obviously still had drawing power at<br /><br />the box office
I wish Esther had made more but since she didnt, it<br /><br />makes this one all the more special
It doesn't 'hang well' together as the story line is basically a bunch of hooks to hang jokes
<br /><br />Some of these jokes are a little 'too 80s' and tend to date the picture
<br /><br />But some of these jokes are classic
<br /><br />You know a movie has something special when you and your friends still reference silly quotes from it over 2 decades later
<br /><br />Plus, there are a bunch of familiar faces; Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Joe Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dunne, and one of the last roles of Alan Hale Jr
<br /><br />Also, there are some great absurdist moments, like when Johnny is labelling the puppies with a pricing gun, or the Pope making an appearance in Johnny's neighborhood
Also, the scene where the fake priest makes up a lot of words in Latin is excellent
("Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, the radio's too louda
Post meridian, ante meridian, uncle meridian")
<br /><br />Other Classic Scenes include Ramone Maroney butchering the English language Danny Devito urging Griffin Dunne to 'Play Ball' Peter Boyle thinking he lost his manhood The fake VD movie<br /><br />This movie is no home run
But like 'Porky's', it has enough classic comedy bits to make it memorable
Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar, and Yvonne De Carlo star in this funny, funny movie
The late Fred Gwynne is truly wonderful as Herman Munster who lives with Grandpa Munster (Al Lewis), wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo), and his son and daughter
Sid Caesar is hilarious as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the Munster family
When the wax figures of Herman and Grandpa begin to terrorize the town everyone blames the two
The two now have to clear their names before it's too late
Garde à Vue has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the sub-plots it contains
If you're not used to french wordy films, based upon conversation and battle of wits rather than on action, don't even try to watch it
You'll only obtain boredom to death, and reassured opinion that french movies are not for you
<br /><br />Garde à Vue is a wordy film, essentially based upon dialogs (written by Audiard by the way)and it cruelly cuts the veil of appearances
<br /><br />Why does Maître Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be unduly accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth ? Because at the time of the murder he was with a 18 years old girl with which he has a 8-years sexual relation
His wife knows it, she's jealous of it and he prefers to be executed (in 1980 in France, there was still death penalty)rather than unveiling the sole "pure and innocent" aspect of his pitiful life
It is a classic depiction of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees
Antonio Montana(played by Al Pacino), is just one of the thousands to get a chance to choose his destiny in America
This cinematic yet extremely accurate depiction of Miamis' Drug Empire is astonishing
Brian DePalma does an amazing job directing this picture, so much that, the viewer becomes involved with both the storyline, as well as every character in the cast
With Tony's characters' pressence being so believable and strong, Brian DePalma brang out the raw talent exposed by Steven Bauer(Manny, Tony's best Friend), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio(Gina, Tony's Sister), Robert Loggia(Frank, Tony's Boss)and Michelle Pfeiffer(Elvira, Frank's Wife)
I enjoyed every minute watching this movie, and still watch it on a weekly basis
On this year, the 20th Anniversary of this classic crime movie, I for one am a true believer that in another 20 years people will still refer to this movie in astonishing numbers
With other crime movies being so dramatic I find, this movie is a shock to the system
Daniell Steel's Daddy, what a refreshing story
This movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children
How rare is that? In these times of "Heather has two Mommies" (or what ever, you fill in the blanks) it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone
With the father's roles being prominent I was hoping this would be another Daniell Steel Saga
Every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role
I would have loved to see each character develop over the years
I loved this movie, it is one I will defiantly watch every time it's on
Good story, good acting, and I hope this isn't a spoiler, but no obtrusive sex or bad language
What I find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment, be it Television or
Daniell if your listening, You Go Girl, give us more
Thanks to this fungal film I do NOT want my Maypo, can't stomach the thought of Maltex or Wheatena, and even that granola over there doesn't look so innocent anymore! Why wasn't the song "Slop Time", by the Sherrys, used as the theme
I saw this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and there was not a dry eye in the house
It is incredible to see not only what a great person Darius is, but how admirable the rest of the team is too and at such a young age
<br /><br />It also made me think how disgusting MTV was, and how on being given an opportunity to involve and inspire in a positive way, they declined
Shows you whether they really care about the youth and their viewers at all
<br /><br />It's a wonderful and heart warming true story
take your tissues but it's great to see how caring and inspiring youth of today can be
"COSBY," in my opinion, is a must-see CBS hit! I'm not sure if I've never seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it
It's hard to say which one is my favorite
If you ask me, even though I liked everyone, it would have been nice if Madeline Kahn hadn't passed away during the show's run
Since that happened, I've always wondered what the show would have been like
Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong
In conclusion, even though it can be seen on TBS now, I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for goo
Everyone should totally see this movie! It's freaking scary, but doesn't resort to lame "jump-out-at-you-just-to-surprise-you-and-pass-it-off-as-scary" things
See this freaking awesome movie!!! The director is Stanley Kubrick, easily the greatest director who ever lived
Every single one of his movies are masterpieces, including this one
The Shining is about this family that goes to a hotel in the Colorado Rockies as caretakers for the winters, and get snowed in
The husband is easily impacted by evil haunted hotels, and
It becomes this gripping thriller where stuff gets thrown at the viewer from all different directions, and it gets scary
Not just the classic, "Here's Johnny" scene
It's memorable, but can't speak for the whole movies
It's one of those things where words don't explain it adequately, and you just gotta see it
So go on Netflix, and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT!!!!!!
This movie is horrible, but you have to see it because of that
I'm not here to discuss the entire film, just the greatest chase scene ever
When Eddie dumbs milk on Tim, he gets chased down the hallway
Eddie puts obstacles in the jocks way with hilarious consequences (like a cymbal nailing a trumpet player; buy the DVD and watch it slow)
The best obstacle is a knocked over mop bucket which one jock jumps over but proceeds to slide on the ground out a door
But when he slides he picks up speed thus defying physics (mainly friction); yet what lies behind the door is supreme
The steepest stair case in any school ever, which this jock proceeds to CLEAR in the air
In reality he probably would die of a broken neck
Not only does he defy all concepts of reality, he makes the funniest noise ever made in that situation
Trust me this scene is worth your 6 bucks
I think 'Blackadder the Third' is the best one of the series
<br /><br />Actuelly all the episodes are funny, personally i really like the episode with the 'French invasion', but the one with the superstitious actors, in 'MACBETH' is also really funny, the way Rowan keeps playing on with them is really (English) Humor at the highest level
<br /><br />Actors: 'Never say that again, always call it the Scottish Play; Blackadder: Oh, So you want me to say the Scottish Play? Actors: YES Blackadder: Rather than MACBETH
!<br /><br />I am a big fan of Rowan and i have the majority of his work, but i think he did the series of Blackadder especially good
<br /><br />I Hope Rowan is going to continue his great style, but i think we can count on him, because he is already working on a Bean 2 Movie, that will be out this year, i can't wait
<br /><br />I Give this 3rd Blackadder a 9 out of 10 Rating
I am quite the Mitchell Leisen fan so it was a great anticipation that I rented this movie but the print I got was extremely bad, so worn down from use and scorched seemingly beyond repair, the movie was so dark
So dark that in certain scenes that are cinematographed in the dark, you can't see a single thing
That said, I believe I share the same opinion as the first review of this movie
It starts out unusually and does not tote the lines and rhythms of your typical Hollywood 30's movie
Heck, not even your typical Hollywod movie of any era
It seems the director has been influenced by the Europeans because there is a certain caustic realism to the proceedings from the opening shot which is so crafted in camera movement and placement as Maggie (Carole Lombard) and Skid (Fred Macmurray) meet
You half expect them to start singing "Make believe" from Show boat
It starts with a few laughs and poor Anthony in a one scene role where he speaks not a word of English gets slapped around by Freddie
Skids is a bum who doesn't care that he's a bum
That's why he signs up in the army where he can hide from the world
He's just been released though and in a set of screenplay shenanigans, she misses her boat for New York
This is when the movie kicks into high gear and we begin to get those French movie of the sixties vibes to the whole proceedings
The scenes are so well acted by Lombard and Cecil Cunningham, the movie gains a pulse
MacMurray is good too as he and Lombard fall for each other as she nurtures his talent for the trumpet
Then the temptress arrives in the form of Dorothy Lamour
The movie has fantastic montage sequences that dazzled me
And Lombard scores a home run in this movie but in the second half, a bit more is called of Freddie and he fails to deliver the goods
With a heavily melodramatic ending and an actor you don't believe, the movie falls short but since it is not your typical movie in structure, set design, and direction
For what is what it was one of the 37 hits of the 1936-37 season
i chose to see the this film on the day it opened nationally in france, as a personal way for myself to reflect on what had happened a year previous; the collection works as intended: it provokes a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions, working as an intellectual hommage, never stooping to cheap sentimentality nor knee-jerk reactionism
<br /><br />there have been many allegations made that the film is anti-american: while i cannot speak for everyone in this regard, i am one american who found such statements to be completely untrue
people make much noise about the egyptian segment, by Chahine, because it voices perspectives of palestinian suicide bombers asserting that civilians in a democracy are "fair targets" for they elect the governments the bombers are seeking to attack, but this ignores much else in the piece: several perspectives are discussed, no one being held up as the truth, and critics--if they even saw the piece--seem to forget the fondness and warm dialogue that takes place between the director and the ghost of the american dialogue, and the director's intense sadness upon hearing of the tragedy
<br /><br />pretty much all of the films are beautiful, thoughtful & inspiring, in particular the brilliant work by Mahkmalbaf, Tanovic, Loach & Inarritu
Nair, good as usual, effectively tells a true story of an injustice committed against a muslim family in the wake of anti-islam hysteria that swept--and still sweeps--the states
i did find Gitai's piece a bit vulgarly loud and simple in it's critic of media hysteria in the face of terrorism, and Penn's piece was too impressionistic and elliptical for my tastes, though i had expected to like it
SPOILER WARNING: one reviewer below incorrectly read the falling of the towers as being a happy moment for the character; my read is rather that the falling of the towers is what, because light floods his room, keys him into the loss in his life that he refused to recognize
again this is a sort of impressionistic piece, for we know that if the towers were really blocking the light to this man's flat, then there would have been nothing but smoke and ash, not light, flooding through his window
As someone else has already said here, every scene in this film is gem
Most films are lucky to have one scene that is perfect, but director Jewison hit a home run every time
The cast got just the right take on the excellent script, and in addition, Dick Hyman's musical settings of the opera and the other music made for a perfect match
Hard to imagine how they kept the precise mood going throughout the long production of a film
The comedy is subtle (mostly), and the camera-work mirrors every little emotional inflection of the narrative
Cher is such a comedy natural, Vincent Gardenia (who I know mostly through his Frank Lorenzo role on All in the Family until I saw him in this and then off-Broadway in the 80's)deserved far greater stardom than he ever got, and Aiello's hapless loser are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving kudos to this tremendous cast
Has Jewison ever written about this film?<br /><br />Would love to read it
Hard to figure out why the average rating here at IMDb is so low
Bill and Ted are back, only this time an evil dude from the future has sent back an evil Bill and Ted to destroy them, thus destroying 'Wyld Stallions' and the basis for human society in the future
This time Bill and Ted have to travel through the afterlife 'Totally Bogus' and save humanity 'Excellent'<br /><br />With much of the same zany humour and some wonderful new characters like the grim reaper, station and robot Bill and Ted (stations creation) Bogus Journey once again entertains, and is worth watching for its soundtrack alone
<br /><br />7/10 <br /><br />A most triumphant sequel <br /><br />Party on Dudes! Heh
The brilliance of this movie is that even a competent dentist is pretty scary
This movie is the nightmarish image every kid has to go through in the waiting room
Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly non-lackluster performance as a crazed dentist who I guess tries to kill people but he only works on their teeth so it's not really working out
In a particularly gory scene we find so-so actor Earl Boen having his teeth completely destroyed with drills and whatnot, which I guess is the absolute worst you can do when you're a killer dentist
It's a typical Brian Yuzna situation, not well written but there's gore
The plot is shoddy and at times seems to be made up on the spot but hey, it's a killer dentist movie, we've all thought of it but they did it first
I had heard this film was a study of a landscape photographer's art by presenting the beauty in man's deconstructing the natural landscape
It certainly showed the laborious activities to find locations, setup shots, and capture stark images whose final destinations were art studios worldwide
Put together in moving pictures it is truly a horror show
<br /><br />This film oozes by you supplanting the shock of ghastly images with gentle waves of a wonderful industrial soundtrack that guides you like on slow moving river
Each sequence stands on its own, but in combination you get deeper and deeper into the feeling of overwhelming inevitability
There are few words, this allowing the grandeur in what is shown to preach in its own way
An awful, massive factory filled with human automata who live in hopelessly lifeless dormitories
Individuals dying early while rummaging for recyclable scraps in mountains of our E-waste
The birthing of gigantic ships and their destruction by hand in giant graveyards
The construction of the Three Gorges Dam, the largest industrial project in human history and likely for all time
The time lapse as a city dies and is simultaneously reborn into a replica of modernity that purposefully destroys all relics of the culture that was
<br /><br />The most terrifying image for me was a dam engineer explaining that the most important function of the dam was flood control
The shot shifts to the orchard behind the spokesperson where you witness the level of the last flood by the toxic water having eaten the bark from the trees, demonstrating that nothing but the most hideous vermin could be living in the waters
<br /><br />The obvious not being stated is far more powerful than your normal preachy Save the Earth documentaries
The artist Edward Burtynsky explains the method wonderfully
'By not saying what you should see  many people today sit in an uncomfortable spot where you don't necessarily want to give up what we have but we realize what we're doing is creating problems that run deep
The subtlety of this descends into an either/or proposition, but the film images scream that the decision has very much been made in favor of the dark side
<br /><br />Though never stated directly in any way, as the waves of what you witness wash away from your awareness and you contemplate, there is only one conclusion possible  we are doomed
The progress of mankind that is inexorable from our natures leaves behind carnage that this artist finds terrifying beauty in
What he is actually capturing are the tracks of we the lemmings rushing unconsciously toward our own demise
Unlike most films with environmental themes, this one ends with no call to arms
It argues basically what's the point, but makes certain you place the blame properly on all of us equally
I am not a very good writer, so I'll keep this short
World at War is the best WWII documentary that I've seen
I've seen different WWII documentaries (not only English/North American) and this documentary seems to be the most complete WWII documentary that I've seen
I think it could talk a bit more about the Great Depression and why/how Hitler got to power, but it does a very good job at covering the war
It seems to be complete and objective/fair to everyone
It does not exaggerate or diminish roles of different nations
It has a lot of original footage, including color footage and many eye witnesses (it was made in 70's when a lot more were alive)
All-in-All I gave this one 10/10, because it's that good
(I haven't seen specials in DVD version so I cannot comment on those
This was my first introduction to the world of Bollywood and I'm now hooked! Okay so it requires adoption of a different mindset to watching US films but once you allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying it for what it is you won't be disappointed
The songs are superb, melodic and very catchy
The actors are visually compelling especially Karisma Kapoor who is surely one of the most beautiful actresses anywhere in the film world
If you want something different and are looking to be uplifted, cheered up and stimulated I recommend you catch this movie
The second alternate Gundam universe tale (G-Gundam being the first), Gundam Wing is yet another different view into the Gundam verse
The familiar elements are found but Gundam Wing is actually different then its counterparts
The biggest being the Gundams are nothing more than terrorists combating one lone organization
In truth, the series doesn't really become a show about war until episode 7 but in truth the real conflict, the Eve Wars, don't happen until the later episodes
<br /><br />The greatest positives of this series are it's characters
All the main characters are fleshed out throughout the 49 episode run and you can really sympathize with each of the roles their put in
Another great plus is the fantastic character and mecha design of the series
The designs put some of it's other Gundam counterparts to shame
<br /><br />One of the biggest criticism of this series is how many die hard UC fans claim rip off of the original UC saga
Why Gundam Wing gets this rap when the more apparent UC clone of Gundam Seed is out there is beyond me
True there are many moments lifted but their told in new ways and there are distinct differences as well
<br /><br />Take for example, the usual comparison of Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable
Throughout the series, Zechs is more the outcast in the Alliance and in ways OZ as well, while the Red Comet was shining symbol of Zeon
Another big difference is the fact Zechs loses a lot soldiers under his command hence the other nickname he's given in the early episodes: "Killer of his own men
<br /><br />The problems with this series isn't the philosophy mumbo jumbo but two problems
The first is the reused animation footage of the Gundams attacks
Sure it's fun seeing Heavy Arms attack tanks, MS, and planes the first time
But on it's fourth re-use scenes like this do get old
<br /><br />The second problem is that the entire series is supposed to take place during an entire year
If you really think about all the events springing in the series, a lot happens in just one lone year
<br /><br />But I guess you can easily dismiss this fact when ignoring the intro's first lines every so often
As it ranks, this is probably the best of the Alternate universe Gundam tales and a great introduction into the Gundam world
After all, this was the very first Gundam anime to air in the US television
When I watched this film the first time, it was a taped copy and the title was/is Caged Terror
I still own the tape, and I confess, I've watched it more than once from beginning to end! The film is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often unintentionally amusing! I have gotten a few of my friends to watch this and we've had some great laughs from the terrible script
The film concerns a couple, (remember this is like early 70's so they are just too hip man!) who go on a week-end camping trip in what I believe was supposed to be upstate NY
They have some hilarious dialogue after catching and eating a fish and the girl bemoans the death of the fish and that they ate it! The guy comes back with something goofy about how they ate the fish and now it was a part of them, and he goes; "And that's beautiful man!" Heavy man, really heavy! LOL! Anyway, along come a couple of Vietnam vets, one of who plays the flute, I believe
(At any rate they are musical fellows!) The guys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple prove unfriendly, they end up terrorizing them during the night
The guy ends up caged in a chicken coop, and has to watch his girl friend being ravished by the two guys
Actually, by the end of the night, she seems to be pretty into it, and when morning comes, the guys leave and the girl and guy are free to leave
Supposedly the guy has learned a lesson about how to treat people, and the girl has a smile on her face! :) Anyway, I would recommend this film highly to anyone looking for a damn good laugh! It never fails to amuse me anyway! If I could find this on DVD and replace my old tape copy, I'd actually buy it again, it's classic camp! You gotta love this stuff
In a year of pretentious muck like "Synecdoche, New York" a film born out of Charlie Kaufman's own self-indulgence, comes a film that is similarly hard to watch but about three times as important
"Frownland" is a labor of love by the crew, the actors and the filmmaker, shot over years by friends
It traces a man who cannot communicate through his thoroughly authentic, REAL Brooklyn world
The people that you see are a step beyond even the stylization of the "mumblecore" movement
They are real people, painfully trapped in their own self-contained neuroses, unwilling to change, unable
The real world to them is their own set of delusions and because this is a film about people who are so profoundly out of touch, it is very difficult to watch
It is 16mm film-making without proper light, money or any of the other factors that would make a film "slick", but its honesty can not be understated, a fact that would cause a room full of people to dismiss it and for Richard Linklater to give it an award as he did at SXSW
This does remind of films like "Naked" or the best of the "mumblecore"
It is a film that is not for everyone, but one that challenges you to watch and grows on you the longer you think about it
This is the second movie based on the life and times of ultra hung porn star, John Curtis Estes, better known as John Holmes
Boogie Nights is also roughly based on his life
Maybe someday someone is going to do a movie on the life of Tommy Byron instead
<br /><br />The problem is, that the story is not very well told
There are many Law & Order episodes that have more twists and turns than Wonderland, and the director never gets the criminal case going with any kind of gusto
Val Kilmer has two problems - he is not nearly as hung as Holmes is (and no prosthesis this time around, unlike in Boogie Nights), and he is much better looking than mope Holmes
<br /><br />The director does not introduce one single likable individual among the cast
The racist, immature lowlifes he hangs out with, or his wife, and the police don't get much in the way of characterization
<br /><br />The best part of the movie is Eric Bogosian telling Paris Hilton to "get lost"
<br /><br />Having said all that, anyone interested in the sleaziest side of the porn business in the 1980s or true crime shouldn't miss it
I still cant get enough of watching some of his best stunts ever
I also like the bad guys in this movie (the old man looks like a Chinese version of John Howard)
Unlike some of Jackie's other work, this movie has also got a great story line and i recommend it to all of Jackie's fans
Mating Game is a charming, wonderful movie from an era gone by
Hollywood needs to consider a charming remake of this movie
<br /><br />It is an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and I watched on AMC
<br /><br />This movie has Tony Randall at his best
We plan on ordering on DVD to add to our growing collection of movies
<br /><br />Too bad Hollywood does not make movies like this anymore
time to dig some of these type of scripts out of the old safe, update them a bit (without spoiling the original movie and script as you have done with other remakes), and hold a casting call
<br /><br />A remake would be a big hit on the silver screen, DVD, and on cable/SATTV
The Night Listener held my attention, with Robin Williams shining as a New York City radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy (Rory Culkin) who is very ill
Williams has never met the boy in person, as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone
However, Williams' ex-boyfriend (nice job from Bobby Cannavale) raises doubt about the boy, which prompts Williams to arrange a meeting with him in person
What follows makes a permanent impact on Williams in a way he does not expect
<br /><br />I enjoyed this film, with Toni Collette giving a memorable portrayal of Culkin's adoptive mother
Sandra Oh also starred as Williams' friend
The Night Listener is inspired by actual events, and it has a somber, almost creepy silence throughout
At times it is predictable, no thanks to some of the reviews I read before seeing the movie and just due to logic, but I liked it anyway
I enjoy Williams in roles like this, more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me
As part of the quasi-conventionality of Steven Soderbergh's epic 4+ hour event, Che's two stories are told as classic "Rise" and "Fall" scenarios
In Part Two, Che Guevara, leaving his post as a bureaucrat in Cuba and after a failed attempt in the Congo (only in passing mentioned in the film), goes down to Bolivia to try and start up another through-the-jungle style revolution
Things don't go quite as well planned, at all, probably because of Che's then notorious stature as a Communist and revolutionary, and in part because of America's involvement on the side of the Bolivian Government, and, of course, that Castro wasn't really around as a back-up for Che
<br /><br />As it goes, the second part of Che is sadder, but in some ways wiser than the first part
Which makes sense, as Guevara has to endure low morale from his men, betrayals from those around him, constant mistakes by grunts and nearby peasants, and by ultimately the enclosing, larger military force
But what's sadder still is that Guevara, no matter what, won't give in
One may see this as an incredible strength or a fatal flaw- maybe both- but it's also clear how one starts to see Che, if not totally more fully rounded, then as something of a more sympathetic character
True, he did kill, and executed, and felt justified all the way
And yet it starts to work on the viewer in the sense of a primal level of pity; the sequence where Guevara's health worsens without medicine, leading up to the shocking stabbing of a horse, marks as one of the most memorable and satisfying of any film this year
<br /><br />Again, Soderbergh's command of narrative is strong, if, on occasion, slightly sluggish (understandable due to the big running time), and one or two scenes just feel totally odd (Matt Damon?), but these are minor liabilities
Going this time for the straight color camera approach, this is almost like a pure militia-style war picture, told with a great deal of care for the men in the group, as well as Guevara as the Lord-over this group, and how things dwindle down the final scene
And as always, Del-Toro is at the top of his game, in every scene, every beat knowing this guy so well- for better and for worse- that he comes about as close to embodiment as possible
Overall, the two parts of Che make up an impressive package: history as drama in compelling style, good for an audience even if they don't know Che or, better, if they don't think highly of him
The history of the FBI, as told from the point of view of Agent Stewart via flashbacks, interwoven with his personal life story
Stewart and Miles (as his wife) are pretty good, as is Hamilton as an earnest agent
The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved
It's like watching bits and pieces of a dozen different movies as we get glimpses of a who's who cast of gangsters
Some of the episodes are too long, some too short, and some just look out of place (Stewart's daughter's school sequence)
Nevertheless, it's worth a look for its handsome production values
Just beautiful, full of human emotion, wit, humour, intelligence
The story grows, as does the lesson of life, just a wonderful film in so many ways
a great selection of the finest British talent around
I loved them all for every diverse element brought into the film
<br /><br />Italy has to be one of the most romantic places to form a story such as this, - everything about this film works
I bought this cheap from the rental remnant at our local store
It was in almost mint condition, and I'd never heard of it before
You go through the whole realm of emotions and it attempts to get over a complex message - the very moral and non-triumphalist stance of the Mandela Party, undoubtedly
Despite its enormous length (I had to watch it in two sittings) - it was like a book one couldn't put down
Perhaps the songs are not all that memorable, but the spirit of the thing glows on forever
I cannot understand comments that a musical (clearly designed for stage) is not realistic! I've seen "South Pacific" and read the book too, and can guarantee that musical is not realistic compared to the book
I'll treasure this little find until it wears out
One day they'll make this again on a better budget
Great screenplay and some of the best actors the world has ever produced
Montand gives the concept of the 'lone wolf' police detective a whole new dimension of intensity and, most importantly, credibility
<br /><br />When a typical Hollywood cop-heroe loses family, friends and pets to murder he is usually given his minute of grief
But when the sixty seconds are over, he pulls himself together, packs his gun and goes gleefully shooting up his enemies one by one
<br /><br />Montand's Marc Ferrot, however, is really devastated - by his girlfriends murder, of course, but also by finding out that she had another lover
In his confusion and wrath he does not seek revenge but needs to keep going to find the real perpetrator of a crime where his fingerprints are all over the scene
Thus all his actions become unescapably logical
This is the main reason why this movie glues us to our seats but definetely not the only one
Most successful comic book movies usually depend on having villains that are bigger than life, ready to jump off the screen and strangle you alive with a smile or a demented line or two of dialog
The Tim Burton Batmans had it, as did (in an even more grotesque manner) Sin City
With Dick Tracy producer/director/star Warren Beatty piles on the villains until it becomes part of the framework
Like a boisterous homage to 1930s gangster pictures- only this time meant for kids as opposed to the darker Bonnie and Clyde- Dick Tracy is filled, joyfully, with archetypes and bright, primary colors, where the criminals carry tommy guns and are formed on their faces to shape their personalities
Villains like The Stooge, Shoulders, Lips, The Brow, Mumbles, the Blank, Pruneface, Spud
Chester Gould gave the names to his characters that fit their profiles, and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass
The film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously
<br /><br />If, at the time, movies like Batman and (underrated) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were darker depictions of reality within a comic-book outline, Dick Tracy is more 'old-school'
It's a story of cops and crooks, or rather A cop, detective Tracy as he tries to bust Big Boy (Al Pacino, in what is arguably his BIGGEST performance to date, and in a sense the one that makes sense for his grandiose style), but with no such luck
There's also a little kid, called simply the Kid (Charlie Korsmo, who somehow brings more spunk to this little kid than would've been imagined), and Tracy's love interest in Tess
And then there's the nightclub 'dame' (Madonna, who probably doesn't give any kind of great acting performance, but maybe that suits the role fine, and she sings excellently when called upon), who wont testify unless Tracy admits feelings he doesn't have for her
Then there's convoluted dealings with taking Tracy down, and a mysterious masked figure with a scraggly voice
<br /><br />Meantime, as if doing an impersonation of a Howard Hawks film in a splash of visual effects and bigger explosions, Dick Tracy adds on the wink-and-nod comedy and the action like its syrup on a tall stack of pancakes
It's a wonder to look at this world, which is created in ways that have a fascination to them that had they been done today would just be simply by proxy of computers (i
Sin City, which can be justifiably compared to Beatty's film)
We're driven through this world in great big shots and then thrust in the plot line, or whatever there is of it, in big editing montages with camera angles that seem to come out of those little tilted panels in the comics of old
I'm almost reminded of the Cotton Club during these sequences, as story, music, detail, and a few BIG punches and gun-shots go a long way to revealing what needs to be said, which, actually, isn't more than it needs to
And there's a heap-load of catchy dialog from the script (one of my favorites: "the enemy of my enemy is
my enemy", plus any of Pacino's references to other figures in quotes)
<br /><br />Revisiting this after seeing it for the first time in the movie theater (and only remembering little bits), Dick Tracy is a hard-boiled fantasy to the finest degree
It's filled with good cheer for the kids, and with some pretty good action squared away without some of the more sinister intent of its cousin comic-book movies (i
PG-13 fare), and for the adults its throw-back central done with panache and a solid feeling for the unsubtle
Even Dustin Hoffman hams it up, and he barely says an audible word
This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, are my favorite Pabst-directed films and I enjoyed them more than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks (such as PANDORA'S BOX)
It's probably because both are very similar to the Neo-Realist films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s
This style film called for using non-actors (just typical folks) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films
<br /><br />In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners, so appropriately, the people in the roles seem like miners--not actors
The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco-German border
Instead of one big mine, it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine, despite there being greater unemployment in Germany
This, language differences (illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene) and WWI conspire to create a huge rift between the factions--resulting in a WE vs
Later, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing
Risking their own lives, they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general
<br /><br />The film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried, in vain, to get the German audiences to see the futility of war and hatred
It was a gorgeously moving film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images I have ever seen
Considering history, though, the film's impact was minimal at best
It's a real shame, as like this one, WESTFRONT 1918, JÁACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestone) had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively swaying public opinion
So, from a historical point of view, it's an amazing and sad relic that is well worth seeing
I don't think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves
I love low budget horror movies and this takes the cake, especially for originality
Yes the Scarecrow is a Kung-Fu fighting frightner, but why not? No one else is willing to go that far
I really haven't had this much fun watching a movie since Candyman
So the town picks on this one kid calling him scarecrow, even his mom doesn't care about him
Then he gets killed and the spirit is infused with in the Scarecrow, who then goes on a Killing spree
His demise is relatively easy to assume once the movie gets going
The dedications at the end go straight to a bunch of horror directors, but with most dedication towards Dario Argento really struck me as cool, these folks who wanna make movies of a newer genre
Over the movie has a lot of Arnold rip offs, with one liners you'll definitely laugh at like stick around and he kills the sheriff with a stick
I would say, grab a pizza some friends an laugh your A$$ off with this movie
I had initially heard of TEARS OF KALI a while back and it sounded like something I'd be into, but with all the films I have coming in on a regular basis, it kinda fell off my radar
While roaming around the local WonderBook
I spotted the box for this one and grabbed it up
TEARS OF KALI is a strange, gory, sometimes downright creepy film which is somewhat constrained by it's obviously low budget - but is still an entertaining and worthwhile watch
<br /><br />TEARS OF KALI centers around the fictional India-based Taylor-Erikkson cult group, that practices meditation and other rituals in the pursuit of facing and banishing the individual's "inner demons" - but apparently these techniques work either all too well or not well enough (depending on your viewpoint
) as dark forces are not only exorcised, but also unleashed upon hapless victims
<br /><br />The film is told "anthology-style", with a short but memorable and "eye-opening" intro sequence, and then proceeding into the three stories that make up the bulk of the film
<br /><br />The first (SHAKTI) is about a journalist who visits one of the cult-members who is being held at a mental hospital
The journalist goes in under cover of wanting to research the Taylor-Erikkson cult, but we find that her true motives may hit a little closer to home
When the interview takes a violent turn, the journalist finds that she may have gotten in over her head
<br /><br />The second part (Devi) concerns a violent young man who is sentenced to psychological rehab in lieu of a prison sentence for beating a young man into a coma
We find that the treating doctor in question is actually a Taylor-Erikkson "alumni", and his rehabilitation methods are far from the norm
<br /><br />The closing story (KALI) revolves around a quack "faith-healer" and his assistant who perform "miracles" for a fee
When the healer unwittingly helps one of his clients and actually expels a force which had been possessing her, the demon is now free to roam and looking for a new host
<br /><br />I gotta say I really enjoyed TEARS OF KALI
There are some faults with the film that keep it from being truly excellent - but it is an original and ambitious film for what it is
My biggest gripe with the production is the poor and uninspired over-dubbed dialogue
The dubbing is sub-par and I would have much preferred to have a subtitled option with the original language track
Some reviewers have said the acting is poor, which I don't necessarily agree with
I think that the dubbing is so lack-luster that it makes the performances seem stunted, which isn't really the case
In fact, a few of the performances are pretty damn chilling (the "doctor" in the second segment, and the "client" in the third readily come to mind
The gore FX are very well done for a low-budget film, with some graphic scenes of eyelid-removal-via-cuticle-scissors, a pencil-in-the-throat-suicide, some decent (but irritatingly "shaky") self-flaying, and a few other goodies thrown in for good measure
Not as rough as some of the more "extreme" gore films out there, but definitely stronger than your average horror fare
I also found the story concerning the cult-group to be intriguing and a welcome change to the typical horror-story nonsense
There are plenty of scenes of genuine atmosphere and tension, the likes of which I haven't come across in a while
Although flawed in some fundamental ways, I still think TEARS OF KALI will appeal to most "underground" horror viewers - some scenes may prove too much for the more mainstream viewer
New York I Love You is full of love and power
Not for everybody, however, but is a beautiful movie
<br /><br />It has the likes of Shia LaBeouf (seen in Transformers, Disturbia, Charlies Angels, I Robot, Indiana Jones, and many more), Maggie Q, Kevin Bacon, Blake Lively, Natalie Portman, and many more
With a star-studded cast, this movie is without a doubt, brilliant
<br /><br />From many top-notch directors around the world, it does not fail to impress
The diversity from one story to another is creative and unique
<br /><br />It is safe to say that New York I Love You is a popcorn movie, and should be watched on a BIG TV! This time, trust the IMDb rating, because it is an excellent film
<br /><br />Eagerly waiting Shanghai I Love You in 2010
<br /><br />Watch NY ILY, you won't be disappointed
This episode apparently grew out of the cold war
There has been a holocaust but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson have come through unscathed
She is attracted to him and vice versa, but the instinct for survival takes over
It's a quiet, slow moving, chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust
They come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again
Of course, the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive
But it still is captivating and interesting
Because she doesn't speak, we don't know here mind very well, but in the end we can guess
(Question) What do you call 100 film critics buried up to their necks in sand? (Answer) A good start
Well, I don't know Peter Mattei from Adam but if he is the budding auteur his filmography suggests, "Love in the Time of Money" is a "good start"
A classy shoot with whimsical music box style music, this flick looks at a chain of tenuous relationships as it moves from person A to person B to person C
and back again ending with persons A & B in carousel fashion
The film gently probes the unhappy circumstances of nine people with finely rendered shadings beginning and ending with a street whore and her client
The downside of this film is the lack of a story which may have something to do with the many critical slams it received
I watched the behemoth "Angels in America" last night and was bored at the end while this little concatenation of character studies kept me spell bound
I may be the only person who really liked this flick
Who doesn't know of these two? There must be countless of fans who would die to make a film about them
Sandy Collora went ahead and put together a trailer for such a film(which does not exist, and is not being created, much less by this team)
Perhaps what this has most going for it is how polished it is
The production values, even with the costumes looking more like their comic counterparts than the ones of the feature films featuring these character, are quite high
The physical types fit for, as far as I can tell, every single character
The shots are well-thought up, nicely achieved and fairly effective
However, this does have problems, and in spite of looking good, it doesn't quite match the energy and skill of Grayson(which only had the problem of teeter-tottering too much back and forth between a short and a trailer, as well as unbridled passion leading to the inclusion of too many characters and ideas)
Even some of those who only have one line and/or hardly appear on-screen at all manage to fail at delivering a good performance
The actors cast in the parts seem to have been chosen more for how much they look like the characters they're playing than their talent
Really, the plot, well, what minuscule amount there is(this and this character team up, something about some evil plot
There is a problem in the characterization
While most characters seem to fit, Two-Face is, well, about as much as a cackling lunatic(which is quite simply, as far as I've understood, not what the character is) as he was in Batman Forever(and having your work on portraying any element of the Batman universe compared to Joel Schumacher's efforts can be considered the greatest insult to a fan)
Also, putting that character in this is going to cause comparisons between this trailer and that film(honestly, Collora is practically *begging* for it with such a similar initial reveal) to be made, and, let's face it, this loses in every respect
Michael Antonik most definitely does not possess the screen presence that Tommy Lee Jones does, and the make-up(which, in aforementioned reveal, is essential) isn't as strong as that of the film(whether or not it was good in the film is another matter)
The sad thing is that while Fiorella(John, who created Grayson) seems to be far more into the comics, and get them, the depth of them, better(not to mention possessing more of an ability to come up with compelling plot
Grayson had enough material for half a dozen feature films, or more), Collora seems to be the one with access to funds and the one who's more likely to have contacts(on account of having non-indie credits on his filmography) to actually have a shot at making an actual feature out of his trailer
I intend to watch other of Collora's work
But Fiorella is the one of the two whose work I will most definitely be most interested in
I recommend this to fans of the characters
I have just managed to get hold of the Celestial region 3 DVD of The Five Venoms and what a super job they have made of it
A fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must have for any Kung Fu fan
<br /><br />The story is pretty straight forward, and has been mentioned already so I won't go into it again
Needless to say it's the fight scenes that many buy the movie for, and they do not disappoint
Only problem is they are a bit few and far between and seem over rehearsed
Bruce Lee could take these lot on and drink a cup of tea at the same time! All kicks and punches come with the all important "type writer" clicks and air "whooshes", which is a cool effect though quite amusing!<br /><br />I give this movie a B+
In a way I feel it could have been that bit better
Golden Swallow, by the same director a decade earlier, had as good a story and better action
Y'know the part where Shadow falls down the ditch
thingy, I *cried*, considering I was only six, I cried! it takes a lot to make me cry! The dogs and the cat are excellently trained
A nice family movie, *not* for completely hardened non-fluffy people or animal-haters but could for soft-as-crap a
The plot:Kurt Harris (Jeff Wincott), a bitter, ex-cop goes undercover in the "Peacemakers" after his friend is killed by their leader
While there, he discovers that the woman wants to run for mayor, and will do anything to achieve this goal, even murder
The cast is good(Jeff Wincott is a good martial artist and good actor)
Brigitte Nielsen plays a sexy antagonist together another bad guy plays Matthias Hues also him good martial artist
The direction is good(the fight scenes also)
The rest is OK, with Tony Burton who plays a friend of Kurt killed from Nilsen,and Cyndi Pass plays a bad girl
From producers of another action/martial arts film(Bounty Tracker with Lorenzo Lamas)a good action film
I haven't seen anything this powerful and scintillating since Bruno Dumont's, "Twentynine Palms" (2003)
(By the way this film is not to be confused with another fairly recent pic about the topic of "female empowerment," "THE Descent" (2005), directed by our Splat Pack friend, Neil Marshall, who also happens to be a major talent his own right
) But getting back to this "Descent," the NC-17 rated (uh-oh) effort on which the lovely Ms
Dawson takes a producer's credit (congratulations) and directed by Talia Lugacy (strong chance that's not a real name), as good as it is (in moments), it will not be appreciated by most lay people out there because the script is pretty flawed
As a producer, you really have to tighten up that script
Of course, in the premise alone, you have the promise of rising conflict, but there still lies the task therein of accomplishing rising conflict
<br /><br />At times, this thing plays like an interesting piece of experimental theater and, well, I guess I'll let the others who've already commented here speak to the boringness of it, namely that which occurs in the second act -but find me a second act that isn't boring? There's also this Catch 22 that goes along with these quasi-independent films like "Descent" in which Rosario happens to be attaching herself to and leveraging her "fame-identity" to get a script into production that would, under usual circumstances, not get made at all while at the same time she is basically a miscast in the film's leading role
Rosario Dawson is gorgeous and, apparently, you can shoot this girl from just about any angle all day long, but, oh, wow-wee, how fast the time just slips away: Rosy ain't no undergraduate no more
That's part of the confusion about the screenplay: "Is she a graduate student? A TA? No, graduate students don't really have these type of qualms with football players, do they?" Again, if you are Rosario Dawson, Executive Producer, that's the one of many, many aspects to the professional film process you'll have to think about as you embark on this wonderful new role in your film career
And if you don't have the answer to why you're movie isn't convincing, let me tell you: there is a boatload and a bevy of vivacious, well-qualified, undergraduate aged talents, pining to get involved in the business, who might have nailed that lead character down, all the while, looking just as darn good as you know who; but unfortunately without Ms
I have to say, the camera department did an outstanding job, however, because this film is really well shot (i
The nightclub scenes look wonderful; one can tell all those music videos are starting to pay off and the play with time
The shooting/framing is all quite excellent which makes the picture a rewarding watch
However, I have a feeling, thanks to NetFlix, this movie will find a life of its own
If you're into experimental American film-making, cinematographic imagery of implausibly well formed college studs (or male model drop-outs) in their early twenties, or if you're an undergraduate, just plain angry at the hormonally aggressive young men that comprise less than half of your American university, "Rosario Dawson's Descent" might be your flavor of RockaRoll
If you like adult comedy cartoons, like South Park, then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at Bromwell High
Keisha, Natella and Latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches, I think Keisha is a good leader
There are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school
Bip, the nervous Maths teacher and many others
The cast is also fantastic, Lenny Henry's Gina Yashere, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack The Pony's Doon Mackichan, Dead Ringers' Mark Perry and Blunder's Nina Conti
I didn't know this came from Canada, but it is very good
A bit quirky and bordering bad taste; but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching
A wheelchair-bound young woman Jane Hatchard(Helena Bonham Carter)is teamed with a reluctant caregiver, Richard(Kenneth Branagh)
Richard is an artist that daydreams of human flight
He builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it
He wants to resurrect his own troubled life by taking care of the independent, dying Jane, who suffers from an neurological disease that has all but left her speechless and very little motor skills
Wheelchair-bound and full of spirit, her last dying wish is to loose her virginity
She offers herself to Richard, who won't help her directly; but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed
I found this flick ambitious and humorous
Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and likability
Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most compelling thrillers I have ever seen
The story concerns bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as he is lured into a relationship with beautiful hairdresser Christine (Renée Soutendijk), but in the twisted mind of Gerard there could be more to the story
Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and sickening sexual imagery, this really pulls you into the story, you don't want to watch, but you can't turn yourself away
This is by far Verhoeven's best film (maybe second only to Robocop)
True The Fourth Man isn't for everyone, some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous (just ignore them, but trust me, if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be hooked
This is one of those films that you need to know how it ends, a true whodunit it in the Hitchcock tradition, compelling, controversial and thrilling
Most people, especially young people, may not understand this film
It looks like a story of loss, when it is actually a story about being alone
Some people may never feel loneliness at this level
<br /><br />Cheadles character Johnson reflected the total opposite of Sandlers character Fineman
Where Johnson felt trapped by his blessings, Fineman was trying to forget his life in the same perspective
Jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and Sandler pulls tears
Cheadle had the comic role and was a great supporter for Sandler
If you have ever lost and felt alone, this film will assure you that you're not alone
LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first film I saw in 2000 and I doubt I'll see a better one this year
This beautiful tragicomedy by Belgian filmmaker Benoît Mariage is set in the industrial wastelands of Wallonia
Benoît Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car (a Lada!) for him
To do this the son has to break the record opening doors
What the father actually wants his for his son to be someone, because he himself has never made it further as the reporter of local news for a newspaper ironically called L'Espoir (Hope)
This film can best be compared to Aki Kaurismäki's DRIFTING CLOUDS, although it is more dramatic and the humour is darker
Just like in that film however the tone is more melancholic than depressing and the ending upbeat, without being unrealistically happy
The humour is absurd, without making the plot unbelievable, and Mariage finds stunning images in the bleak settings that never seem artificial
The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the acting by Poelvoorde
This actor shot to fame with the also brilliant cult-classic C'EST ARRIVÉ PRÈS DE CHEZ VOUS in which he played the charismatic hitman Ben
Since then he only played two small roles in films that were not released in the Netherlands, because, as he said in an interview, he was not convinced of his own acting capabilities and all the roles he was offered were reprises of the Ben character
With his return to a leading role in LCA there should be no doubt anymore about his acting
He's simply brilliant as a man stupid and evil enough to put his family in misery, but smart enough to realize what he's done and be torn by remorse about it
In all honesty, this series is as much a classic (as television goes) as the original poem is to the world's literature
Far from being crassly exploitative, it is a beautiful and respectful rendering of one of the western culture's defining texts
<br /><br />I was moved by the plight of Odysseus and his followers; touched by the drama of the fall of Troy (which was felt but not seen); intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals
(It should be mentioned that the gods appearing here are not ridiculous CGI creatures flitting around on their ankle wings, or poorly-cast fashion models in bikinis
As in Homer's work, they act through mortal agents or, rarely, are represented by classical statuary)
<br /><br />It's a pity it's not available in DVD, especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the Odyssey that one can find in video stores
This is one movie that will take time to get out of your head once you have seen it
The dialogs are close to perfect, which was to be expected as it has been adapted from a play
The actors are simply giving their best, the story is simple and attractive
88 minutes of pure bliss!<br /><br />Yvan Attal is totally credible in his role, Sandrine Kiberlain is still the beautiful blonde (but not so dumb) providing as much pleasure to the eyes as to the ears, Jean-Paul Rouve is providing an excellent approximation of the total jerk (and proud to be such), and Marina Fois is the dumb friend who is always blundering when you expect it least
<br /><br />Thumbs up to Bernard Rapp and associates for adapting this excellent play, and all the best for future productions!<br /><br />I wish there were more of these in nowadays production
If you liked it, you will also probably enjoy: "Un air de famille", and "Cuisine et dependances"
Both were written and played by the couple Bacri/Jaoui
After going for a bike ride that day, lying beside a lake in a nature reserve, spending half an hour feeding and talking to a donkey who lived in a beautiful field with a small wood in it, this film made absolute sense to me
<br /><br />The imagery of the film was beautiful and that is all you need
Switch off the conscious control knob of the mind and job done
<br /><br />Reminded me of Baraka (1992) but with the added lesson of my previous paragraph
<br /><br />This comment requires a minimum of ten lines, ten lines is the minimum not 9 lines but ten
After finishing counting all the lines you realise that there are less than ten even though less than ten lines is all that is needed to make my comment
For a low budget movie this was really good
I put this well above your average action B-movie
Sean and Corinne delivered in this movie, and they didn't seem camera shy
Watch out for the cameos of Jeanne and Jared
I didn't think that the producers would even consider that, but the runner-ups deserve that much
<br /><br />I'll be looking forward to more of Sean and Corinne's involvement in the movie entertainment industry
Sean's character seemed very genuine, and sexy Corinne's character was pretty hard-nosed and on point
She connected well with the action sequences and executed with confidence
It was a great idea to cast Billy Zane as the smart and witty villain
His charisma on screen is always a pleasure to watch
The chemistry between Zane and Sean's character was pretty good
The action sequences weren't cheesy and seemed to connect throughout the movie
Of course there were flaws, but that comes with the territory
<br /><br />Overall, this was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was made for TV
Sean and Corinne did a good job considering that they are newcomers to the game
I hope that Jeanne, Jared, and the rest of the Next Action Star cast get their chance to also join their co-stars in entertainment success
The Running Man is often dismissed as being just another Arnie action thriller full of explosions, bad puns and gunfire, and to be fair, there is a lot of that in it
People used to look at it and compare it to the Terminator series, saying it was one of the poorer Schwarzenegger films
<br /><br />But, give it 18 years, and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light
Rather than just being another brainless action film, it works very well as a parody of reality TV
It is quite different to the Stephen King book, true, but I doubt whether Hollywood, with its love of upbeat endings and so-called 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando, would have accepted it in its current form
<br /><br />Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cop working in a dystopian United States where democracy is a thing of the past, and the entire country is ruled by a government/media conglomerate amalgamation
The economy is in tatters, food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch, like Jumping for Dollars, where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs, and the most popular one is The Running Man, a gameshow hosted by the slimy Damian Killian (played by the entertaining Richard Dawson) where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical, pro-wresting-esquire 'stalkers'
<br /><br />Some, however, try and speak up against the government
When a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of Bakersfield, California, a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to 'calm' (i
When Richards refuses to fire on innocent people, he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd
He is sentenced to a slave labour camp, but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and goes on the run
<br /><br />However, his freedom does not last long, and after he kidnaps network employee Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso) in an attempt to escape those pursuing him, he finds himself taken prisoner again, but this time he is forced to appear on The Running Man
<br /><br />And there, of course, the entire film kicks into standard Arnie mode
Richards is launched into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles (why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) and forced to run from the 'stalkers', along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him
Amber also becomes curious about Richards' protestations of innocence, and discovers he was framed
Guess what happens to her, then? So, as Amber, Richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers, we soon become aware that Richards is no ordinary cop
He's Super Arnie, the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in Christmas lights all while being just your average American guy with an Austrian accent
<br /><br />Yes, the remainder of the film becomes dumb, loud, classic 80's Arnie fun
There's a lot of exciting fight sequences, the trademark dreadful puns ('He had to split' being my favourite), and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending
It's a lot of fun watching Killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way, as well, and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host (watch out for the cursing old lady!) and the cold, cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings
<br /><br />If you expect a high-brow, intelligent film, you'll be disappointed
But if you want a great 80s flick, well, this is it
But the great thing about this film is it was quite prophetic
<br /><br />If you look at the entertainment we have today, you'll have noticed the way reality TV is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame, and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on TV
It's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile TV exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on TV
We've already had that, however, with the ghoulish al-Qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet
It seems that in the current climate, at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets
<br /><br />With that in mind, and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s, you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film
Of course, we haven't reached there yet, as it's terrorists, rather than the mainstream media, who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death, but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity
(spoilers?)<br /><br />while the historical accuracy might be questionable
(and with the mass appeal of the inaccurate LOTR
such things are more easily excused now) I liked the art ness of it
It does provide a little emotionally charged scenes from time to time
The voice you hear whispering from time to time is not explained
<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replayable: 5/1
This is such a great movie to watch with young children
I'm always looking for an excuse to watch it over & over
Gena was good, Cheech was fun,the Russian was good, Maria was adorable & of course Paulie was the best
Have just seen the Australian premiere of Shower [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival
The program notes said it was - A perfect delight -deftly made, touching, amusing, dramatic and poignantly meaningful
I just hope the rest of the Festival films come up to this standard of entertainment and I look forward to seeing more Chinese films planned to be shown in Sydney in the coming months
**Warning! Spoilers Ahead!**<br /><br />This short is part one of two that expound upon the brief portion of "The Matrix" in which Morpheus explains how the matrix came to be
Because we already know the story, the plot itself is no surprise; and the short isn't so much entertaining as informative
But that's how it is presented, as a file in the historical archives
The visuals are better than average, and the generally cold colors aid the purpose of the short
The violence of the tale is a little gratuitous and, combined with the occasional dose of political correctness (UN scenes), detracts from the straight narrative of the short
Plus it needs to be seen with part two to be complete
<br /><br />The Animatrix concept is brilliant, and despite a few issues, this short still fulfills its purpose
It would not have fit in the original movie in style, content, or flow
This is the perfect method to reveal the history
<br /><br />Bottom Line: Good information
Could have been told a little better, but still a solid 7 of 10
Something about the 40 Year Old Virgin and the other comedy hit of the summer, Wedding Crashers, is similar, but they are two different films in some respects
Both are romantic comedies that have that kind of over-the-top, crazy sensibility that keeps the teens and guys in their 20's along with the usual dating crowd to go see the films
Both have some sort of formula to the stories as well
But by the end of the 40 Year Old Virgin, I think I found overall it was more satisfying than 'Crashers'
Although one can guess where the relationship story with Steve Carrell's character Andy and Catherine Keener's character Trish will go to, it isn't too basic for one to figure out like with Crashers, and the characters both leading and supporting are realistic, more rounded than most of the one-dimensional or unexplained people in the other
And, perhaps, it may also depend on how much you identify (or just find the lunacy) in both
<br /><br />The thing is some people may go into The 40 Year Old Virgin not knowing Steve Carrell as well as Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn, as Carrell has built up his cult status on The Daily Show (one of my favorite shows on now) and in small but unforgettably riotous roles in Anchorman and Bruce Almighty
This is his first starring role, but it's not treated like some third rate vehicle
He and co-writer/director Judd Apatow treat the character of Andy with a certain level of sincerity that keeps the audience on his side all the way, even early on as he talks to his action figures while re-painting them
It's also a tricky line to walk on- in lessor hands this could be no more or less entertaining than the Lackluster 40 Days and 40 Nights with Josh Hartnett (also about sexual dysfunction)
As the title suggests, Andy is the 40 year old who is like the nice guy friend with still a little Pee-Wee Herman in him (the opening over the credits of his his apartment is hilarious, a good sign)
<br /><br />So, his friends (among them Paul Rudd, Romany Mancoy, Seth Rogen, all very good comic foils) try and devise different strategies and tips to finally break the sort of curse over Andy's head to pop his cherry, so to speak
He almost gets with a overly drunk woman, he almost gets with a freaky kind of girl, and almost with his own boss (Jane Lynch, also very funny in the mockumentaries) as a (explitive) buddy
But this soon all starts to fade as he gets into a meaningful relationship with Trish, who works across the street from him
As they build on a relationship not based at all on sex, one might worry that the plot gear of "how is he going to tell her such and such" might get in the way of the comedy
In fact, if anything, Carrell and the cast build on it to a very high degree
For practically an hour and a half of the film's two hour length, there was barely a moment I wasn't laughing, whether big or small
<br /><br />The big laughs though make up for not just any kind of formalities with the plot, or one or two little stray stories (the fellow co-workers have their own relationship problems as well, Rudd's being the funniest)
The big laughs come through because of Carrell's reactions, and that the people around him can either back up with their own sort of humor/charm, or that its with some truth
Keener gives a very good performance and makes it so that there is a genuine spirit to their relationship (and, un-like 'Crashers', there isn't as much that doesn't make sense character wise)
For someone like me who loves it when a comedian can get laughs just from the way he looks on his face, Carrell gets very high points here
And like with a Farrelly brothers movie, the more raunchy or outrageous scenes are done with total absurdity; the 'waxing' scene (which was done for real, by the way) and the sort of Aquarius musical number towards the very end of the film (the way it comes out at first is a total, uproarious surprise)
But if you're willing not to get offended by it, there's more where that came from
This is one of the funniest films of the year
Pop quiz: you're a part of the modern armed forces in peacetime on routine manoeuvres and you find yourself thrown back in time with a chance to change history
What do you do? Well, if you're a Hollywood studio, you change the Japanese G
Samurai (aka Timeslip) to the crew of an American aircraft carrier, have them debate stopping the attack on Pearl Harbour for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no-one reminds you that Japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this Sonny Chiba movie
But unlike its Hollywood counterpart The Final Countdown, this sees its premise through: thrown back 400 years into the Japanese feudal wars, its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history by trying to change it by joining with a warlord to conquer the country  cue lots of tank and helicopter vs
samurai action, including a very impressive unrelenting 25 minute battle sequence featuring a cast of thousands inflicting serious damage on each other
<br /><br />Of course, things don't go as planned, and even superior firepower doesn't stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers
Even before that, the soldiers are falling out with each other into those who want to go home, those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and pillage for the Hell of it
Impressively directed and surprisingly well thought through, the soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction, especially when they feature English lyrics sung by Japanese singers who audibly can't pronounce the words let alone speak the language, but it's a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci-fi actioner
<br /><br />Optimum's UK DVD is a good transfer of the uncut 138-minute version
"Ko to tamo peva" is one of the best films I ever saw
A tragicomedy with very deep implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a God-forsaken Serbian province just before the start of the World War II
I saw it in a small movie theater in Russia where the film had had a very limited distribution, and I had no chance to come across it ever since
It is such a pity that this excellent film is almost forgotten now
I searched for a VHS or DVD copy of it many times, and alas - could find none
I would be most grateful to other fans of this little gem of movie-making for a suggestion of the ways to purchase a copy
Since the advent of literature, people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love
Even more fascinating have always been the tales of impossible love, love that cannot be
The Israeli filmmaker Eytan Fox' latest film The Bubble" is about that
The title of the film refers to the bubble" that is Tel-Aviv set against the background of the political realities of Israel
The country's cosmopolitan and unofficial capital city doesn't have much in common with Nablus, a city in the Palestinian West Bank which also features in the film
It doesn't have much in common with the tense and hateful atmosphere at the Palestinian checkpoints
Actually, it doesn't seem to have much in common with anything surrounding it
The bubble" of Tel-Aviv allows people to have a lifestyle which isn't much different from what you may expect in any Western city
Teenage girls looking for Britney Spears' records, a lifestyle magazine editor looking for a sexy cover for his next issue, trendy people sitting in trendy cafes discussing trendy things over cups of cappuccino and other similarly trendy drinks, while those at home are watching the local edition of Pop Idol
It is this bubble" that also has the potential to lull one's mind into a false sense of reality
<br /><br />The film evolves around the lives of three young Israelis who share a flat and, for the most part, try to stay out of politics
Yelli, the camp owner and manager of Orna & Ella", a hip cafe, rarely leaves the city and prefers not to think about the crap that surrounds them"
Noam, a soft and easygoing employee of a slightly avantguard record store, seems to be equally unwilling to engage in long political discussions and contemplations
Lulu, the only female of the lot, is on the contrary linked to the Israeli Left, although her political activities seem to be confined to raves against the occupation"
Yelli and Noam naturally don't object to participating in these
Lulu and her political friends make t-shirts with the rave's logo, put up posters and hand out booklets advertising it in the neighbourhood
Their main concern seems to be that there are never any actual Palestinians participating and that the police might come and spoil all the fun for them again
The closest they come to an actual confrontation is when they get into a scuffle with some not so Palestinian-friendly locals who try to prevent them from handing out the leaflets
In other words, predictable products of the bubble"
<br /><br />The opening scenes of the film take us to a checkpoint on a road to Nablus where we also find Noam doing his reserve duty
A group of Palestinians is being thoroughly checked before entering Israel, among them a pregnant woman who suddenly goes into labour and gives birth to a stillborn child despite the best efforts from Noam and the doctor who eventually arrives in an ambulance
The woman is comforted by a young man who later turns up on Noam's doorstep in Tel-Aviv with his ID which the latter obviously dropped during the ordeal on the border
His name is Ashraf, he's Palestinian and he's gay
And he hasn't just come to hand back the ID, he has come to see Noam
Without a permit to live in Israel and despite the initial hesitation from Noam's flatmates he stays
He soon gets a Jewish name and a job at Yelli's cafe
Having grown up in Jerusalem with Hebrew, he doesn't have an Arabic accent which makes it possible for him and his newly found friends to conceal his identity
The sky is light blue and the air is sweet
For he has become part of an equation which was never meant to be
<br /><br />At one point, Noam and Ashraf watch a play called Bent about two prisoners in a Nazi concentration camp who have a love relationship which can never become physical or visible to the surrounding guards
They find a way of being together on another level, a metaphysical one, a level where no one else has access
This is also where our couple arrives in the end
And it couldn't have been much different for them, not in today's Israel
<br /><br />The Bubble" is a political statement about the bubble that bursts when confronted with the political realities of today's Israel set against the background of a beautiful and awkward love story involving an Israeli and a Palestinian, the impossible love story in a divided world where no such things as compromise or other colours than black and white exist
The Bubble" is also a beautiful film about people, gay and straight, inhabiting that strange city, Tel-Aviv, shown through the eyes of people who really care about them
The film's premise may have its flaws and the fatal chain of events may seem somewhat construed, but its strong message and emotional impact will not leave you untouched
One of the most beautiful movies ever made in ex Yu
Story is very familiar to people in ex Yul because generation after war used to live in the same way
People in the west cant imagine how political situation in our country affect people
The plot is in the 50",When Josip Broz Tito said no to the SSSR and politbiro and because of that our borders becomes open for western influence
But,in a country were people didn't had much money jeans was only ideal and friendship was everything
The friendship between for young people an a girl was so strong that after 40 years of their emigration from Yu is still alive
They get together after all this years on Ester"s funeral and they start to remember of their childhood,before their went to the emigration and become successful people
Robin Williams does his best to combine comedy and pathos, but comes off a bit shrill
Donald Moffat is too one-note as his father-in-law
Jeff Bridges is excellent though as the quarterback, and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are marvelous, carrying the film through most of its rough spots
It fills time nicely, but is little more than that
I can't tell you all how much I love this movie
I have read reviews that say that this move is "too confusing" or "like swimming in drying concrete"
I say that these reviewers have no imagination! For anyone who loves Fantasy Fiction, this movie is for you
If you ever loved playing Dungeons & Dragons
this movie is for you, (especially if you got into the Oriental Adventures) I'm just sorry that I did not get to see this movie on the big screen
(Just more incentive to get my own big screen t
After a chance encounter on the train, a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of Vienna, discussing life and love
The primary reason to see "Before Sunrise," is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines
As "Celine," this sexy, brainy, soulful brown-eyed blond is sort of a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Joni Mitchell as they were in their mid-twenties
Risking overstatement, Celine is practically the ideal woman, unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural, unpretentious, introspective, and selflessly loving
We can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak, for her sincere, intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating
Further, her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks English with a French accent that is very endearing
<br /><br />If there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie, it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar
Ethan Hawke as "Jessie" comes off like a vaguely appealing slob, sort of a Maynard G
Attempting to appear detached and nonchalant, he sort of drags himself through certain shots
His pants fit poorly, his tee shirt is coming untucked, his wavy dark hair (his most attractive feature) needs a good washing, and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee
Nevertheless, he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two-week train ride around Europe, so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine
His oft-cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic Celine, although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation
When he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence, we know he is getting somewhere
<br /><br />After blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes, bars, and silly diversions, they agree that because they may never see one another again, they should make the most of it
Jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass, looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up
<br /><br />Given his boundless luck in the romance department, it is especially irksome when Jessie, as the very definition of a naive jerk, foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp
He contents himself with a half-baked plan, quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu, to reunite at the same spot in half a year
When the appointed time comes, you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another, perhaps even married and pregnant
For whatever reason, she probably won't show, while Jesse, who ends up working at Target or (if he's lucky) the local library, will go back to Vienna, desperate to see her again, only to wind up alone
<br /><br />Despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion, "Before Sunrise" is a beautiful movie
I highly recommend both it and the sequel, "Before Sunset
<br /><br />Let us assume that the narration is more than a spoof, let us assume it is a commentary on Japanese society
And as this film is as fast paced an absurdist documentary as they come, the constant wordplay, as fast is it goes, and as poorly translated as it is-- in its current festival screener version as seen tonight at the Copenhagen Cinematek-- It is still quite enjoyable
<br /><br />But for the patient, and ONLY the truly patient and open-minded, I'm talking to you Jim Jarmusch fans with ADD relapses, I believe this is a film for you
It's an intelligent film if you allow it to win you over
<br /><br />Quite beautiful, and quite kitsch, and quite Japanese sub-culture
All in all, Fun for those that want to see a Japanese film that spoofs Japanese food culture
A thumbs up if you're in the mood for something completely different
I have not read the novel, though I understand that this is somewhat different from it; the fact that I rather enjoyed this, coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre, leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book
Having not read a single word of Austen's writing, I really can't compare this to any of her work
What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever, witty, and well-delivered, as well as the biggest source of comedy in this
This made me laugh out loud a lot, with perfect British and verbal material
Every acting performance is spot-on, and Paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker
The characters are well-written, credible and consistent
I did find a couple of them extremely irritating, however, and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't amusing the first time they appeared
The editing and cinematography are marvelous, and everything looks utterly gorgeous
Plot and pacing are great, you're never bored
It does end in a *really* obvious manner, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer
I can't claim that this did not entertain me, it did from start to finish, and I'd watch it again
I recommend this to any fan of romance stories
While movie titles contains the word 'Mother', the first thing that comes to our mind will be a mother's love for her children
<br /><br />However, The Mother tells a different story
<br /><br />The Mother do not discuss the love between a mother and her child, or how she sacrifice herself for the benefit of her child
Here, Notting Hill director Roger Michell tells us how a mother's love for a man about half of her age hurts the people around her
<br /><br />Before Daniel Craig takes on the role of James Bond, here, he plays Darren, a man who is helping to renovate the house of the son of the mother, and sleeping with her daughter as well
Anne Reid, who was a familiar face on TV series, takes up the challenging role of the leading character, May
<br /><br />The story begins with May coping with the sudden loss of her husband, Toots, in a family visit to her son, Bobby
While she befriends Darren, a handyman who is doing some renovation in Bobby's house, she was shocked to found out that her daughter, Paula, was sleeping with Darren
At the same time, May was coping with life after the death of Toots
Fearing that Harry and Paula do not wanted her, May starts to find her life going off track, until she spends her afternoon with Darren
<br /><br />Darren was nice and friendly to May, and May soon finds some affection on Darren
Instead of treating him like a friend, she treated the man who was about half her age with love of a couple
Later, May found sexual pleasure from Darren, where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else
And this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the break down of a family
<br /><br />The Mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life, and solace on someone who is there for her to shoulder on
This can be told from May buying tea time snacks for Darren to fulfilling sexual needs from a man younger than her, where it eventually gave her more than she bargained for
<br /><br />Anne Reid has made a breakthrough for her role of May, as she was previously best well known for her various role on TV series
As she do not have much movies in her career resume, The Mother has put her on the critic's attention
Daniel Craig, on the other hand, had took on a similar role in his movie career, such as Sylvia (2003) and Enduring Love (2004)
If his reprising role of James Bond fails, film reviewers should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions in his years of movie career, and The Mother is one of them
<br /><br />The Mother may not be everyone's favorite, but it is definitely not your usual matinée show to go along with tea and scones, accompanied by butter and jam
i've just read the most recent remarks about this movie and i would like to respond

<br /><br />further more this movie was a 90 minute laughing spree, the way they explained the bootie juice song to be a political statement was hilarious
not to mention the "love song" tasty was hooking up
and when vanilla sherbert got his ass kicked, just like the record company executive is also hilarious and having they're managers getting shot every time too
<br /><br />people who didn't enjoy this movie probably didn't get it or were complete idiots, my opinio
I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival, where it received a standing ovation! This film tells a story that to my knowledge has never been told before--namely about the Rosenstrasse (a street in Berlin)uprising of German gentile women who were married to Jews at the end of the Second World War
As such, it is a unique story, and what's more, is the only film about the Holocaust that I have ever seen that shows that there were GOOD Germans (the helping family in "Anne Frank" for instance was Dutch) who did NOT support the Nazis, and, in fact, had the fortitude to stand up against their own country's immorality and brutality during the Nazi regime, at the risk of their very lives
The acting is great across the board, the framing story in New York interesting and intricate, the direction from Von Trotta masterful in every scene, and the production values, including the gorgeous cinematography, outstanding
Of course the family in New York could be speaking German
Many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native tongue with their family--a common occurrence
The film is long, but I did not look at my watch once
I am hoping this film gets some distribution is North America, for not only is this film a masterpiece, but it can actually help heal any animosity people have towards the Germans because of their support of Hitler
If this film is playing in your area, I URGE YOU TO SEE IT! You will be glad you did
This is pure girl FUN with the most fantastic cast of female leads
Like someone else here said, this is the film Baby Mama was meant to be
And the only downside I see to this film is that Tina Fey was not in it- besides that it stars the smartest and brightest girls on the planet
The film is pure silliness on the surface, but if you really watch you will know it has a lot of messages and deep meaning to any of us who wish they could go back and do it all over again in life knowing then what we know now
PURE FUN and I recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape
They're all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fast
<br /><br />These series however, are well played, the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one, the story will still be catching your mind
<br /><br />The episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital
(Some spoilers) I have not read the James M
Cain novel (`The Postman Always Rings Twice') on which this movie was based, so I cannot compare this film version to it, but I have seen and love the 1946 US version (also entitled `Postman')
<br /><br />Even better is this gem from Italy, which, I have read, was `mutilated' in editing because of too many blatant references to the Fascist regime
Well, no matter  what is left is a fine piece of cinema, apparently the forerunner of the neo-realist movement in film-making
One can certainly see why  despite whatever harsh editing did go on, a pervading sense of societal and cultural, as well as personal oppression remains, hanging heavy over the protagonists, who therefore face many limits in life
<br /><br />Consider Gino, the young drifter, not well educated, unemployed, and resorting to stowing away, stealing and conning people in order to get by, his one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually useless
<br /><br />In Giovanna, he sees a way out, yet he should have kept going, as Giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money, her job (working at the trattoria for her husband, slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen), and her sex
In the past, she had limited options, and decided to marry the restaurant/gas station owner (Giuseppe Bregana, played by Juan de Landa) anyway, knowing that he would not make her happy
She tells Gino that she feels sick every time Bregana touches her
<br /><br />On the pretext of helping Bregana fix his car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part (which he has in fact pocketed), Gino wins Bregana's favor (promising also to fix the broken water pump  water symbolizing life, or lack thereof) and is left alone with Giovanna
They immediately start a heated, passionate, yet volatile love affair
<br /><br />Gino soon feels stifled by the relationship, and feels the need to move on again when Giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband
Wanting no part of it, Gino leaves town on a train ride that he cannot afford, kindly paid for him by another gypsy-type man named Spagnolo, a fellow train passenger
To Gino, Spagnolo represents a sort of freedom, and they become friends (Spagnolo also symbolizes Gino's morality and conscience), traveling and finding work at a carnival together
To his dismay (he is not yet over his love for Giovanna), a month has passed when Bregana and his wife go to the carnival and Bregana persuades Gino to go `back home' to live and work with them again, as he is handy to have around
<br /><br />Too weak-willed to resist, knowing this will reunite he and Giovanna, Gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple
After a while he gives in to Gina's demands to get rid of her husband
Once the evil deed is done, Giovanna becomes more cold-blooded than ever, seeming to have very little conscience, while guilt and shame eat away at Gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm
As much as he wants to leave her  he does again briefly, they are now inextricably linked, and must face the consequences
<br /><br />I liked the way the Spagnolo character came back into Gino's life to act as a judge of his misdeeds  that was very good, and interesting, adding another dimension to the story
version with Lana Turner and John Garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters, especially the cops and the lawyers, Ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone
This gives the final outcome even more potency, and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live
<br /><br />A minor quibble: The amount of time (hardly any) that elapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers, how quickly they kill the husband (there is no botched first attempt as in the U
version); Gino's very quick-to-escalate relationship with the dancer/hooker  they quickly profess their love as well, and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met!  all rather unrealistic, isn't it? I found this time-frame problem quite distracting  it made me think that I must have missed something somewhere
The acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout
This is a very grim, hard hitting, even brutal film about a death row break that goes awry
It's black and white photography keeps it from being dated
Mickey Rooney is excellent as the twisted, yet strangely sympathetic lead
One of the first movies to portray the psychological desolation of death row
The film's design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country (U
We see relationships all over at the university setting for the film
But what the film adds to its value is its other relationships: male v
But most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v
<br /><br />I was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus
Most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other
This film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides
It did not attempt to show how either was right, although I would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive (quite obvious towards the end)
It is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together, for a time
Lawrence Fishburne does an over-the-top performance as the sagacious Profesor Phipps
He crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down-trodden with the industrious and positive
Other stars that make this film are Omar Epps, Ice Cube, and Jennifer Connelly
Michael Rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance
Tyra Banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act
<br /><br />Higher Learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper
In fact, I would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other, rather than some dry book, as the real education at a university
It is a life-learning process, not a textual one
I think you'll find "Higher Learning" is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general
Galaxy Express 999 (Ginga tetsudô Three-Nine)
Based on the original work by Leiji Matsumoto
<br /><br />What little I know of the history of GALAXY EXPRESS 999, it was first published as a popular manga in 1970's and was created by Leiji Matsumoto
GE999 is set in the same Star Wars-type of space universe as Matsumoto's other famous space manga: CAPTAIN HARLOCK
In fact space pirate Harlock and other characters from that manga (including Queen Emeraldas and Tochirô Oyama) make appearances in GE999
GE999 was a success as a manga and was soon followed by also popular anime series which included over 100 episodes
A year later came this anime film, which isn't a sequel to the series, but summaries the main points of the story in two hours long movie
<br /><br />The story is set in unidentified Star Wars-type of future where journeying to different planets has become a possibility
People of the future can have themselves mechanical bodies in which they can live hundreds of years, maybe even forever
The protagonist, Tetsurô Hoshino, is a young boy who witnesses how a cruel Count Mecha, whose entire body is made of mechanical parts, kills Tetsurô's mother
Tetsurô swears revenge and is convinced that he can only achieve it by having a mechanical body
To obtain it he must travel to a far-away planet with space train Galaxy Express 999
However, since Tetsurô comes from poverty, he has no money to obtain the expensive ticket
By a chance coincidence he meets a beautiful young woman, Maetel, who bears a resemblance to his dead mother
Maetel offers a ticket for Tetsurô on a condition that she accompanies him on his journey
And so the journey begins<br /><br />I first saw this film last October, about six months from now, and again yesterday
I feel that I must first tell about the thing that bothered me the most in this film: it seems very rushed
Then again what can you expect from 2 hours long movie that tries to tell the main points of over 100 episodes long series? Whatever the case, the situations change with a fast speed and Tetsurô meets other important characters in the story mostly by pure chance
I feel makers should have either left something out or include extra 30 minutes
<br /><br />However, there's no arguing that GE999 has deserved its place as an anime classic
The animation itself, very faithful to the style of Matsumoto's manga, is detailed and beautiful to watch
Even after almost 30 years of its release the animation has not become "out of date" but puts many later anime films in shame
The music through out the film is enjoyable to listen even if somewhat "old" these day (it was the 70's after all)
I have not heard any English dub of this film so I can only comment the Japanese audio which is good
Voice actors give life to their characters, most memorable ones being Masako Nozawa (mainly known as the voice of Goku through out the entire Dragon Ball saga) as the excited and young Tetsurô, and Masako Ikeda as the calm and mysterious Maetel
The supporting characters are not left in shadows, but also have a life of their own, most memorable to me being waitress Claire
<br /><br />The story itself is suitable for both those who are looking for an entertainment for couple of hours, as well as for those who try to find deeper messages
GE999 is an entertaining adventure film but can also be seen as Tetsurô's journey from boyhood to manhood
The whole film is told from his point of view, so we are forced to feel what he feels
I think many people can relate to Tetsurô, for despite the fantasy elements, he is a very realistic character: young, hot headed, awkward and naive
We follow him as he starts to see differences between humans and machines and come to conclusion whether he wants the mechanical body or not
Maetel on the other hand stays as a mystery in the film and even in the end, when she reveals who and what she really is, it doesn't much answer to anything
Maetel can be seen as a dream of a growing young man, always close but just out of reach
<br /><br />It's is the strange yet beautiful relationship between Tetsurô and Maetel that still awakes talking and questions, and fascinates after the decades
People have argued if their relationship is that of a two friends, of mother and son, or of two possible lovers (which wakes a lot of critique since Maetel's age is unknown and Tetsurô hasn't even reached his puberty yet)
Without any means to sound deep, I think the best term to describe them is "soul mates"
There is no question that the two feel devotion, caring and love for each others, yet it goes beyond that of friendship, family and lovers
I think that if their relationship would be stuffed in any of those categories, it would take something out of the whole film and of the characters
The ending scene, even if you already know what is going to happen, is still very touching and memorable
<br /><br />All in all, despite the rushing of plot and some corny scenes, GALAXY EXPRESS 999 holds its place as an anime classic amongst the films like Katsuhiro Otomo's AKIRA (1988) and Mamoru Oshii's GHOST IN THE SHELL (1995)
The film is directed by Rintaro, who had previous experience of Leiji Matsumoto's works as he had worked in CAPTAIN HARLOCK series
Later Rinatro directed a wonderful looking METROPOLIS (2001) that also questions the difference between humans and machines
<br /><br />GALAXY EXPRESS 999 (1979) is a classic that should be seen at least once by every anime fan
I first saw this at a foreign film festival
It's a beautifully paced nail-biter about a plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold
It's all shot in a gritty, grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses --- but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states beautifully (note: Tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when I was there)
<br /><br />There's a lot of humor and some romance, too
I don't want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises, so I'll just say this heist film starts from a great script, and the directing and performances are top notch
DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the fastest and most nerve-racking example of its genre --- I'd put it up against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it's miles ahead of the new OCEAN'S 11, though (deliberately) not as glossy
The question of whether or not one likes this film version of "The Ghost Train" invariably depends on one thing and one thing alone: your reaction to the performance of Arthur Askey
<br /><br />He tends to steal almost every scene he's in, and not always in a good way
Sometimes you wish he'd settle down or back off just a little, to allow the plot's many characters to feature and develop (which they do to some extent)
But somehow everything keeps pointing back to Askey's Tommy Gander character
<br /><br />Personally I like the film, and even like Askey to an extent
I always seem to plonk it into the vcr at those odd hours of the early morning when I can't sleep and really can't find the energy to watch anything else
There is something about watching old b/w movies in the quiet dark of pre-dawn that I find appealing
The performance of every actor and actress (in the film) are excellently NATURAL which is what movie acting should be; and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that I am never tired of seeing it over and over again
However, I am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors' and director, Attenborough's credits that puzzles me: aren't they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent, long lasting film for the audience? I am hoping I would get some answers to my puzzles from some one (possibly one of the "knowledgeable" personnel (insider) of the film
I just saw this movie tonight, opening night
It was great!! I'm a big fan of sports movies, and this was right up there as one of my favorites
my sister lives in Austin, where you live
and she was supposed to buy you a drink once
but she didn't mean to! :C) [not that anyone's going to believe that
Everyone who likes a good sports movie, should go out and see it! :C
I just finished viewing this finely conceived, and beautifully acted/directed movie
It was nip and tuck as to whether I was going to waste my time viewing a movie on the Lifetime Movie Network because of the horribly distracting commercials
Reading the earlier comments persuaded me to give it a shot
After all the worst that could happen would be that I might fall asleep during one of the boring yet lengthy bug spray ads
So why did I watch it? mainly because when IMDB gives a movie a "WEIGHTED AVERAGE" OF 5
<br /><br />I was totally delighted to have taken the time to view this movie, commercial pox and all
Helen Hunt continues to amaze me with her ability to take on tough roles adapting her core persona to fit each role
<br /><br />The portrait she painted in this film of the tough yet perceptively human police officer was beautifully executed
When the scene calls for quick witted, timely delivered verbal intercourse, she can stand toe to toe with any actor
Yet she is adept at the delivery of volumes of emotional response without uttering a word relying only on facial expression and body language
Without the commercials, which by design kill the continuity of any good film, This would have been a real edge-of-the-seat nail-biter
It is always sad when "fringe" movies such as this are overlooked by the majority of filmgoers
"Panic" is a wonderfully compelling and poignant study of a character who feels trapped in the pointlessness of his own life
Macy, as Alex, is as convincing as always
This fine actor seems to have a special talent for pulling at your heartstrings, no matter how flawed his characters may be; we may not always condone the lifestyles of the protagonists he plays, but the emotions of fear and confusion that he evokes in us are often all too painfully familiar
The title, "Panic," initially seems paradoxical, given the lack of overt emotion
At one point Alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry
Yet, as this story unfolds, it becomes increasingly obvious that rage and desperation, not indifference, are the driving forces behind this man's existence
<br /><br />More than once I was reminded of his performance in "Fargo," another strongly character-driven movie
In both "Fargo" and "Panic" we witness a middle aged man who somehow seems to have stepped out of synch with the rest of life
He has lost his way, and the only way back deceptively appears to be though the darkness
He knows he is making bad choices, but desperation overpowers self-control and common sense
<br /><br />Alex connects with Sarah, a 23 year old woman (mesmorizingly played by Neve Campbell), whom he meets in a doctor's office
Thematically, this union is less coincidence, more the work of fate
Alex finds a certain comfort being with Sarah, sensing perhaps that she is a fellow drifter, like him, someone who has lost her way and is floating aimlessly through the rest of her life, waiting powerlessly for its inevitable conclusion
<br /><br />Opting for movies such as this is a shrewd and convincing way for Neve Campbell to answer those critics who question her acting abilities
Too often it is the characters she has played who are the weakness, offering Campbell no depth in which to flex her acting muscles
This performance, however, may be an eye-opener for many
<br /><br />In a perfect movie world, not only would there be many more films like "Panic," but also they would reach and be appreciated by a much wider audience
If you watch movies for the richness and depth of characterization, rather than merely the latest state-of-the-art special effects, then, for you, "Panic" is unmissable
This is why i so love this website ! I saw this film in the 1980's on British television
Over the years it is one i have wished i knew more about as it has stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things i have ever seen in my life
With barely a few key words to remember it by, i traced the film here, and much information, including the fact it's about to become an off-Broadway musical !<br /><br />Interestingly, unlike the previous comment maker, i do not remember finding this film sad, or exploitative
On the contrary, the extraordinary relationship between the mother and daughter stuck in the mind as a testimony of great strength, honour and dignity
Ironic you may think, considering the squalor of their lives
Maybe it's because i live in Britain, where fading grandeur has an established language in the lives of old money, where squalor is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding; I saw it as a rare and unique portrayal of enormous spirit, deep and profound humour, whose utterly fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it poise and respect
In a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a 'cult'
Over the years, as it faded in my mind, it shone the brightest, above all others as a one off brilliant & outstanding televisual experience
It was such a deeply private expose, it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a New York musical
But perhaps somewhere, the daughter will be amused by such an outcome
It is she who will have the last laugh maybe
(They made a musical out of her before you Jackie O'
First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you'll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same
His character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far
The story begins in the (not so far) future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth
The story seems to go towards SF but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story
Movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you'll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down
Its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good
But that doesn't mean that the ending wont pull your nerves, cause its pretty good
As far as the direction goes, it is prefect
Movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better
So, if you are getting ready to see a Sci-Fi movie or some action, you'll miss it
Always enjoy the great acting of Drew Barrymore and her great performance in this film, where she plays a very very complicated young gal,(Holly Gooding),"Skipped Parts",2000, who leaves New York and travels to California and shares an apartment with a up and coming writer, George Newbern,(Patrick Highsmith),"Far Harbor",'96
Many strange things start to happen to Holly and she seeks to find her brother in a mental institution after he killed her father
If you look close enough you will actually see the mother of Drew Barrymore in real life appear as her mother in this picture
If it was not for the good acting of Drew Barrymore and George Newbern, this film should be seen only on Halloween Night! However, it sure has it's surprises in the END!!!
The big problem is where to begin as this movie needs your attention the forthcoming two hours and you better not miss some minutes for getting a coke as there is a danger you can't follow
Bruce Willis must travel into a timemachine to find out some antivirus for a virus that made animals rule over the world in 1996
Thanks to some mistakes he first ends up in 1990, then in the First World War and how messed up it all might look like, Terry Gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever
This ex-Monty Phyton man knows exactly how genius SF-stories has to be told like and his choice of cast couldn't have been any better, there is the lunatic Brad Pitt (his performance in the asylum is memorable) and a superb Bruce Willis who proves he is more than some Schwarzenegger-wanna be
It's a movie you can watch over and over again as the script is so weird and complicated (and yet you can follow) that every view gives you other surprises
I saw this when I was 17 and haven't seen it since
The 'CBS Late Movie' used to show it on a regular basis at one point
I remember how sad and upsetting it was, it truly made me sick to my stomach
Effects then weren't what they are today, but nevertheless, it conveyed the feeling of being alone in the Amazon, after losing both parents and searching for a way out, very well
I remember the bugs and maggots the most, so realistic they were, eating her flesh
It's a dark film which was controversial subject matter at the time, even though likely it was strongly edited for TV
I wish I remembered more details, and if I ever get the chance to see it again, I can comment more
I believe it may have been shown on CBS under yet another title
I have no idea whether it was ever released on video
The 30's is a decade with plenty of movies of every type I can imagine, especially during the early talkies phase
There were movies which are painfully static and dull, like "Dracula" with Bella Lugosi, and there were those that just don't give it a rest, sometimes in a good way and other times not
This is one of the films that don't stop for a minute, and that is both a wonder and a pity
Lloyd Bacon, who also directed "42nd Street", must have been the king of the Depression Era musicals and he was probably excited with the possibilities sound brought to the world of cinema, for he filled this picture with it
There mustn't be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking
It's completely crazy! I was thinking the movie deserved a 5 (or a 6, tops) because the pacing was very poor, since it was insanely fast and I sometimes didn't know what was happening and what to think
The characters seemed to just running to and fro places, talking about things which didn't interest me and probably no one else
I thought I was just going to be rewarded with a small headache
I noticed Lloyd Bacon also cast the female lead in "42nd Street", Ruby Keeler, and "42nd Street" was a movie whose ending was the best part of it
And you know what? It happened the same thing with "Footlight Parade"! The ending is absolutely incredible! It has become, hands down, the most impressive musical I have ever seen
The final part presents us some musical numbers and those are, believe me, something that make seeing the other rest of the movie worth
The numbers are flawless! There are three big bits and the most impressive is surely the second one
Suddenly the screen was filled with gorgeous and inventive camera work, beautiful people and plain entertainment that made me forget my small headache
Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are the mismatched pair who get in the car and go about doing errands according to the need of one or the other
Morgan Freeman is superbly human, relating with one and all, while Paz Vega is the edgy cashier behind the "10 Items or Less" check out line, intimidating customers and bored out of her mind
Together they explore, discover, and learn from each other
To do that of course they must be vulnerable, interested in change, and have a sense of humour, all of which they both have
I wish this film was realistic, I wish this type of story happened more often, I wish we didn't have to go to the movies to realize that we can indeed connect with each other even if we come from vastly different backgrounds
The film's message is based in the open heart, and makes us wonder about the possibility of another world where we meet each other from there - a world where peace could be a possibility
Deanna Durbin, Nan Grey and Barbara Read are "Three Smart Girls" in this Universal film from 1936, which introduces Deanna Durbin to film audiences
It also stars Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady
It's a sweet story about three young women, now living in Switzerland with their divorced mother, who hear their father (Winninger) is marrying again
Not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him, they board a ship to America, with the help of the housekeeper/nanny, determined to stop the wedding
Realizing that the intended, called "Precious" (Barnes) is nothing but a gold-digger aided and abetted by her mother (Brady), they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy Count
This is arranged by their father's accountant (King)
The man he chooses is a full-time drunk (Auer), but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count (Milland)
<br /><br />This is a delightful film, not cloying or overly sugary at all, with some nice performances, particularly by Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady
The young women are pretty and all do good work
The emphasis, of course, is on young Durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully-trained singer
In fact, her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult - she has no trouble with the high notes, as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice
She sings a delightful "Il Bacio" in a police station
<br /><br />One of the nicest things about the film is to see the father, played by Charles Winninger, not want his children around - until he sees them and gets to know them
Barnes as the gold-digger isn't all that young, but the girls' mother looks way up there, so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger, more glamorous woman
In fact, he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters
<br /><br />Universal gives Durbin the big star buildup here - she has the final shot in the movie
Ray Milland at this point was still paying his dues, and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is
<br /><br />Very entertaining and of course, this led to a sequel and big stardom for Deanna
Well, some people would say that this particular movie stinks
but hey! Thats not right, not right at al
The movie may not have the best special effects, and may not have the best actors (Except the exelence of the Barbarian Bros
) Dispite theese minor fact, I can honostly say that this is one of the funniest movies I´ve ever seen, and I´ve seen em al
I absolutely LOVED this movie! It was SO good! This movie is told by the parrot, Paulie's point of view
Paulie is given to the little girl Marie, as a present
Paulie helps Marie learn to talk and they become best friends
But when Paulie tells Marie to fly, she falls and the bird is sent away
Paulie goes through so much to find his way back to Marie
This movie is so sweet, funny, touching, sad, and more
When I first watched this movie, it made me cry
The birds courage and urge to go find his Marie for all that time, was so touching
I must say that the ending is so sweet and sad, but you'll have to watch it to find out how it goes
At the end, the janitor tries to help him, after hearing his story
Will he find his long lost Marie or not? Find out when you watch this sweet, heart warming movie
**************Possible spoilers********** There is only one reason why I saw this movie and that was because I have a massive crush on Richard Belzer
(I don't know that much about humor) There were some part that were funny Like the Barbie and Ken Spoof and the dealers and the president skit
Mind you this is sometimes raunchy(Dare, I say crude?) It was at times funny, but it could have been better
Probably if they spent more time in the humor and less time getting women undress, the movie would had been funnier
Some skits just make you want to gag, and cringe, others skits make you laugh and oddly enough think
If you have a mad crush on Richard Belzer(So worth it) it's worth checking it out and seeing chevy chase
Had this been the original 1914 version of TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY (also starring Mary Pickford), I probably would have rated it a lot higher, as this sort of extreme melodrama and sentimentality was pretty typical of the teens
However, by 1922, this film was already starting to show its age
Pickford's other films (such as DADDY LONGLEGS, SPARROWS, MY BEST GIRL and SUDS), TESS comes up a tad short--and not every Pickford film merits a 10 (even if she was "America's Sweetheart")
Now this isn't to say that it's a bad film--it certainly isn't
But, I just can't see how so many have given this film a 10
<br /><br />The film has a very long and complicated plot--especially because most films of the era were shorter
A rich old crank builds a mansion at the top of a hill next to the river
At the bottom of the hill are some dirty squatters who he hates but who he cannot evict
So he tries to come up with a variety of ways to get them off the land
One ends up in tragedy, when his daughter's fiancé is killed in a scuffle with the po' folks
The man accused of the murder is dear old Mary's father, though he is innocent
To make things a lot worse, the only witness to the real murder won't talk AND the dead man had gotten his fiancée pregnant! So, at this point, we have an innocent man in prison waiting to be executed and a pregnant lady afraid to tell her sanctimonious father she is "in the family way"
There's a ton more to the film, such as the crank's son falling in love with Mary, but it's best you just see the film for yourself
The plot, while very complicated, is also rather interesting and the cinematography is top-notch
However, there is so much overt sentimentality you can practically cut it with a knife
Mary is SO good and SO sweet and So plucky, at times the viewer might find it all a bit hard to take
While it worked great in 1922 (making her the biggest star in the world), today it's very dated
This is NOT true of all her films, but this one certainly is
<br /><br />By the way, the Image Entertainment DVD is of decent quality, though a few scenes are badly degraded--something that isn't very surprising considering the age of the film
Also, the only extras included are a brief filmography
I love this movie and have seen it quite a few times over the years
I agree with all of the positive reviews here
Yes, it's gritty and brutally realistic as life on the prairie was in those days
I found myself doing commentary as I watched it
Someone on here said Rip Torn was miscast
He is brilliant as the dour, miserly Clyde Stewart who says little and works like a slave/workhorse
Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as the widowed Elinor, whom Clyde hires as a housekeeper/cook (along with her 7 old daughter)
Lilia Skala is excellent as distant neighbor called grandma
It is both beautiful and brutal country in which to settle
There are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary
No special effects here, what you see is real! It even has a terrificly perfect music score and a great script
Once you see Heartland, you'll never forget it
What can i say about a tale such as this? This magical tale has followed me from my early childhood,evoking warm memories in my heart
The characters take you to to so many whimsical places making you want more of each scene
For example in the market there were so many different flavors of lore
I loved the exotic dancers that accompanied the steel drums
I wanted so badly for Landsbury to decide to keep the precocious children and for her to also stay with Mr
Brown,and find the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the war
<br /><br />I am still a child inside,and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other
This movie is my definite favorite of all times
I hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away,and transported into another time
It was in 1988, when I saw "The Ronnie and Nancy Show" for the first time (on Austrian television)
At that time, I was already a very big fan of Spitting Image (since when it won the bronze rose of the Montreux Film Festival in 1986)
Of course I recorded every show on tape and watched it again and again - especially "The Ronnie and Nancy Show"
I remember that scene when Ronnie stood in front of a painting of Abraham Lincoln (thinking it was a mirror) and said to himself "I need a shave"
Or most amusing of all, when he played ball with his dog - but vice-versa!<br /><br />It's such a shame, that Spitting Image seems to fall into oblivion; it was one of the most fantastic and most intelligent made TV-shows ever
Compared to other satirical broadcasts it was definitely the best of all
<br /><br />Well, almost 20 years have passed since then, and I wish I could see the show again
Is it possible to purchase it from someone
Only a pretentious, humorless moron would not enjoy this wonderful film
This movie feels like a slice of warm apple pie topped with french vanilla ice cream! I think this is Cher's best work ever and her most believable performance
Cher has always been blessed with charisma, good looks, and an enviably thin figure
Whether you like her singing or not - who else sounds like Cher? Cher has definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone
She is one of the most unique artists out there
It's funny, because who would have thought of Cher as such a naturally gifted actress? She is heads above the so-called movie "stars" of today
Cher is a real actor on the same level as Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett and a few others, in that she never seems to be "acting," she really becomes the character convincingly
She has more than earned the respect of her peers and of the movie-going public
<br /><br />Everything about Moonstruck is wonderful - the characters, the scenery, the dialog, the food
<br /><br />Every time single time I watch the scene where they are all sitting around the dinner table at Rose's house, I pause the remote to see exactly what delicious food Rose is serving
I saw the spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but I can't make out whether they are eating ravioli, ziti? What is that main course? It looks wonderful and its driving me nuts! <br /><br />Everybody in that family was a hardworking individual and they respected and cared about one another
The grandfather wasn't pushed aside and tolerated, he was a vital part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom
He seemed to be a pretty healthy, independent old codger too
<br /><br />Loretta's mom wasn't "just a housewife," she was the glue that held the family together and was a model example of what a wife, mother, and home manager should aspire to be
She was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen but she didn't let it define who she was
High powered businessmen aren't as comfortable in their skin as Rose Casterini was
Notice the saucy way she said "I didn't have kids until after I was 37
" You got the sense that she had been the type of young woman who did exactly as she pleased and got her way without the other person realizing what had happened
She was charming, quick witted, and very smart
What a great mom! <br /><br />I didn't actually like Loretta right away because she seemed like a bit of a know--it-all who wasn't really as adventurous and as in control of herself as she wanted others to think
She could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong, but she really didn't apply common sense to her own life
She was going to marry a middle-aged mama's boy simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose to her life
She was more conventional than her own mom
She dressed and wore her hair like a matron at a house of detention and seemed humorless and bored, but underneath you sensed that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man
She would probably end up making an awesome mom too
<br /><br />I could see in the future, a house full of Loretta and Ronnie's loud, screaming happy kids and Rose and Cosmo enjoying every minute of it
Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) pick-pockets Candy's (Jean Peters) wallet which contains an important microfiche that is intended for the Communist cause
She is being followed by 2 federal agents that are waiting to pounce once she hands the microfiche over to her contact
However, Skip steals the purse on the subway under everyone's noses and so starts a hunt for him by both the police and Joey (Richard Kiley) and Candy who want the microfiche back
Skip can only be traced through Moe (Thelma Ritter) who sells information on criminals
It is made clear to Skip that what he has stolen is important and both sides want the film, but he intends to hold out for a high price
This leads to Joey hunting after him and a conflict between Joey and Jean, who has fallen in love with Skip
Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss
<br /><br />Its a well-acted film and it has a good beginning that gets you involved straight away
Its a bit unrealistic how Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark, but this point is necessary as otherwise why would she later hold out from Joey
While essentially a remake of the original Chinese Ghost Story, this third installment has higher production values and greater subtlety in both the acting and the story
If you still remember that summer when you had your first kiss, first boy/girlfriend, or first puppy love fling
this film is for you! OK so this movie would and will never win an Oscar BUT as a Dominican I loved it
there are some things in the movie that might just go right over your head if you are not part of the culture
the kids being raised by a grandma who's both mother and father, the youngest son being babied and bathed with a Cafe Bustelo tin (sooo Dominican!), Judy being harassed by the neighborhood men, going to church and lighting a prayer candle
the film's brilliance was in those small details
Granted, it was not a pull out all the works cinematic extravaganza but it wasn't meant to be NOR was it meant to be an educational tool for those wanting to learn about Latin culture ( tip: make new friends instead)
More of a bitter-sweet, faux-cumentery, this film kept it real without taking itself too seriously
As in the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tambien" this was simply one boy's coming of age tale
I recommend it (especialmente si eres Dominicano!) =o
This is so to say a sequel to batman the animated and it is pretty much as good as it to and for all the same reasons it has lots of action in it the storyline to it is good the voice over actors are really good such as Kevin Conroy as batman, Mark Hamil as the Joker, etc
The villains are really good such as The Joker, Two-face, Catwoman, Clayface, etc
So i am sure you will not be disappointed with the new adventures of batman because it is really good
So make sure that you watch it on TV or rent or buy the collectors edition because it is really good
<br /><br />Overall score: ********* out of ********** <br /><br />**** out of ****
This movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made
I've seen this movie for the first time a week ago, since then every day I see the opening and every time I feel as thrilled as I felt the first time I heard David Niven uttering the immortal words from Sir Walter Raleigh's The Pilgrimage:<br /><br />Give me my scallop-shell of quiet, My staff of faith to walk upon, My scrip of joy, immortal diet, My bottle of salvation, My gown of glory, hope's true gage; And thus I'll take my pilgrimage ()<br /><br />Do you know why it would be a truism to say Michael Powell's and Emeric Pressuburger's lives are thoroughly justified for having crafted such a wonderful opening? Because they had been already admitted in the Paradise of Poets long before they made this movie
<br /><br />I imagine both of them facing trial during Doomsday and saying nonchalantly to an irate God: I beg your pardon, Sir
So, do You want to know what have we done during our lifetime? Well, well you'll see: We've written directed and produced: I know Where I'm Going, Colonel Blimp, Red Shoes do you think that enough Sir? It is rather obvious that these two great artists had already fulfilled their duty with God, Nature the Muse or Whatever you may call It when they shot A Matter of Life and Death
The fact that other people's lives would be justified for their deeds could be not apparent to everybody, notwithstanding I feel my life would have a meaning had I never done anything else that to see this movie
<br /><br />Of course old-timers will be tempted to say: They don't do movies like this one any more
They'll be partially mistaken; they didn't make movies like this in the past times either
<br /><br />I've have already quoted Keats here, but I'll repeat his words: A thing of beauty is a joy forever
I enjoy movies like this for their spirit, no pun intended
Its a decent, clean movie about a baseball team that's falling behind, and a young fan wishes for them to win, since his deadbeat dad said that was the only way he'd come back for him
<br /><br />The spirit shines through in two ways: A funny cast with Danny Glover and a young Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the heavenly herald Al, taking the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd
It gets you smiling, and really involves you in the sport
the one thing that kinda bugs me is these sports movies that kind of turn you into an unexpecting fan for the team
There's absolutely nothing wrong with that
I just find it odd that I should come away from the movie thinking the Angels are a strong, cool team, when really my base loyalty, such as it is, lies with the Toronto Blue Jays
If it's just a movie about an underdog kids team, then its okay
<br /><br />However, I was disappointed that this movie didn't delve deeper into Achilles's and Athena's relationship
It only blossomed when they kissed each other
Visconti's first feature, Ossessione is an adaptation of James M
Now, I'm not familiar with that book or the other film versions, but I am a big fan of Cain's Double Indemnity (much more so than I am a fan of Billy Wilder's film version of it, in fact)
The two novellas seem like they must be very similar
Both involve an illicit love affair where a ravenous wife complains to a morally weak man that her husband is worthless and mean to her
Giovanna, the woman in this Italian version, played very well by Clara Calamai, is not evil incarnate like the wife in Double Indemnity, but she seems very spoiled
Her husband (a great performance by Juan de Landa) is a bit cruel to her, but she strikes me like she is at least as uncompromising with him
He's older than her and unattractive, so she's rather fickle
When Gino shows up, a young, muscular man, it takes her about five minutes to get him into bed
She sweats she wants to be with him forever, but she's stuck with her husband
They break up at first, but when they meet again, they (apparently, although this is intentionally vague) plan to murder the husband
They are successful, and they move back to the woman's home town to run the bar that her husband owned
Gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea
He wants Giovanna, but the one thing that he certainly doesn't want is to sit around in one place for the rest of his life
Ossessione is a very complex film with complex characters
It's always fascinating, but it does go on a bit too long
At two hours and twenty-two minutes, I can't, for the life of me, figure out how it took that long! This is partly due to the neorealist stylistics that Visconti was inventing within this film
It was, after all, the first film that won that label
We see a lot of the action prolonged as it would be in real life, without any hurrying to the next plot point
I've seen many of Visconti's films, and the only one I like better than this one is Rocco and His Brothers (1960)
His direction is as great as it ever was, with the camera moving brilliantly and the editing perfect
I also feel the need to point out the film's best performance, by Dhia Christiani as a young (exotic) dancer and part-time prostitute named Anita whom Gino meets after he begins to try to break away from Giovanna
She's only in the film for maybe five or six minutes, and she has only a few lines
It's shocking how much Visconti and Christiani are able to do with this character in such a short time
This is the first review I've wrote for IMDb so bare with me, but I caught this flick on HBO and was sure glad I watched it
Richard Gere is great in this film as the passionate agent/detective who bends the rules to get the job done
I think the story is great, and there's never a dull scene that slows the pace of the movie down
Some parts of the movie which have to do with demented sex addicts are pretty shocking, but if you've ever seen a crime film like Se7en, you'll be able to stomach the scenes just fine
<br /><br />So all in all, if you're looking for a good detective/suspense movie, ignore the low rating this movie got on IMDb and definitely watch it
The sopranos was probably the last best show to air in the 90's
its sad that its over, its was the best show on HBO if not on TV, not everything was spelled out for you throughout you had to think, it was brilliant
Tony (James Gandolphini) is a great actor and played his character excellent, as well as the others
Each character had flaws thats what made them so real and allowed the viewers to connect with them and thats one reason it lasted so long
The last episode was good, I'm not sure how to take it many different things can be construed by the ending id like to think that tony didn't die but meadow walked in and sat down with them and that the blackout was just for suspense
Tony will have to go to trial and deal with that hopefully is not dead thats how i feel
The direction is without question breathless
I feel so sorry for Marlene, By the grace of God go you or
Van Dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with Hollywood
Most of the film series' from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios
But apparently Van Dine must have sold his rights to each book about Philo Vance one at a time
Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more all released Philo Vance films
Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more
<br /><br />MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and starred Edmund Lowe as the fashionable detective
Of course MGM had the screen's original Philo under contract at the time, but Bill Powell was busy doing The Thin Man at the time and I guess Louis B
<br /><br />Edmund Lowe is a pretty acceptable Philo Vance
Lowe had started out pretty big at the tail end of the silent era with What Price Glory and then with a string of films with Victor McLaglen with their Flagg and Quirt characters
But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe seemed to fade into the B picture market
<br /><br />The Garden Murder Case involves three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart, and Frieda Inescourt
The sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator kind of gives it away, the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are accomplished
Vance takes a very big chance in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are worthy of Hitchcock
If you're a fan of film noir and think they don't make 'em like they used to, here is your answer -they just don't make 'em in Hollywood anymore
We must turn to the French to remember how satisfying, subtle and terrific a well-made film from that genre can be
Read My Lips is a wonderfully nasty little gift to the faithful from director Jacques Audiard, featuring sharp storytelling and fine performances from Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel
<br /><br />The basic plot could have been written in the 40's: dumb but appealing ex-con and a smart but dowdy femme fatale (who turns out to be ruthlessly ambitious) discover each other while living lives of bleak desperation and longing, manipulate each other to meet their own ends, develop complex love/hate relationship, cook up criminal scheme involving heist, double crosses, close calls and lots of money
All action takes place in depressing, seedy and/or poorly lit locations
<br /><br />Audiard has fashioned some modern twists, of course
The femme fatale is an underappreciated office worker who happens to be nearly deaf and uses her lip reading ability to take revenge on those who marginalize her
And where you might expect steamy love scenes you discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature
Add in a bit of modern technology and music and it seems like a contemporary film, but make no mistake - this is old school film noir
It's as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films I've seen all year
Having heard quite positive reviews and having seen the trailer I had to see this movie
Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell present it had to be good
Overall, the movie is not crack-you-up funny, but there is one scene that really stands out and is, in a my eyes, a classic
SPOILER At the end, where they break through the wall to get to the safe and we see Rockwell and Washington stare at Jeter is just fantastic
This is just as good as the scene in The Big Lebowski where The Dude is using a chair to barricade his door, but forgets the door turns outward! END SPOILER Just go see this movie, you won't be disappointed
Tom and Butch Cat fight over the capture of Jerry Mouse because the one who doesn't catch Jerry gets kicked out
The two cats dress in their master's clothing to disguise themselves and lets the other have it! Confused, Tom and Butch whack their master's rear and all three of them get kicked out
First of all I am a butch, straight white male
But even with that handicap I love this movie
I had many gay friends growing up in New York in the eighties and the one thing about them i always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live them
This is a great film, watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant African American or Hispanic Gay man in the New York of the eighties
This is NOT as bad a movie as some reviewers, and as the summary at the IMDB page for this movie, say it is
Why? First is the fact that in 1984 the movie makers were daring enough to confront, as one of the plot elements, the issue of domestic violence -- so reviewers who complain about the plot are sadly missing one of the main points! Second, without the plot element of Prince's movie relationship with his abusive father, the musical climax wouldn't work as well as it does -- so those reviewers who say that only the music is good have, once again, missed one of the points -- specifically, WHY it is so good
because all of the music in this film has a plot element backdrop that makes the music more effective
Third, give this movie a break! For first-time movie producers and director, this is just not that bad! There are far worse movies out there by accomplished movie people!! And last, the reviewers who say that the music is "good" have also missed the point -- check out the range of stylistic musical treatments, the variety, the musicianship, and the stage performance of Prince -- truly one of a kind, going musically where no one else was going during the 1980's, and with a style seen in the work of other artists (clothes and movement: which costuming elements came first, Michael Jackson's or Prince's? Also, see if you can spot the splayed fingers sweeping in front of the eyes that Prince does in this movie, long before Quentin Tarentino's "Pulp Fiction")
As the sum of its parts, not a bad movie at all
This is one of the best movies out there and that's saying a lot being that it was for television
<br /><br />Helen Hunt gave such a raw performance
She played a rookie cop thrown into serial killer case perfectly
When she falls apart because he kills another kid it was amazing
When she talks about her mother! WOW!<br /><br />Steven Weber as the serial killer was so shocking! He really brought her into his dark world
When he talks about killing the kids, scary! When he realizes who she really is! What a scene!!<br /><br />They really don't make them like that anymore
It was a real thriller without being gory
This is one irresistible great cheerful- and technically greatly made movie!<br /><br />The movie features some of the greatest looking sets you'll ever see in a '30's movie, even though it's all too obvious that they are sets, rather than real place locations
Often if a character would fall or shake a doorpost too aggressive, the entire set would obviously move
<br /><br />The best moments of the movie were the silent, more old fashioned, slapstick kind of moments
It shows that René Clair's true heart was at silent movie-making
The overall humor is really great in this movie
Also of course the musical moments were more than great
This is a really enjoyable light and simple pleasant early French musical
Though the best moments are the silent moments, that does not mean that the movie is not filled with some great humorous dialog, that gets very well delivered by the main actors, who all seemed like stage actors to me, which in this case worked extremely well for the movie its overall style and pleasant no-worries atmosphere
No wonder this worked out so well, since this movie is actually based on stage play by Georges Berr
<br /><br />It's a technical really great movie, with also some great innovation camera-work in it and some really great editing, that create some fast going and pleasant to watch enjoyable sequences
There is never a dull moment in this movie!<br /><br />René Clair was such a clever director, who knew how to build up and plan comical moments within in movies
It's a very creative made movie, that despite its simplicity still at all times feel as a totally original and cleverly constructed movie, that never seizes to entertain
<br /><br />The last half hour is especially unforgettably fun, without spoiling too much, and is really among the greatest, as well as most creative moments in early comedy film-making
<br /><br />The movie is filled with some really enjoyable characters, who are of course all very stereotypical and silly and were obviously cast because of their looks
It all adds to the pleasant light comical atmosphere and cuteness of the movie
<br /><br />One of the most pleasant movies you'll ever see!<br /><br />8/1
Neither the total disaster the UK critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist, Revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers
But then, nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew, especially one using the gangster/con-artist movie framework
As might be expected from Luc Besson's name on the credits as producer, there's a definite element of 'Cinema de look' about it: set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap, it looks great, has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style, all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment
But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck, and he's spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything
If anything its problem is that he's trying to throw in too many influences (a bit of Machiavelli, a dash of Godard, a lot of the Principles of Chess), motifs and techniques, littering the screen with quotes: the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims, and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn't want to turn into a movie
Rather than a commercial for Kabbalism, it's really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce, chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film's central (somewhat metaphysical) con
<br /><br />The last third is where most of the problems can be found as Jason Statham takes on the enemy (literally) within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people's exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger, but it's got a lot going for it all the same
Not worth starting a new religion over, but I'm surprised it didn't get a US distributor
Maybe they found Ray Liotta's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary
When American author Edgar Allan Poe visits London, he is approached by British journalist Alan Foster, who becomes the target of a peculiar wager
Not believing Poe's assertion that all of his macabre stories have been based on actual experience, Foster accepts a bet from Poe and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood that he cannot spend an entire night in the Blackwood's haunted castle
Once installed in the abandoned castle, Foster discovers that he is not alone, as he is approached by various beautiful women and handsome men, and a doctor of metaphysics - who explains that they are all lost souls damned to replay the stories of their demises on the anniversary of their deaths! The first time I watched this glorious bit of classic horror, I was mesmerized the entire time
I found the movie genuinely creepy and at the same time sorrowful
The music score makes the atmosphere twice as terror inducing
The topless scene threw me for a loop, as I was not expecting it
It looks as Synapse did a great job with picture enhancement, because this movie looks damn fine for its age, and it's the Uncut International version, to boot
This is the movie responsible for me starting a Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski collection
Noll's comfortable way of rolling out blunt comments, often with expletives, to describe things that he is more knowledgeable about than most is quite refreshing
There is one other character in the film that constantly tries to verbalize complicated issues, using more language than necessary
This guy should never have been given a Thesaurus
Cut to Noll and you know you're in for a treat!<br /><br />The way the pioneers of big wave surfing are portrayed is very evocative of a "lost era"
Nevermind the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living, much less took care of issues like medical care
The use of old film clips throughout was masterfully done
Usually I don't really like Emma Roberts so much, but after watching Nancy Drew it kind of changed my mind
The actors in the movies made the whole thing exciting and funny
Most of the time when you watch a mystery movie you can solve it before the middle of the show, but in this movie it's like you are actually there
The clues have to all fit together until you can finally understand the whole crime
The whole movie was really clever and the people who watched it with me loved the movie too
The clothes were my favorite part of the movie, it was so cute
I don't think there will be another movie like this until the sequel comes out
I give it a nine because the popular girls didn't really seem to have the part just right, but they still make me laugh
It was a really great movie and a great mystery
Prussic gas, a murderer donning a red clansman suit and hood wielding a white whip, and the murders of college school girls at the hands of paid convicts enlisted by a mysterious mastermind who keeps his face hidden within an office containing aquariums of turtles and fish
The inspectors at Scotland Yard, Higgins(IJoachim Fuchsberger)and his superior Sir John(Siegfried Schürenberg)certainly have their hands full with this case
It all seems to center around student Ann Portland(Uschi Glas), who, when she turns 21, is to inherit a great deal of wealth
The girls who are targeted share a room with Ann, but the reason for their murders remains a mystery SY's finest must figure out
The staff of the girls' dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise, talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip
Two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation
It's a clever scheme where a driver, Greaves(Günter Meisner)meets the convicts(
who hide in a barrel)who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard
Taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind, he gives them orders on who to kill and how
Uncovering this operation is a top priority for Higgins and Sir John for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening
Under suspicion are girls' dormitory headmistress, her author brother, a sweaty, incredibly nervous chemistry teacher, a snooping gardener, and the Bannister
Some are red herrings until they are disposed of, throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered
<br /><br />Out of the Krimi films I've seen, THE COLLEGE GIRL MURDERS is the closest to a giallo with it's colorful killer, a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects, & sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory
I think you can also see the influence of James Bond on this particular Krimi film with the villain mastermind's secret hideout with an alligator pit(
which isn't used), the fake bible/water pistol, when opened, fires the gas into the face of startled victims, the Greaves' Royles Royce which has latches that cause flaps to darken the windows without revealing the passenger in the back seat, and the peep holes used to spy on the girls in their rooms and while swimming
Many might consider Sir John a liability due to his bumbling, buffoonish behavior and how he often undermines Higgins' abilities to get at the truth(
perhaps poking fun at know-it-all British inspectors who harm a case more than solve it)
I felt he was used as comedy relief, particularly with his attempts at psychoanalyzing suspects and potential victims, often misunderstanding what are told to him
Higgins, using the skills adopted over his years as an investigator, instead follows the clues/facts, often avoiding Sir John as much as possible
Capable direction by the reliable Alfred Vohrer who keeps the pace humming at a nice speed, and the screenplay is full of interesting characters and lurid content
the fact that so many of the adults surrounding the dormitory are suspect, any of them might be the one wielding the whip or calling the shots behind those murdered girls' executions
if not the best)examples of the Krimi genre, for it keeps you guessing, always one more ace up it's sleeve
the revelations unearthed at the very end are quite eye-opening(
and, you even get a literal unmasking of the real mastermind pulling the strings to top it all off)
Just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and especially nice looking film
The story is simple but effective, the characters lovable and nicely fleshed out but what really shines is the digital set design
<br /><br />More inspired by traditional animated movies than reality, the designs give you a really, really nice looking world in a astounding use of colour
Sometimes the touches of reality shine through (especially the water was impressive), but nonetheless, it's a fantasy-world based on reality
Including loads of vast landscapes especially helps to minimise the costs of rendering
<br /><br />Pixar films shine with technical brilliance, this one shines with effective uses of technical know-how
<br /><br />Enough technical babble, the film's entertaining, family-friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny
Oh, what fun there is here! <br /><br />Amy Heckerling has a flair for directing comedy (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Look Who's Talking) but here it looks like she told the actors to go out and have fun
Micheal Keaton breezes through the role of Johnny, easily his best screen performance
Joe Piscopo is great as the appropriately named Danny Vermin, what a shame directors didn't pick up on this
And I have even mentioned Richard Dimitri playing Moronie and the character's unique vocabulary
I don't think it's an accident that the bulk of the character's name is spelled MORON
<br /><br />Good lines are sprinkled throughout the movie, with Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne
Maurren Stapleton, Merilu Henner given good lines
Even actors with minor roles like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale get in a good lines
There's a bit of miscasting -- Frank Sinatra is sorely miscast as the Jewish Nathan Detroit, though it only becomes evident on "Sue Me", which is a distinctly Jewish song
Sadly, the filmmakers decided to cut out one of the best songs from the show, "Marry the Man Today", and replaced it with an inferior Sinatra showpiece
With these two flaws in mind, the movie is otherwise magnificent
Marlon Brando can't sing worth beans, but pulls it off anyway
Stubby Kaye wonderfully reprises his Broadway role (it was written for him)
Damon Runyon's language and pacing and humor come through quite well
This is on my see-it-every-chance-I-get list
Although I've long been a fan of Peter Weir, I hadn't watched any of his Australian movies until I watched The Last Wave
And it was a pleasant, unpredictable surprise
<br /><br />Richard Chamberlain plays David, a lawyer invited to defend five aborigines charged with murdering another Aborigine
For David's peers it's a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence
But David believes there's a mystery underneath the murder, linked to tribal rituals
As his investigation proceeds he learns not only things about his clients but about himself too
<br /><br />To reveal more would be to spoil one of the strangest movies I've ever seen
I can only say that this movie goes in directions that no one will be expecting
<br /><br />There are many elements that make this a fascinating movie: Chamberlain's acting, for instance; but also the performances by David Gulpilil, who plays a young aborigine who introduces David into tribal mysteries; and Nandjiwarra Amagula, who plays an old aborigine who's a spiritual guide
The relationships between these three characters make the heart of the movie
<br /><br />But there's also the way Weir suggests the supernatural in the movie
David has dreams that warn him of the future
Australia is undergoing awful weather, with storms, hail falling and even a mysterious black rain that may be nothing more than pollution
But it's also related to the case David is defending
How it's related is one of the great revelations of the movie
Out of little events Weir manages to create an atmosphere of dread and oppression, suggesting future horrors without really showing anything
<br /><br />Charles Wain's score is fantastic, especially the use of the didgeridoo
Russell Boyd, Weir's longtime DP who won an Oscar in 2004 for Master and Commander, depicts a dark, creepy world full of mystery
<br /><br />I also find it remarkable that for a movie centered on aborigines, it doesn't turn into an indictment against white culture or into a sappy celebration of the their traditions, like Dances With Wolves or The Last Samurai
This movie is too clever to be that simplistic
<br /><br />Sometimes it can be frustrating, and it may upset viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything making sense; but for those who don't mind some strangeness or ambiguity, The Last Wave is a great movie to watch
Perhaps this could be the best movie ever made and if it's not it's certainly one of those who are burned onto your pupils as what Brian De Palma delivers here is a great piece of cinematographic artwork
First there is the director's touch of Brian De Palma who proves once again he might be one of the best directors ever, there is the superb performance from Al Pacino who is delivering an immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana), there are the many different (violent) scenes that you will never forget (the one with the chainsaw, the one in where Tony is sitting in a bath which is as big as most people's living rooms), there are the many superb one-liners (count how many times the word "f*ck" is used), there are the superb little details (the Pan American-globe that screams "The world is yours") or the great discomusic from Giorgio Moroder
Nothing can be named that isn't sublime here and it easily is along with "The Godfather", "Good fellas" and "White heat" one of the best gangstermovies ever made
Freddy Krueger the dream stalker from elm street returns,the great character actor Robert englund is back in this sequel of nightmare 5, dream child
there's been so many,and this one is one of the best,especially for the cameos by;Rosanne Barr (then Arnold)tom Arnold,johnny depp,(who did the very first nightmare in 84)alice cooper(singer)you will see Freddy as a tormented child,a teenager who loves pain,and as a family guy(creepy)the effects are very funny and creative,the cast also includes Lisa Zane(Billy's sister) breckin Meyer(road trip)yaphet kotto(alien,live and let die)and Amanda Donahue(father knows best)i was one of the people 3who saw this in 3d,well the ending
i missed the first 3d wave in 1953(i wasn't even born yet)the second wave was in 1983
this one stands out as one of the better ones not counting the first which was absolutely brilliant,Freddy became the new monster of the 80s and 90s,along with Jason voorhees,chucky,Micheal myers,and leather face
can you imagine a film with all of them?i recommend this to all Freddy fans and horror fans alike
this one has it all: nudity, good fight scenes, gore, action, explosions etc
It also stars the wonderful Belinda Mayne as Ingrid - not Olga as the other reviewer pointed out - although Olga turns into Ingrid later on in the film (you'll have to watch it to see what I mean)
<br /><br />I won't bother to go into the story as it's far too long winded and not very interesting
The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo (Robert Ginty) is interesting - watch the towel stealing scene to see what I mean
<br /><br />The fight scenes were at once quite good and then spoilt by some really shoddy gore effects that looked like they were done by the team who did City of the Walking Dead (i
strange coloured blood gushing out of neck wounds)
<br /><br />I'd advise fans of low budget trash to check it out if they can track down a copy - its pretty rare though and I couldn't ever see anyone bothering to re-release it so it'll become all the rarer in a few years
<br /><br />Anyway I'd recommend it solely for Belinda Mayne's great nude scenes! That lady's a fox
Cannot believe my eyes when read quite a bunch of other comments and reviews
As if it were a mediocre movie of some run-of-the-mill dudes
<br /><br />The movie is great, funny, crazy, over-the-top violent though with minimum gore, and all the way energetic to the core
Can't remember anything insane like this made for laughs and martial art showing off
And now the most important thing (at least to me): it is computer effects free
When I watch some Hollywood actors duking it out on screen in modern high-resolution and damn high-budgeted action "fuflo" (a Russian word that means "bull*beep*"), I understand that any *beep* child can do it - you can adjust the wires to the body, add some cute PC effects, and stuff it into the action film
I don't think that there will be even a dozen of physically advanced action stars worldwide, who can repeat the brawl that takes place at the end of the film or the "Chinese football" play
And it is just a little Hong Kong cinema made for fun, not pretending to be "Star Wars"
<br /><br />Having a DVD with English soundtrack is not a problem with this movie
<br /><br />Can't help mentioning a very neat theatrical play
Have a look at the Dragon's friend who is talking in a brave manner to the criminals and all of a sudden gets a fist punch in his left side of the head
His face expression changes into something whimsical and he comes up to Dragon with a baby expression
And take a look at the menacing size of his mouth - it's nearly from one ear to the other long when he makes grimaces
<br /><br />This movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people all over the world
Very thankful to our Russian industry for the releases of classic Jackie Chan movies
His modern ones are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not deserve much hype
<br /><br />Total 10 out of 10 - a legendary movie in its genre
Beautiful to watch, but what would be the first thing you would do the moment YOU discovered Atlantis? Explore it! Here was a golden opportunity to take viewers someplace special
Instead, Disney reverted to the same old formula story telling
Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney
That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist
He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride
<br /><br />But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me
Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination
Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like? The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true
Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing
from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences
and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself
Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi! Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here
This documentary provides the viewers with unique footage about the 2003 coup in Venezuela
This great film is now the minimum knowledge requirement if you want to express a competent opinion about Venezuela or Hugo Chavez
<br /><br />The dramatic, electrified atmosphere, the unique footage will allow you to experience a true historic moment
You'll feel like you're in the middle of the situation
<br /><br />The film will help you gain unique insight in the happenings of 2003 and will help you hear a side you will rarely hear on TV
A charming little film set in the UK about the reunion of a WWII all girl (almost) swing band
A fine cast of oldsters bring lighthearted perspectives on life to this fun tale with an award winning performance by Dench and Laine's always great "pipes"
A warm, sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) who are carrying on a romance via mailbox without either of them knowing it
The key to this film's success is that Ernst Lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give low-key, unfussy performances
As a result, you fall in love with virtually all of them
<br /><br />There's a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which I appreciated
Loneliness is a major theme, most obviously represented in the character of the shop's owner and manager, played wonderfully by Frank Morgan
He discovers that he's being cuckolded by his wife, and realizes that the successful life he's created for himself isn't enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he doesn't have a partner to share it
This makes the timid romance between Stewart and Sullavan all the more poignant, because they're both reaching out to this unseen other, who each thinks of as a soulmate before they've even met
Of course we know everything will turn out right in the end, but the movie doesn't let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality didn't live up to the fantasy
<br /><br />Lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry
The little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family, and that's exactly how it feels to us as well
<br /><br />This is a wonderful, unsung romance
A coral comedy full of his own landmarks, with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments, we laughed and laughed, what a party! The music is everywhere, and also the shooting, the animals, the crazy bastards, sex and amazing gadgets and inventions, everything colorfully visual to entertain only
And one is specially grateful since good comedies are so rare, and so wonderful
Well, this is one, and if you enjoyed Kusturica's previous films, you'll love this, although, as in all comedies, it is about a chemical reaction, and you have to be in the mood for it
"Foxes" is one movie I remember for it's portrayal of teenagers in the late 1970's
As I am exactly Jodie Foster's age, I related to this movie
It deals with the frustrations, temptations, relationships & rebellion of youth
The soundtrack is great with inspiring rock eg
"More Than a Feeling" by Boston and sad numbers like "On the Radio" by Donna Summer
Yep, I'll always remember this one, even if it wasn't huge
Definitely one of the lesser of the Astaire/Rogers musicals
It only runs a few minutes longer than Swing Time, for example, but it feels a heck of a lot longer
This is partly due to the secondary romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard
She's sweet, and I love at least one of her songs, "But Where Are You?" ("Get Thee Behind Me Satan", her other number, is a weak leftover from Top Hat, thankfully cut from that masterpiece)
Follow the Fleet would actually be a bad film if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between Astaire and Rogers
The dancing contest vies for the top spot of any of their numbers
"I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket" presents the two rehearsing a dance that they don't quite have perfected yet
Its imperfections make it all the more perfect
And "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is easily one of Irving Berlin's best songs
So the film is well worth watching for its great moments
The movie was much better than the other reviewer stated
It has a fun fantasy aspect of some time travel
The story revolves around a 14 year old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time in the old elevator of her apartment building
Of course, no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances
She finds and makes friends with a girl about her age and is able to help the girl's family in many ways
She is also able to help her own relationship with her father in the long run
It reminds me of a Hallmark movie so give it a chance and decide for yourself
It seemed to be aimed more towards children about 6-12 years (maybe a bit older) and it's pretty much PG or G rated
I'm an adult who can appreciate a nice "family" movie - I guess the other reviewer isn't
BASEketball is awesome! It's hilarious and so damned funny that you will wet your pants laughing
I have seen it so many times I have stopped counting
BASEketball is a surefire hit and I loved it and will continue to love it
I hope one day there will be a special edition DVD brought out!!!<br /><br />Ten Thumbs Up!!
I was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes into the start - every time I even thought going to bed, something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my bedtime
<br /><br />This movie could have been another easy slam dunk anti-gun film, but instead they chose to examine the aftereffects of the shootings
And even better, the movie kept on with the real life - just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out, a twist comes along and changes the whole outlook of the movie
This film not only doesn't follow the formula, it shows how other events often lead up to and/or affect what happens afterwards
<br /><br />I only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around anti-depressant drugs more - the kids from Columnbine who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way Deanna popped them every time the nightmares started
Up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have
It was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film, having a relative who suffers from a mental illness, I can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental illnesses
Bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues
And for those who think certain things couldn't happen in a hospital (I don't want to tell any particulars), you're dead wrong on that too - I've been there
<br /><br />Go BUY this film and show it to your teenage kids before it's too late
I'd heard of Eddie Izzard, but had never seen him in action
I knew he was a transvestite, and when I saw he was on HBO one night last summer, I put it on, not knowing how my husband would react
He has total control of the audience; when he does the 'Englebert is dead - no he's not', routine, the audience doesn't know what to think by the end
God as James Mason is also an inspired touch, and his version of the Python Spanish Inquisition as carried out by the Church of England - 'Cake or Death?' is priceless
My jaws were aching from laughter by the end of the show
We scoured the TV listings for months after that to be able to see him again, and were lucky enough to tape him the next time he came on
If you get the chance to see this show, cancel everything and tape it, you won't be disappointed
This movie is very entertaining, and any critique is based on personal preferences - not the films quality
Other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by Murphy, the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor
It has some pretty good special effects, and exciting action scenes
<br /><br />As a finder of lost children, Murphy's character starts off looking for a missing girl, which leads him on the path for which others believe he was "chosen" - - to protect the Golden Child
The young boy is born as an enlightened one, destined to save the world from evil forces, but whose very life is in danger, if not for the help of Murphy, and his beautiful, mysterious and mystical helper/guide/protector
<br /><br />Also, there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts
One such scene is where the Golden Child, that Murphy's character is solicited to protect, is tested by the monks of the mountain temple
An elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from, and the child is tested on his choice
<br /><br />This is a fantasy/comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware
As we accept this premise of the plot, we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality, and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away, and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us
<br /><br />This is an excellent movie, with a good plot, fine acting, and for the most part, pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of Martial Art fighting, and Eddie Murphy humor
After Racism, Rural exodus -also known as migration from the country side- is another socio-political issue of the 1960s
WestSide Story had dealt with Racism by a love feast in an artistic view
Now, Midnight Cowboy deals with rural exodus by a friendship tragedy in a psychological view
It has a deeply grievous ending that we witness one of the two companions of fate passing away
<br /><br />Director John Schlesinger skillfully deliver us the deepest secret thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and evaluations of two New York City scums
While the handsome Joe Buck(Voight) dreams of all the beautiful women of the world begging him to share a wild love fantasy, the poor Ratso Rizzo(Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in clean and sunny Florida
Accordingly, Joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality; and Ratso becomes a snatcher to collect enough money to migrate into Florida
Besides Ratso helps Joe to find his way to do whatever he can
They share food, they share medicine, they share an uninhabited home, they share their earnings and thus they share a destiny
Regrettably as the story progresses, Joe realizes that being handsome is not the only thing to make all the beautiful women begging him to have fun; and moreover Ratso cannot see Florida since his heart fails defeated to his disease whilst he was on the bus taking him there
<br /><br />The Might is always right, and the Feeble has no right in the daylight
Thence, "Midnight" gives the factual sight
<br /><br />Despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy
Every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear their inevitable fate
Thanks to this, Midnight Cowboy is a provocative view of a socio-political issue, the rural exodus
Monstrous mother-son-duo (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) sucks life-force of virgins, and their newest target is pretty but lonely Tanya (Madchen Amick)
However, these monsters are allergic to cat's scratches
I have never been fan of sleazy, overrated bestsellerists like King, Koontz or Barker, but this B-movie, written by Mr Dung himself, is actually not near as bad than it could be
Yes, it is sometimes jaw-droppingly atrocious, but there is actually some surprisingly impressive touches: good old-fashioned graveyard, eerie soundtrack and candlelit-Gothic-house-scene, mirror showing the monstrous form of the villains, etc
Of course, the film is polluted by Mr Dung's potty-mouthed dialogue and all-tactics-of-toilet-seat obsession to vilify fat people, leading to totally pointless subplot of rapist teacher, but there is roses among manure
This independent, B&W, DV feature consistently shocks, amazes and amuses with it's ability to create the most insane situations and then find humor and interest in them
It's all hilarious and ridiculous stuff, yet as absurd as much of the film should be, there is a heart and a reality here that keeps the film grounded, keeps the entire piece from drifting into complete craziness and therein lies the real message here
This film is about how we all survive in a world gone mad
For as insane and off the wall as things get, Leon, the 30 yr
old paperboy-protagonist, always tries to keep it together
He's like a child forever trying to catch the balloon that is floating away so that everything will work out for the best, so that everyone can have what they want
<br /><br />The acting in the film could have went far over the top but the exceptional cast really keeps the piece cohesive
Van Meter is perhaps the best of the bunch here with a performance that shines through her absurd diseased tics
Just as the characters in the film do, we overlook her sudden outbursts to see the real person underneath
<br /><br />Majkowski is a true genius here
He takes the utmost ridiculous plot twists and keeps them real
It is his script and his cast that help keep the whole thing afloat
It's a true testament to the skill of Majkowski and all involved that this film, with it's grating plot and characters, never once works our nerves
Majkowski has taken a film that could have been abrasive and repugnant, and somehow given it heart and humor
The writing, directing, acting all are fantastic
Quality performances by actors, Ally Sheedy is strong and dynamic and delightfully quirky
Really original and heart-warmingly unpredicatable
The scenes are alive with fresh energy and really talented production
Normally the best way to annoy me in a film is to include some reference to Orson Welles
But here is a sci-fi comedy quoting the War of the Worlds broadcast
and it is gold! The very concept of a small bunch of diminutive,aggressive and stupid aliens being mistaken as kids in Halloween dress is magnificent
Don't be fooled by the notion that because it seems like a kids' movie it is unsophisticated - it isn't, there's a lot of hidden treasure
"Hanzo The Razor - Sword Of Justice", 1972) and its excellent (and even sleazier) sequel "Goyôkiba: Kamisori Hanzô jigoku zeme" (aka
"Razor 2: The Snare", 1973), this "Goyôkiba: Oni no Hanzô yawahada koban" aka
"Razor 3: Who's Got The Gold" is the third, and sadly final installment to the awesome saga about the incorruptible Samurai-constable Hanzo 'The Razor' Ittami (brilliantly played by the great Shintarô Katsu), who fights corruption with his fighting expertise as well as his enormous sexual powers
As a big fan of 70s exploitation cinema made in Nippon, "Sword Of Justice" became an instant favorite of mine, and I was therefore more than eager to find the sequels, and full of anticipation when I finally stumbled over them recently
While this third "Hanzo" film is just not quite as brilliant as its predecessors it is definitely another great piece of cult-cinema that no lover of Japanese exploitation cinema can afford to miss
"Who's Got The Gold" is a bit tamer than the two foregoing Hanzo films, but it is just as brilliantly comical and crudely humorous, and immediately starts out fabulously odd: The film begins, when Hanzo's two assistants see a female ghost when fishing
Having always wanted to sleep with a ghost, Hanzo insists that his assistants lead him to the site of the occurrence
If that is not a promising beginning for an awesome film experience, I don't know what is
Shintaro Katsu, one of my personal favorite actors, is once again brilliant in the role of Hanzo, a role that seems to have been written specifically for him
Katsu IS Hanzo, the obstinate and fearless constable, who hates corruption and deliberately insults his superiors, and whose unique interrogation techniques include raping female suspects
The interrogated women than immediately fall for him, due to his sexual powers and enormous penis, which he trains in a rather grotesque routine ritual
I will not give away more about the plot in "Who's Got The Gold", but I can assure that it is as cool as it sounds
The supporting performances are also very good, and, as in the predecessors, there are plenty of hilariously eccentric characters
This is sadly the last film in the awesomely sleazy 'Hanzo' series
If they had made 20 sequels more, I would have happily watched them all! The entire Hanzo series is brilliant, and while this third part is a bit inferior compared to its predecessors, it is definitely a must-see for all lovers of cult-cinema! Oh how I wish they had made more sequels
Since this is Black History Month and I'm reviewing the achievements of many African-Americans on film in chronological order, I got this movie on VHS from the library because Duke Ellington and his Orchestra were in it
Their jazz version of Franz Liszt's "Rhapsody" was the highlight of this mostly overlong murder mystery-musical comedy mixture
Many other numbers I liked were Kitty Carlisle's especially "Sweet Marijuana", Carl Brisson's "Cocktails for Two" as well as his duet with Carlisle on that earlier, and the ones by Gertrude Michael who's great as the woman you love to hate
Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen probably go a little too long with their love/hate banter as the producer and detective but they grow on you
And Toby Wing is a sexy dumb tease as Nancy who keeps trying to say something to Oakie but gets a "Not now" from him every time
While many of the characters have a motive for the murders that happen, I wasn't surprised by the revelation of who done it
And get a load of how naked the women here are (though of course their breasts are covered, either by their hands or some flimsy top)
Worth a look for any film buff interested in this sort of thing
As a long-time Louisiana resident, I like noting when someone was born here as Carlisle was a New Orleans native
Titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies
It has its problems (what movies don't) but still, it's enjoyable
<br /><br />When I stumble across someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is "wait a minute, you don't?" I know so many people who don't like this movie, and I'm not saying I don't see why
"The love story is too cheesy" well, yes but isn't it enjoyable and moving? All right, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this doesn't actually exist
But this is a movie, doesn't everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors
Well, OK, in this movie, I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials
However I think it's unfair to say that they are terrible actors
I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in
But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected
<br /><br />And finally, if one is going to complain that they don't like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I'm sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things
It's like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies
Simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this IS a good movie
<br /><br />Well deserving of its Oscars, in particular, Best Cinematography, which I find to be the best I've ever seen in a movie save maybe the Lord of the Rings trilogy
<br /><br />I know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each other's names throughout the movie
The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it's an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic
<br /><br />I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed
<br /><br />I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults
The only main ones I can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it
<br /><br />I give this movie 10/10, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it's an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events
While rehearing Carmen of Bizet, the middle-aged choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gades) brings the sexy Carmen (Laura del Sol) to perform the lead role
Antonio falls in love for Carmen, who is an independent and seductive woman incapable to accept a possessive love
When Carmen has an affair with another dancer, Antonio is consumed by his jealousy like D
José in the original opera, entwining fiction with reality
<br /><br />"Carmen" is another great movie of Carlos Saura's trilogy dedicated to the Flamenco dance
The dramatic love story is developed with the lives of the artists entwined with the characters they are rehearsing, and many times is not absolutely clear whether what is happening is reality (with the dancers) or fiction (of the play)
Paco de Lucia is another attraction of this original version of the famous Bizet's opera, which is based on the novel of Prosper Mérimée
No, this hilariously horrible 70's made-for-TV horror clinker isn't about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake
Still, this exceptionally awful, yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute, unremitting silliness and atrociousness that's quite tasty in a so-execrable-it's-downright-awesome sort of way
Richard Crenna, looking haggard and possibly inebriated, and Yvette Mimieux, who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in "Jackson County Jail," sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint, dull, sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute German Shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit
Pretty soon Mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (the psychic alien moppets from the Disney "Witch Mountain" pictures) are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty, ugly canine entity in the den
Boy, now doesn't that sound really scary and disturbing? Well, scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ain't, but it sure is funny, thanks to Curtis ("Night Tide") Harrington's hopelessly weak direction, cartoonish (not so) special effects, an almost painfully risible'n'ridiculous plot, and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story (besides the leads, both Martine Beswicke and R
Armstrong briefly pop up as members of a Satanic cult and Victor Jory has a nice cameo as a helpful Native American shaman)
Favorite scene: the malicious Mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on Crenna, practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade
While stuck-up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock, devout TV trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to Alpo
It is about many things: the hunt for a serial killer, the bureacracy of Soviet Russia, the drive of one man, and the relationship between this man (the lead detective) and his superior
<br /><br />The thing that sticks with me the most is the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (excuse bad spelling, please!)
For some reason, it is moving to see their evolution from hostility and offense turning into respect and cameraderie and working together
One line in the movie sums it up for me: "He would say something witty, but he is overcome with emotion
"<br /><br />Excellent acting by all of the cast, even the smallest parts were done with believability
<br /><br />This is not a fast-paced action thriller; in fact, it moves at times like a slow drama, but it is worth it
Very satisfying and not exploitative about the crimes at all
Personally, I absolutely love this movie and novel(I read the book first and decided to see the movie)
First of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind
The acting is also great and i love the cast
Judd Crandall (plays Fred Gwynne) fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you
There are also a few corny lines thrown in there (Idk if they were meant to be corny), but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh
The Maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie
Not only will you love it but you'll want to see it again and again, I recommend this 100% to any horror fan!
I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated, and urban
The showing I attended had a sprinkling of African-Americans, and it made the difference in audience-reaction between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of race relations in this country
Basically, the white folks were AFRAID to laugh or laughed nervously at the funny bits --and there are many! -- because they'd be "laughting at Blacks", while the Blacks also stayed pretty silent because many couldn't laugh at themselves in front of the whites
<br /><br />I, on the other hand, being Asian (and thus belonging to neither group), had a great time viewing this satire of rap culture and its egos/trappings/values/pseudo-philosophies
The cast is talented and does at great job becoming the characters portrayed
<br /><br />This film is one of the best pseudo-documentaries to come along, including "A Mighty Wind
This film starts out with a family who were all going in different directions and their teenage daughter Martha MacIssac (Olivia Dunne) was very much in love with Joe MacLeod,(Zack)
The mother is played by Mitzi Kapture,(Jill Dunne) who suddenly walks in on her daughter and Zack making out and then all kinds of problems seem to surface
Jill Dunne has a husband who is always traveling or staying away from the home quite often
There are also big problems that occur when the family decides to go on a camping trip which their daughter Olivia dislikes and just cannot adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to be kept out all the bugs
In many ways, Olivia does an outstanding performance as the teenage and Nick Mancuso,(Richard Grant) gives a great supporting role as a hotel owner
This film will keep you guessing how it will end and you will enjoy a film filled with plenty of horror and terror
Stephen King was raised on flicks like this
<br /><br />Movies like this and 'Jeepers Creepers' are "throwbacks" to the good 'ol day drive-in horror flicks
They are meant to be fun, cheaply made and hopefully: a few good scares
<br /><br />Anyone looking for a theory on the human condition should pass on this creature feature because that's all this is
<br /><br />Stop trashing what has already deemed itself as trash
-Good, fun, trash!<br /><br />If you enjoyed this I recommend: 'Jeepers Creepers' 'Jeepers Creepers 2' '30 Days of Night' 'Scarecrows'('88) 'They Live' 'Planet Terror' 'Death Proof' and 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch
This afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw Neil Gaimans Stardust and all I can say is Wow
<br /><br />It is rare that I am completely taken aback by anything but this is quite possibly the greatest fantasy movie I have ever seen, maybe even the best movie of any kind and it is all Neil Gaiman's fault
<br /><br />Sure, I could have been sucked in by the wonderful dialog which was smart, flowed smoothly,and made the characters completely believable
<br /><br />I could go on for days about the spectacular acting, Charlie Cox is perfect as Tristan, Claire Daines is Brilliant as Yvaine, and Robert Di Nero almost steals the movie as the Deeply in the Closet Pirate Captian Shakespeare
<br /><br />The pure joy brought about by the humor which managed to be Laugh our Loud funny, Intelligent enough to make the first Shrek look like an 80's Sitcom, and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great movie
<br /><br />Special Effects were near perfect, true this was no LOTR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza but where they were use they were exactly what was called for, not too much to distract you from the movie itself and blended into the story perfectly
<br /><br />Then there is the story? What can I say
How often do you come across a story containing all of the classic fairytale formula components that doesn't just come off as another cheap Princess Bride knockoff
It manages to be Familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same time
<br /><br />Any one of those things would have made this a good movie, all of them combined make it a great movie but they pale in comparison to the rich enchanting world that those elements combine to bring to life well
Once again Neil Gaiman has done it, he has driven another dagger into my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that I would do almost anything to live in it and only given me a short glimpse into it
I didn't want it to end, I wanted to be sucked through a vortex to the land of Stormhold and get to meet Tristan and Yvaine in person, to travel it's fields and valleys, Stroll through it's marketplaces and meet it's residents both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever
It is a feeling that I have noticed whenever I have read anything by Gaiman, The Sandman, American Gods, Coraline all left me with a deep sense of sadness when I finished reading them because it was over, I could not see anything more into the worlds he had created which seemed to be so much more vibrant and alive than the one I am forced to live in and watching Stardust was no different
<br /><br />In the end I'm sure that Neil's writing and this movie won't have the same effect on everyone but trust me when I say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie, it is easily one of the top 5 movies I have ever seen and I can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it
The spoofs on other popular movies of that time were some of the funniest I have seen in this sort of movie
If you saw the movies that this movie is spoofing, and you get the humor, you should enjoy the movie
<br /><br />I (and the others who watched the movie with me) felt the funniest part in the movie (this is not a spoiler because I will NOT tell you what actually happens) was a scene with the "flashy thingy" from MIB
When they first discover the device and do not know what it is does
<br /><br />My only complaint about the movie is that I have never been able to find it in DVD so that I could buy a copy
It holds very true to the original manga of the same name, aka (Tramps Like Us in the U
S) but it can still be enjoyed even if you haven't read the manga
It's a different kind of tail, showing a strong and independent woman who hurts just like everyone else
However, because of her outward strength, she fears showing her inner feelings and thus let's those around her hurt her with their blunt comments
The only one who truly figures her out and who she can be at ease with is her new pet
If you want something different than the normal boring stuff with some wonderful J-Dorama (Japanese Drama) actors/resses then this is definitely the series to watch
wonderful movie with good story great humour (some great one-liners) and a soundtrack to die for
<br /><br />the american audiences are going to love it
Paul Lukas played a Russian intellectual making his living as a waiter in<br /><br />"Grand Slam," directed by William Dieterle (1933)
It is a surprisingly funny satire of the building up of celebrity
The waiter and the Russian restaurant's hat-check girl played by Loretta Young become America's sweethearts as bridge partners who do no squabble
With the aid of publicist and ghost-writer 'Speed' McCann (the wonderfully deadpan Frank McHugh) they become walking advertisements<br /><br />for the "Stanislavsky system," a "system" of bidding whatever one feels like<br /><br />(since bids are not rational, there is no basis for recriminations about their stupidity)
<br /><br />A duel with displaced bridge guru Cedric Van Dorn (sounds close to Goren, no? and I suspect the choice of the character's name "Stanislavsky" was also a slam at another kind of system), a puffed-up charlatan played very well by Ferdinand Gottschalk, is broadcast on radio stations across America like a prize-fight by Roscoe Karns (another great fast-talking deadpan comic actor of the 1930s)
<br /><br />The bridge players are even in a roped-off square, though the audience is<br /><br />above them, unlike in boxing "rings
"<br /><br />The wide variety of American types prefigures the comedies of Preston Sturges, though for manufacturing celebrity, "Grand Slam" most calls to mind two better movies from the same (pre-Code) era with Lee Tracy playing fast-talking<br /><br />publicists: "The Half-Naked Truth" and "Bombshell," but "Grand Slam" has its<br /><br />moments, especially for anyone who has played bridge with serious point<br /><br />counters
<br /><br />Loretta Young was already a clothes horse
(To me, her face seems a bit long<br /><br />and horsey, too
) The movie<br /><br />unfortunately all but drops Glenda Farrell, who plays McHugh's forgetful<br /><br />girlfriend
This film could have been a silent movie; it certainly has the feel of one
I was extremely, extremely lucky to see this very rare version of this film
Extase, is a 'symphony of love', and transcends all language versions
French, which is the ultimate romantic language, seems quite suitable for this very sensual and lyrical version
A young Hedy Lamarr lights up the screen, in this film which, in a way is almost like a sex fantasy; but definitely far from being pornographic
Tech qualities may have been a little crude; but that does not detract from the magical spell this film exudes
Many lovers of early cinema, would absolutely adore this film
The fully rounded character of the principal role of this movie, that of the cop torn up by his past and on a path of self-destruction so clear to the viewer, is unique for its time, 1950
<br /><br />Along with the haunting music and the well written plot, the film is a prime example of film noir at its best
Close-ups of Dana's eyes reveal the anguish within, Karl Malden excels as his boss, who brooks no nonsense but also has compassion for those under his command in the precinct
<br /><br />Otto Preminger made this type of movie just about his own
If there is any fault it would be with the breath taking beauty of Gene Tierney who seems oddly out of place with the hardened cop
Their scenes in the cafe, however, are wonderful and ring true
<br /><br />Tom Tully, in the bit part of her father is perfect as is Gary Merrill as the hood
The building where the deadly deeds take place highly atmospheric, I love the old woman in the basement
I haven't seen this movie in about 5 years, but it still haunts me
<br /><br />When asked about my favorite films, this is the one that I seem to always mention first
There are certain films (works of art like this film, "Dark City", and "Breaking the Waves") that seem to touch a place within you, a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive, that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer, not unlike a life-changing event, such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend
It left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days
"Dressed To Kill", is one of the best thrillers ever made
Its dealings with sex and violence make this a film for adults
Brian De Palma, once again, proves why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story
He directs many scenes without dialog, and he tells much of his story, strictly through the use of his visuals, and Pino Donnagio's brilliant score
Filmed in Panavision, the film MUST be seen in widescreen, as De Palma uses the entire width of the film to tell his story
Cropped, on video, "Dressed To Kill", is barely the same movie
Solid performances from its cast, superb direction, and, perhaps, the finest film score ever written, make "Dressed To Kill" a must see
Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid
I used to borrow the books from the school library every chance I got
My favorite one was "The Red Sea Sharks" - so much action and humor
<br /><br />This documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of Herge and his development of Tintin
The film-maker's personal experience in interviewing Herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the Chan character was very moving
<br /><br />A great documentary of a very talented and well-loved artist
A great example of someone who has become internationally renown, and has brought joy of millions of children (and the young at heart) all over the world
I just viewed Detention last night and i liked what i saw
He also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies
The story was ok and the other actors were also passable
I wouldn't call this movie his best but its still a good movie
<br /><br />But it also had its share of Problems
The first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target
They should've had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way
Another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing
I dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom
The third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers
Last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy , but that was due to the small budget
(Some One-liners were also cool)<br /><br /
This is the first Jean Renoir Silent film I have watched and perhaps rightly so since it is generally regarded to be his best, besides being also his first major work
Overall, it is indeed a very assured and technically accomplished film which belies the fact that it was only Renoir’s sophomore effort
For fans of the director, it is full of interesting hints at future Renoir movies especially THE DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID (1946) and THE GOLDEN COACH (1952) – in its depiction of a lower class femme fatale madly desired by various aristocrats who disgrace themselves for her – but also THE RULES OF THE GAME (1939) – showing as it does in one sequence how the rowdy servants behave when their masters' backs are turned away from them – and FRENCH CANCAN (1955) – Nana is seen having a go at the scandalous dance at one point
Personally, I would say that the film makes for a respectable companion piece to G
Pabst’s PANDORA’S BOX (1928), Josef von Sternberg’s THE BLUE ANGEL (1930) and Max Ophuls’ LOLA MONTES (1955) in its vivid recreation of the sordid life of a courtesan
<br /><br />Having said all that, the film was a resounding critical and commercial failure at the time of its release – a “mad undertaking” as Renoir himself later referred to it in his memoirs which, not only personally cost him a fortune (he eventually eased the resulting financial burden by selling off some of his late father’s paintings), but almost made him give up the cinema for good! Stylistically, NANA is quite different from Renoir’s sound work and owes a particular debt to Erich von Stroheim’s FOOLISH WIVES (1922), a film Renoir greatly admired – and, on a personal note, one which I really ought to revisit presto (having owned the Kino DVD of it and the other von Stroheims for 4 years now)
Anyway, NANA is certainly not without its flaws: a deliberate pace makes itself felt during the overly generous 130 minute running time with some sequences (the horse race around the mid-point in particular) going on too long
<br /><br />The overly mannered acting style on display is also hard to take at times – particularly that of Catherine Hessling’s Nana and Raymond Guerin-Catelain’s Georges Hugon (one of her various suitors)…although, technically, they are being their characters i
a bad actress (who takes to the courtesan lifestyle when she is booed off the stage) and an immature weakling, respectively
However, like Anna Magnani in THE GOLDEN COACH, Hessling (Renoir’s wife at the time, by the way) is just not attractive enough to be very convincing as “the epitome of elegance” (as another admirer describes her at one stage) who is able to enslave every man she meets
Caligari” himself, Werner Krauss (as Nana’s most fervent devotee, Count Muffat), Jean Angelo (as an initially skeptical but eventually tragic suitor of Nana’s) and future distinguished film director Claude Autant-Lara (billed as Claude Moore and also serving as art director here) as Muffat’s close friend but who is secretly enamored with the latter’s neglected wife! <br /><br />The print I watched – via Lionsgate’s “Jean Renoir 3-Disc Collector’s Edition” – is, for the most part, a lovingly restored and beautifully-tinted one which had been previously available only on French DVD
Being based on a classic of French literature (by Emile Zola, no less), it cannot help but having been brought to the screen several times and the two most notable film versions are Dorothy Arzner’s in 1934 (with Anna Sten and Lionel Atwill and which I own on VHS) and Christian-Jaque’s in 1955 (with Martine Carol and Charles Boyer, which I am not familiar with)
Lars continues the great combination of occult, dark horror and soap-opera drama
Picking up exactly where the last episode of the previous series left off(complete with the same high intensity and suspense, though that doesn't last; for better or worse), this installation in the franchise seems somewhat more bent on haste
in the last series, there seemed to pass a day or a week between each episode, whereas in this, it clearly is one long stretch
but he is very diverse and pretty eccentric
The plot continues its excellence, now giving a few regular characters that were minor players in the previous four episodes more attention
Basically every character from the first returns, at least as far as the main roles go
The pacing isn't as sharp as in the first part, and I found myself less gripped by this one
That is not in any kind of way to say that this didn't involve me, though
I still found myself constantly watching, and at several points reacting strongly, often out loud, to what was going on(extremely unusual behavior for me, as I am an incredibly silent person), as I also was during the first
Like the first, this also brings up some loaded ethical questions
Building on the foundation from the first, this brings the story further
and being a sequel, the scope is also bigger
More spirits, more bizarre occurrences, more subplots
The strong graphic material of the first also returns, and it's been kicked up a notch
The acting is amazing, as that of the first
Udo Kier solidifies his immense talent, to anyone who doubted it
Playing a very difficult character(anyone who has seen the first series can most likely figure out what I mean) *and* acting in a language he didn't speak(he was later dubbed)
and still handing in such a strong performance
The cinematography remains great, and is still very hand-held, with rapid zooms and the occasional long take
The editing is sharp, with a few direct cuts in sound(though these were more prominent in the first)
Now, with all that said, I would really like to be able to rate this a perfect 10
or at least just under, like the first four episodes
I truly enjoyed watching, and I don't regret it in the least
As the first, the humor just takes up too much space
There are several new regular characters that are there for no other reason than to provide comic relief
Scenes are set up and executed for no other reason than to make the audience laugh
Fine for a comedy, but what is it doing in such a dark and unpleasant, yes, nothing short of sadistic at times, horror piece? Helmer's solitary secret hiding place of solitude is changed from the hospital roof
from which he could see his beloved Sweden
In general, the humor seems more low-brow
more sex and bodily function jokes, which, again, begs the question "Why?"
Whilst most of the writing is excellent, some of it is downright dire
Several scenes are basically copied from the first mini-series(one would guess due to their popularity when it aired)
At times, the drama seems a bit more bombastic than that of the first, and it jumps too much at times
Fortunately seldom, but still noticeably, plot points and items are explained away too easily(a certain character living in Denmark for no apparent reason, for example
anyone who's seen it knows who I'm speaking of)
The two dishwashers, while still mysterious and insightful, become too much of a gimmick
Most of the scenes with them are still enjoyable, though
In addition to that, I want to reassure any reader of this that in spite of all the negative things I have just written that this is still mostly good
definitely enjoyable, compelling, powerful
and in my humble opinion, it should definitely be seen by anyone who liked the first(though if belong in that group; do not expect to feel that the story is finished after watching this any more than you did after the first)
I recommend this to any fan of Lars von Trier and anyone who enjoyed the first Riget and wants more where that came from
I urge anyone who's even considering watching this to make sure you've seen all of the first before you do
I bought this before I bought the first, but I held out on watching until I had bought the first and watched that, and I can't tell you how glad I am that I did
Though this features a brief summary of the events in the first, there are an immense amount of details and aspects that you would miss out on if you didn't see it before watching this
Slightly lesser sequel, but definitely still one to watch if you liked the first
I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is definitely interesting
It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it is a must for noir fans
Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect
My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films)
I think film noir works better with a short running time
Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested
Anyhow, as much as I like this film and the remakes, I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book
I watched this movie after watching Practical Magic, and the older film was far superior
I liked the way the lighting, makeup, and costumes changed as Gillian changed in the story
Jimmy Stewart's mannerisms didn't do a lot for me in this film, but I suppose they did serve to highlight the reserve of Gillian's character
I was also struck by Nicky's and Gillian's mannerisms--it was as if the director wanted him to appear effeminate and Gillian to appear masculine
The gestures Nicky makes when he's showing Redlich his powers especially struck me
I've never thought of warlocks as being effeminate, so it was an interesting way of contrasting those characters
I felt it necessary to respond to the comments posted on the front page of this film's page because some of it was slightly misinformative
<br /><br />Originally I posted quotes from the original poster, but I wasn't sure if it was proper given that this is the "comments" index and not a message board (though we used to use 'em that way back before IMDb added the film message boards) so I will edit this to make it unnecessary
<br /><br />Well, first of all you may not be aware of this, but Gene Kelly first became famous for playing "Pal Joey" on Broadway in the original production
When Vincente Minnelli decided to make a Gershwin "panorama" film, he wanted Kelly's character to be more sophisticated than the "goody two shoes" roles he had been playing in most his films (with the exception of "For Me and My Gal")
Alan Jay Lerner was instructed to construct a new story set in Paris based on the story of "Pal Joey"
This gave Kelly a chance to play his famous role from Broadway even though Warners had outbid MGM for the rights to "Pal Joey
" In my opinion, the WB film "Pal Joey" is a wreck, though Sinatra was suitable for the role, but other problems sunk the film (script changes and poor direction
===================================================<br /><br />You complain that Kelly's pictures are not well done, even citing your art education to prove the point
But you miss the fact that Kelly's bad art was clearly designed to be bad, and it is necessary for the story/characters
The pictures are so bad, the audience knows that Kelly isn't ready for an exhibition
Even he knows it, though Milo has sort of sugared him up to the point where he almost believes her
But it's important that the audience not be sitting there saying "but, he's a great artist, if he only had the chance!"
You want the audience to be fully aware of his deficiencies
<br /><br />Then you complain that he sabotages his interest in the show; again you are not understanding the structure of the story
He refuses because he doesn't want to feel like a gigolo, and because he knows he's not really ready for the exhibition
His enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not as great as "Joey's" enthusiasm to "start a nightclub"
But it serves the same function in the plot
Remember, it's essential in "Pal Joey" (the play) that Joey gives up his nightclub after he realizes that he doesn't deserve it
If Kelly's paintings were actually good, it would undermine this whole point
===================================================<br /><br />Then you complain that Caron and Kelly have no "chemistry"
I agree, the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be, but for me it was fine
Compare it to even worse "forced" romances like the one between Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in "The Pride and the Passion"
====================================================<br /><br />When you say that the big dance finale has nothing to do with anything else in this film, it just shows that you haven't dug beneath the surface of the film into its symbolism
Many elements in the dance sequence relate to the story and characters, and through the dance the plot is resolved through images and symbolism
It's about finding love, enjoying love, then losing love (he looks around and his love is gone)
The movements of the symphony are constructed so that part of each dance scene mirrors a separate phase of Parisian Art and also a separate phase of their relationships
If you didn't' see that, it's not the movie's fault
=================================================
It seemed as though the year 1984 was anything but the Orwellian nightmare it was calculated to be with George Orwell's science fiction novel!! 1984 turned out to be one of the happiest times in American history!! The upsurge in the economy, and a reemergence in basic American values, cultivated an idealistic aura of resumed innocence which was viewed by the American people with a very auspicious disposition!! There have been many ersatz renditions of classic movies in the past, but, the originals are almost always considered superior!! "Purple Rain" is such a movie in this category!! Made in 1984, "Purple Rain" provided a doggerel of eighties, happy-go-lucky quality music, which they incorporated into the making of this excellent film!! Certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed classics!! Screwball comedies, neon accented clothing, and of course, the music!! Eighties music is considered by experts to be the best decade for music in American history!! Set in Minneapolis, "Purple Rain" accommodated the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city
When I was a little kid, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, back then, the non-white population was under 3%!! By 1984, African Americans had made some in roads into Minneapolis, and, thus, they established a firmly embedded culture of their own as well!! The movie "Purple Rain" evokes an eighties style clothing, and music ensemble, which effortlessly captivated the movie audience!! I loved the music to "Purple Rain", and, the innovative approach this film takes to confrontational success, is indeed, brilliant!! See this movie if you have not seen it already!! Prince became an eighties icon with this masterpiece!! For a short time, he dated Kim Bassinger, he must be doing something right!! "Purple Rain" put Prince on the map!! This film gets my emphatically assertive verdict of THUMBS UP!!!
NYC, 2022: The Greenhouse effect, vanished oceans, grinding unemployment and scarcity of water, power and food
and New York's population has topped 40 million
This is a little gem of a picture, not least because a resource-depleted future is a reality for us 21st Century citizens
<br /><br />The low-budget opening titles of this movie are great: set to music, a low-tech 'tape-slide' sequence composed entirely of archive stills from the dawn of photography right up to 1973, depicts an unspoiled American pastoral developing into a polluted and crowded Hell in less than 2 minutes
Succinct and unambiguous, it's truly memorable
Budget limitations are also behind rather unimaginative cinematography and other constraints, at odds with the story's brilliant premise
The police station sequences are like an episode of some 70's TV detective show, and the other interior sets look basic at best
The budget probably all went on trying to 'futurise' the Soylent Executive's 'Chelsea West' apartment with state-of-the art goodies, meaning the other costumes are perfunctory, some establishing shots are bizarrely underpopulated and the daytime exteriors seemingly all shot through a smoke filter
<br /><br />The memorable scene where Sol and Thorn (Charlton Heston) share a meal of expensive and rare food neatly summarises their society: They enjoy real bourbon, lettuce, celery, tomato, apple, and beef, and we really sense their lip-smacking appreciation of someone else's wealthy privileges
<br /><br />Robinson's pivotal death scene, in which his character is willingly euthenased at a place called 'Home', depicts him immersed in images of the world's once-beautiful flora and fauna as he remembered them, beautifully contrasted with the jaundiced Thorn's dawning realization that the future has been bankrupted, among other horrors
<br /><br />This is one smart film, and its core message is as pertinent today as it was in the early 70s
Yes, I know we're not eating the dead yet, but with our resource-sapping longevity, spiraling poverty gap, corporate global capitalism and unchecked habitat destruction leading to climate change, the lasting prediction of 'Soylent Green' may come to pass
I think part of the reason this movie was made
and is aimed at us gamers who actually play all the Nancy Drew PC games
There's been a lot of movies lately based on video games, and I think this in one of them
<br /><br />So this movie does not follow any book
I buy and play every Nancy Drew games as soon as it comes out
And the games are from HerInteractive and are for "girls who aren't afraid of a mouse!" And some of these games actually won Parents' Choice Gold Awards
They are not only fun but you can actually learn a thing or two while playing
<br /><br />I took two of my step children with me to go see it and they loved it! The 10 yr
old had started playing her first Nancy Drew game a day before I took her to see the movie, and she was having so much fun playing the game I thought she would enjoy the movie as well
she not only loved this movie but couldn't wait to get home to finish her first game and start another one
<br /><br />My other step daughter is only 7 and she also loved the movie but she is still a little to young too play the games yet, but she enjoys watching her sister play at times just to see what's going on
<br /><br />The games are based for children 10 yrs and older
All the games usually get pretty descent reviews and are classified as adventure games
For more information on the games just check out HerInterative Nancy Drew games
So personally I thought the movie was pretty good and I will buy it when it comes out on DVD
Bill Paxton stars in and directs this highly original film
Having watched the first time I was by how good it was
As a result I was expecting an average thriller at most
However because of Paxtons excellent directing and acting the film is well worth watching , especially if you are a horror film fanatic
The film is also helped by the plot twists which keep coming until the closing credits
The films strongest point is the storyline which I have to say is highly original and is like I have ever seen before
Well done also to the 2 young leads which perfectly convey the emotions if these confused boys
I give this film 9/10 and I highly recommend that everyone catches it
:-)<br /><br />But who cares? I went to the theater to view the Shelby Cobra, Angelina & Cage
<br /><br />So I guess it was a good movie
A surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a doodle pad
A great cast mixing it up with an intriguing plot overseen by a Twin Peaks-ish influence in director Dahl
Nicholas Cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great portrayal of a man in a bind looking for the right thing to do
Walsh (RIP to a great actor) is always a wonderful villain, as is Dennis Hopper
It's such a shame he never made to a higher profile in the biz
In all, this is a great film that shows you that you don't need big bangs or a commercial soundtrack to be an entertaining film
I haven't watched the movie yet, but can't wait to see it! It seems very interesting and inspirational
It was one of the most interesting trailers I've ever seen: the questions it posed really stopped me and made me think, the unique approach to the sport of boxing as a metaphor for the "battle within"
thank god somebody is hitting another angle with the boxing thing
I especially enjoyed the short clip with the actor from the Rocky movies, really clever
I thought that the topic selected-overcoming adversities and childhood traumas-is timeless, and god knows a lot of people need it
Like most other reviewers I have first seen this movie (on TV, never on the big screen), when I was a teenager
My Dad has always regarded this film highly and recommended it to me then, and I must say he was not only right, but this movie has stayed with me forever in the more than 2 decades since I saw it first time
I have seen it two or three more times since then (just a few days ago I gave it another watch) and it has not lost anything of its impact with time
It still a great and well worth to be seen movie! Manr regard Peckinpah's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY as one of the first and best later western, which had a realistic look at life in the old west, but the hardly known LAST HUNT is definitely the better movie and was even half a dozen years earlier
Actually it was probably 3 decades ahead of its time, or maybe it still is
<br /><br />Although thinking hard and having certainly seen 100s of western (I like this genre) I can not remember any western as bleak and depressive as this one
Two men bound together, partly by hate, partly by not seeming to have other choices, surrounded by beautiful Ms
Padget, a crippled old man and a young Inian, leading the life of buffalo-killers until fate reaches out for one of them
<br /><br />Nobody who has ever seen this movie will be able to forget its ending and the last frames of this gem
When the camera moves on and away from Mr
Taylor a white buffalo skin comes into sight (on a tree)and echos from the past, when all the hatred began, are present again
Taylor has got his buffalo, but in the end the buffalo got him
<br /><br />Aside from the top performances of everybody involved, the intelligent script and the great dialogue, it should also be mentioned, that THE LAST HUNT is superbly photograped, I have seldomely seen a western that well shot (aside from the ones directed by Anthony Mann, which are also all superbly photographed), that all the locations are cleverly chosen and that even the soundtrack fits the picture very well
<br /><br />And director BROOKS is really a superb storyteller
Master craftsmanship!He has made quite a couple of really great movies and was successful in nearly every imaginable genre, but even in an as prolific career as this one, THE LAST HUNT still shines as one of his best, if not his best
<br /><br />Definitely would deserve a higher rating, compared to the 7-something RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY enjoys
The scene in the museum demands acting without dialogue
This is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of film
Dickinson's character Kate is very well developed and her performance is felt throughout the entire film
The best work Angie Dickinson did since Point Blank
I remember originally seeing this film at Radio City Music Hall when it came out
I didn't really understand the humor back then, but this movie can make me laugh out loud
<br /><br />With all due respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau really deserved the Oscar for this film
His performance is amazing--given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark
("You know what kind of songs he wrote? Sh*t!" and when speaking to the Spanish-speaking guy at the front desk: "No! No! No enchilada!!") Absolutely hilarious!<br /><br />Kudos to Richard Benjamin, who played straight man to Matthau
<br /><br />I just wish this was on DVD, because my VHS recording is getting a bit old
<br /><br />I had no interest in seeing the remake with Woody Allen, because in no way can it match the original
I saw this film a while back and it's still at the top of my 'favorite movies' list
It is amazingly put together and what really makes the film are the detailed tid bits (such as the 'Cafe Bustelo' coffee crate being reused as a cup to wash her grandsons hair) that people aren't seeing because YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU ARE HISPANIC
This is just one of those films that is very culturally specific and particular
Please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation it's being built upon
I completely see what the writer/director was going for, and he hit the target perfectly! This film is highly deserving of a better rating
Reading all of the comments Are very exciting
but can someone please tell me the name of the real artist that painted the pictures for the good times broadcast
as the artist in the family but, there was a real family that has the real artist, and he hasn't gotten any credit in this sight yet
So if you don't mind if someone can tell the name of the real artist I would also like to tell him "job well done"
I know this Sight is for the GOOD TIMES cast but, wouldn't you agree that he has also touched the hearts of us all
I would like to know if he still paints or, if he is still alive
I would like to have some of his work displayed in my home
Wow, I forgot how great this movie was until I stumbled upon it while looking through the garage
It's a kind of strange combination of a bio of Michael Jackson, a collection of musical vignettes, and a story about a super hero fighting to save some little kids
The vignettes are good (especially Speed Demon), but the best part of this movie is the super hero segment, in which Michael Jackson turns into a car, a robot, and finally a spaceship (and it's just as weird as it sounds)
Joe Pesci is hilarious, and has enough cool imagery and great music to entertain throughout!<br /><br />The real gem however is the incredible "Smooth Criminal" video, which makes the movie worth owning for that part alone
Wow I loved this movie! It is about normal life in a small village
About hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender
Great! It is about things everybody encounters in life
But some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you
There are people who find the opinion of others and 'what will the neighbors think' more important than to follow their heart
Don't let anybody's opinion stop you from fulfilling your dreams and passion
I loved the fact that the actors were all really normal people, it could have been my family
No big beauties, but all people you fall in love with during the movie
Old horror movies are interesting, plenty of screams, plenty of shouts, and plenty of humor to go along with it
Steve McQueen(1930-80) plays a teen who tries to be a hero in his town
Going out on a date with his girl is rather typical for all teens
But when the old man discovers the same falling object form the sky, he ends up being the victim, and Steve helps him out the best he can
When its up to teen power, this movie really provides it
I know most teens have had their hardships when they act up, when danger comes around, they must learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save humanity
When the adults in town ended up learn the hard way about "The Blob" running amok, they must learn to trust teenagers and not let their behavior get the better of them
The oozing juggernaut was rather cute in the day, and in my opinion I think it was JELL-O! When everyone pitches in to stop the menace, the town is once again safe, thanks to good old cooperation
I still eat Jello and watch this movie all the time, if you don't like Jello, TOUGH! RATING 5 STAR
I loved Dedee Pfeiffer (is that spelled right?) in Cybil
Haven't seen her for awhile and forgot how much I missed her
In some angles, the daughter even looked like a young Nicole Kidman
The abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists
I thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for sure
<br /><br />Just got the Lifetime Movie Network for Christmas and am loving these movies
Kept my interest and I'll watch it again when they rerun it
Can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this? You can post on the board or send me a private email if you want
I wanted to see Valentine ever since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were in it because they had played in some of my favorite movies ever
When I watched Valentine, I was amazed at how great the story line actually was
It kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not horrible at all
The actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and cunning
Some scenes were a little unbelievable and or poor, and I admit at a few minor parts it got just a small bit boring, but overall it was non-stop entertaining and suspenseful
It had a mind-twisting story line which made you guess the whole way through and it doesn't deserve all the crap it gets
I recommend this movie to watch anytime, but especially on Valentine's Day because it's sure to give you a ton of chills
Oh, and don't even pay attention to the trailer OR rating, please, DON'T
Pecker is another mainstream film by John Waters done on a smaller than Serial Mom
The title character of Pecker has a hobby of taking pictures of anything he sees
It doesn't matter if it's dirty or shocking when he takes pictures
He soon uses the pictures he taken and puts them on display at his work
Pecker live in a semi-normal middle-class family
His dad works at a drinking bar with a claw machine, but doesn't make enough money with a lesbian stripper bar across the street
His mom runs a thrift shop and loves to dress-up poor people
His older sister, Tina, works at a gay bar where her specialty is trade
His younger, Little Chrissy, has a habit of eating sugar, sugar, and nothing but sugary food
His grandmother, Memama, has a small statue of the Virgin Mary and plays ventriloquist with it
On of his friends, Matt is a chronic shoplifter and his girlfriend, Shelley, runs a laundry mat as if she was a dictator
Soon, a tourist from New York buys his pictures and displays them at an art gallery
With the picture comes fame, but the pictures expose the unusual life style of his friends and family's simple life
For an R-rated film, Pecker is sure tamer than most of Waters previous R-rated films and even Pink Flamingos
Two things haunt you throughout L'intrus (The Intruder): who's the intruder and is it a movie or a dream you're watching? The ending is so shocking that for a while you're at a loss for an answer to either of those questions
The intruder pops up as different characters, different men in different circumstances who don't belong in the scene, so they're expelled from it, kindly or brutally, but often without emotional involvement
The main character, Louis, is a contemptible man
He's got rough ways, some mean job and no heart
He has a heart transplanted and afterwards decides to start a new life
Can this man succeed in his quest for redemption? A guy like that could cut your throat at the drop of a hat
You know it but Claire Denis doesn't encourage you to judge him
Occasionally, there's a young Russian woman -a beautiful girl who seems to inhabit someplace between heaven and earth - who does judge him
There's the character played by Beatrice Dalle who wants no business with him: don't touch me, she says
But Denis lets this man be himself, films him in his self-absorbed quest
I don't know if what she films is the heart or the mind but it isn't the traditional plot basics
Whatever she films, you get it in the end
You know who's "the" intruder, you know why, more or less, and some scenes come back to your mind with their full meaning
The most satisfying element about "Dan in Real Life" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic
The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a superb decision; she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank goodness, appropriately aged for the part! Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster
<br /><br />Another wonderful aspect about "Dan in Real Life" is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the "frat pack" formula: dumb chicks, chauvinistic guys, and sleazy jokes
"Dan in Real Life" is witty and has fun, intelligent laughs throughout
Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from "Dan in Real Life" are more natural and clever, and involve some thinking on the part of the audience
<br /><br />My only problem with "Dan in Real Life" is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson
It's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director
Either way, her character is unrealistic and annoying
But, this is only a minor flaw in the film, and does not take away from the story as a whole
<br /><br />All in all, "Dan in Real Life" is a great film, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies
The quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) cinematography is excellent
It is simply a beautiful, light-hearted comedy
I was to young to ever know much about prince but in the past few years I've seen a lot of Purple Rain Novelty Tee's and i thought they were cool but i didn't want to buy a shirt i knew nothing about
So one Saturday it came on fuse and i decided to watch it
I didn't know what the movie was going to be about before i watched it but it was great once i found out
In the movie prince wasn't known as prince but as "the kid"
All the performances where great to me but my favorite were Purple Rain, Darling Nicki, and I would die for you
All the songs tied into what was going on through out the movie when his mother and father were always fighting the song when doves cried described what he was feeling
I also like how clever prince was with the way he flirted with Apallonia
I liked when Prince and Appallonia first met in the club and he stood behind her standing and then once she turned around he disappeared! great movie and now i cant even find one of those tee shirts :
I saw this pilot when it was first shown, and I'm sure countless "Spirit" fans hate it, because, like Batman, the Green Hornet etc
, it took the character in the direction of "camp"
But I evidently never got enough of Batman, because I thought it was entertaining, in some of the same ways as that show
First, when Denny's partner has been fatally wounded, and he makes a dramatic speech about how he always stood for the law, and obeying the exact letter of it
Then, he says something like, "Boy, was I stupid!" Which is his way of telling Denny to become a vigilante instead, which he does (though the TV Batman kind)
Then, there's the scene where he tries to seduce the villainess into letting him go by kissing her, but she isn't fooled, because he's too honest to kiss her convincingly ! This was a great example of "camp", that was also "underplayed", by both the actor and actress
I loved this show when it aired on television and was crushed when I found out that someone somewhere decided that it wasn't worthy of being continued! For years I hung onto my copies of this show, ones that I had taped or had someone tape for me
The powers that be finally decided to release this beautiful series on DVD and I finally was able to get my eager little hands on the complete set
Which, brings me to this part; the part about that this show is all about
<br /><br />American Gothic is about good verses evil, basically a struggle between Lucas Buck (that is Buck, with a B)
He is an evil sheriff of a South Carolina small town that runs things the way he wants things to be ran and stops at nothing to get his way
<br /><br />I felt the show was wonderfully written and directed and had lots of life left yet to be lived
I really hated when it was canceled, but that is the way it seems to go for me when I finally find something worth watching on television
<br /><br />Gary Cole did a great job as the role of Sheriff Lucas Buck, he has just the right amount of charm verses evil to pull it off
The other actors did a super job as well, so I guess you could say, even the casting was a hit with me
this is a wonderful film that I can watch over and over
It is definitely one of the top ten comedies made
With a great cast, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau wording a perfect script by Neil Simon, based on his play
<br /><br />It is real to life situation done perfectly
If you have digital cable, one gets the menu on bottom of screen to give what is on
It usually gives this film ***% stars but in reality it deserves **** stars
If you really watch this film, one can tell that it will be as funny and fresh a hundred years from now
Linking story: another first-time viewing for me and, again, this is one of the most popular of the Amicus anthologies - and it's easy to see why, though I realize how the film's rather meaningless title could be misleading for some; I certainly fancied director Peter Duffell's choice - DEATH AND THE MAIDEN (which, incidentally, is a classical piece by Schubert that is heard in the film during the Peter Cushing episode) - a great deal more
Though the linking device itself is not all that great, the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable
Production values come off as very respectable indeed for the budget Duffell had to work with
The latter infuses the film with a great deal of style which is not so common with this type of film and, frankly, it makes one regret the fact that he wished to distance himself from the genre (though more so as not to be typecast rather than because he felt it was beneath him)
<br /><br />Now to the individual stories themselves: <br /><br />"Method For Murder": the opening segment does not offer any real surprises but, to make up for this, it's quietly suspenseful and appropriately creepy at times (Tom Adams' 'fictitious' villain looking like the long-lost brother of Boris Karloff from THE OLD DARK HOUSE [1932]); also, it ends with a satisfactory DIABOLIQUE-type twist, and features a fairly intense role for Denholm Elliott in the lead
<br /><br />"Waxworks": for the second story we are introduced to a curiously romantic mood which is quite unusual for this type of film; Peter Cushing and Joss Ackland are both excellent (as well as impeccably dressed) in their roles of two jilted lovers of a woman who continues to obsess them even after such a long time, and whose friendly rivalry can only lead them blindly and inexorably to a fate that is literally worse than death; an ominous hallucination scene with Peter Cushing is quite well done in view of the limited resources at hand, and Ackland's inexplicable inability - or unwillingness - to leave town somewhat recalls the house-trapped aristocrats of Bunuel's THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962)
<br /><br />"Sweets To The Sweet": this is perhaps the finest episode of all - with his ambiguous role here, Christopher Lee continues to demonstrate his versatility and he is matched by an understanding Nyree Dawn Porter and the deceptive innocence of Chloe Franks (who appears as Lee's daughter)
The film's treatment of the occult here is both subtle and mature, culminating in a powerful and extremely chilling 'curtain'
Trivia Note: Chloe Franks appears as a grown-up in the featurette included on the disc, and when I saw her I felt an immediate familiarity with her face but couldn't quite put my finger on it
Later, on reading her filmography, it was revealed to me that she had played one of the leads in the long-running stage adaptation of Agatha Christie's "The Mousetrap" in London's West End, which my brother and I were fortunate enough to catch while we there on holiday in the Summer of 2002! Needless to say, we had no idea then that she had once created such a delicate - and delicious - portrayal in sheer evil, mainly by virtue of her peculiar look and a devilish smile!! <br /><br />"The Cloak": a wacky but oddly reverent vampire tale (that still manages to debunk many of the myths attached to the subgenre, while inventing some new ones!) which takes in some wonderful digs at exploitation cinema and, at one point, Christopher Lee himself!; Jon Pertwee is marvelous as the campy horror star who gets more than he bargained for when he attempts to bring a measure of authenticity to his work; Ingrid Pitt sends up her image nicely though her role is somewhat subsidiary to the proceedings; Geoffrey Bayldon (made up to look like Ernest Thesiger) also has a memorably quirky bit; the 'silent-cinema' style of the ending was a pretty audacious one to pull on an audience, I suppose - and, while some of the humor comes off as heavy-handed a' la THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS (1967) or THEATRE OF BLOOD (1973), it's also rather infectious and certainly ends the film on a high (and highly unusual) note! <br /><br />Video and audio quality are relatively satisfactory, considering I had no other version to compare it with; the main culprit is some noticeable print damage but this is never so nasty as to affect one's enjoyment of the film
As for the extras, beginning with the Audio Commentary: frankly, this is one of the finest chats about a genre film that I can remember listening to; Jonathan Rigby gets to butt in with his opinion more than is usual for a moderator but his effort certainly allows director Peter Duffell to touch on every aspect of the production (whereas with some other films, you're left rather expecting there to be more!) and, as such, it's an extremely pleasant track that complements the main feature very nicely indeed
The featurette "A-Rated Horror Film" is a worthwhile effort with Peter Duffell again at center-stage but this time backed up with valid, if all-too-brief, contributions from producer Max J
Rosenberg and stars Chloe Franks, Ingrid Pitt and Geoffrey Bayldon
We also get film notes, reviews, bios and a poster/stills gallery which, again, are wonderfully assembled (with the contemporary reviews being something of a novelty - and a welcome one at that)
Before Lost everything shown on TV was predictable
You could predict who was gonna die or who will find something, but in Lost you could predict NOTHING
Every thing was so surprisingly stunning and it really was a mystery not because it has so many secrets but because there was nothing like it before everything was so great
It gives you something to look forward to every week
The surrounding is brilliant it is calm and warm at the beach and so scary in the jungle
The characters are a work of genius every one of them especially the ones already on the island
The castaways are so dramatic yet we can never predict their deaths because they have so much more to do and so much more to say and they have secrets affecting the other castaways that die with them
I had just finished viewing it on EncoreW on DirecTV
I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought this was a good portray of what life is like as a professional wrestler
Now this film was made 4 years before I was born, but I don't think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling has changed all that much
Sad, funny, and all around GREAT!!! **** 10
I remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's the reason why i can still remember some parts of it)
I don't remember much about acting, nude scenes or other things but i do remember a male has head blown up with a grenade, a male dismembered over a tree and a male run down by truck and shot in head :) (Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland)
I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck
It's a movie that gives you the creep and it's worth a look
But where do i find it? How can i download it
A DAMN GOOD MOVIE! One that is seriously underrated
The songs that the children sing in the movie gave me a sense of their pain, but also their hope for the future
Whoopi Goldberg puts in a good performance here, but the best performance throughout the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the title character
<br /><br />This movie should have a higher rating
<br /><br />There's a coup d'etat and a couple of irish documentary filmmakers are right inside of it
<br /><br />A democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read the constitution is being slandered by the private media openly as dictator, mentally unstable, new hitler, etc
without repercussion from the governments side (like, say, silencing them via bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods)
Oh, and they still claim that they are being suppressed, of course
<br /><br />See how the media gloats about their own role in the coup d'etat on TV after they toppled the government with the help of rouge generals (how much more stupid can you get?? )
<br /><br />And see how the people of Venezuela march to the palace, holding the constitution in their hands, and reinstall their elected government
<br /><br />This sounds like a Hollywood fairytale, but it happened for real, against the explicit wishes of the USA
The documentary is a historical masterpiece, shot from the center of the action, acute and totally embarrassing for the prime supporters of the coup: The good, democratic, freedom loving, benevolent USA (who still channel large amounts of money to Chavez' political opponents)
<br /><br />Also highly entertaining and exciting
As entertainment value for 21st century viewers, it fails miserably
However, for the student of early sound films and history, it is a jewel
"Show of Shows" was a revue filmed to compete with MGM's successful "Hollywood Revue of 1929", which still survives intact complete with its Technicolor scenes
<br /><br />The purpose of the all-star revue was to showcase a particular studio's silent stars in speaking roles, and show that they could make the transition
seems to have forgotten this and employs many acts and stars that they didn't even have under long-term contract such as Ben Turpin, Lloyd Hamilton, Beatrice Lillie, and even a marching band
Meanwhile, their biggest talent - Al Jolson - is noticeably absent
Even at a high salary he could not be compelled to join in
Almost every act is overly long and the film plays like a dozen or so Vitaphone shorts strung together with no continuity
The finale is also overly long, but it is really enjoyable with all of its dance numbers
<br /><br />The highlights of the film are two numbers from Winnie Lightner - "Pingo Pongo" and "Singin in the Bathtub", a couple of numbers with Nick Lucas, John Barrymore performing Shakespeare, and the Chinese Fantasy "Li Po Li" with Nick Lucas and Myrna Loy
This last number is the only part of the film that survives in Technicolor, and it really is quite attractive
Reasonably enough, the players in these good acts were long-term Warner Bros
stars so perhaps the director knew how to play to their strengths since he was familiar with them
<br /><br />This film acts as a snapshot at an odd point in film history - the year 1929, which was the bridge year between two eras - the silent and sound eras, and the roaring 20's and the Great Depression
Just two years later this same film would have had an entirely different cast, as Warner Bros
would abandon its silent era stars and the stars they hired just to produce the early musicals in favor of those stars that gave Warner Bros
its distinctive urban look and feel - James Cagney, Joan Blondell, Edward G
I entered my first comment on this film almost five years ago
Then, the ideas presented in the movie still seemed mostly fictional, if indeed they could ever transpire at all
Now, the politics, society, and media in The Running Man seem very close to home indeed
<br /><br />Consider the following factors, which were mostly absent in 1987 (the year The Running Man came out) that are present today:<br /><br />Concern with, as Richard Dawson's character Damon Killian puts it, "traditional morality
" CHECK<br /><br />Entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear, and discomfort on the part of contestants
CHECK<br /><br />Restricted travel for citizens at the whim of the government, controlled by a centralized computer system complete with barcoded passports ("travel passes" in the movie) and sanctioned under the guise of national security
CHECK<br /><br />An increased intermingling, bordering on incestuous, of government and media
CHECK<br /><br />Computer-generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real film footage (such as the "digital matting" of Ben Richards' image onto the stunt double)
CHECK<br /><br />Jailing of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration
CHECK<br /><br />Flagging economy further widening the gulf between the wealthy and not-so-wealthy; increasing numbers of fringe groups reacting to the tightening noose of big government; civil unrest brewing just under or at the surface of nearly every sizable public event regardless of its origin or intent
CHECK, CHECK, CHECK<br /><br />Then again, maybe it's just a movie based on a Stephen King novella
But just to be safe, I'm moving to Switzerland
Let's start this review out on a positive note -- I am very glad they didn't decide to wimp out with Tony being shot and do a retrospective season like some people were rumoring
Actually, creator and writer of this episode David Chase did quite the opposite
We don't actually know if Tony will live or die
He's in a coma and his chances of recovering are very slim to none
This episode seemed to move very slow, and the coma induced dream Tony was in involving mistaken identity and robed Asian monks slapping the sh*t out of him was absolutely, flat-out weird
After 45-minutes I got a little sick of everyone grieving, but that shouldn' t be a reason to slam this episode
It was a weird and unpredictable episode, but it was still well-written and intense
Edie Falco gave an astounding career-defining performance in this episode as the conflicted wife having to face with her husband's could-be demise
I also found it interesting AJ dropped out of school and swore a vendetta against Junior, which AJ most likely won't have the balls to pull off
Silvio is now acting-boss which opens numerous doors to problems in later episodes
There were a lot of great quips in this episode, also, and I think Vito 'Pole-Smoker' Spadafore may meet his demise if he keeps being a greedy S
<br /><br />This wasn't a great episode and disappointed only because even though Tony kills people, we as an audience adore him and feel he is our hero of the show
This was a necessary episode for the series, even though it was a little snore inducing towards the conclusion
Kudos to Edie Falco's performance, and David Chase and the writers for creating this wholly original and unpredictable plot twist
This is the only season of 'The Sopranos' where I haven't a f*cking clue where it is going to go
5/10 <br /><br />Best Line of the Episode: (Paulie to AJ): "Let's go, Van Helsing!
College girl Joanne Murray takes on the unenviable job of readying the student housing building to become apartments,which includes selling the unneeded furniture This takes place during a break,so a mysterious psycho is stalking the nearly-empty premises on campus
"Dorm that Dripped Blood" is a low-budget slasher flick that is quite entertaining
The acting is pretty bad,the plot is predictable,but the gore effects are quite good
The film was made by UCLA film students Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow for next to nothing
Soon a dreamy ambiance kicks in,very similar to the enveloping forests of Jeff Leiberman's fantastic "Just Before Dawn"
It's great to see Daphne Zuniga of "The Initiation" fame run over few times by a car
I recently watched Caprica again and thought I might as well come and write up a review! I first saw this right after I saw the series finale of Battlestar Galactica ( Being a big drooling fan boy of the show left me clinging onto anything I could of the shows universe )so I didn't know what to expect
but I did come out with a smile though I must admit
<br /><br />The story starts off dramatically on planet of caprica and we are introduced with a variety of interesting characters
I won't give too much away but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of the story but I suggest you watch this
Esai Morales is one hell of an actor he pulled off a young Joseph Adama
(father of the Admiral in Battlestar Galactica)I found his acting spot on and I could believe that he is the father of William Adama from BSG
<br /><br />Also Eric Stoltz fits his role precisely
! Special note it was good to see Polly Walker outside of Rome! Don't sit down and watch Caprica with the expectation of it being like Battlestar Galactica because the story line is pretty straight forward and anyone can watch it
<br /><br />This show is a well written drama for those who like there drama with a bit of a sci-fi kick
I came in in the middle of this film so I had no idea about any credits or even its title till I looked it up here, where I see that it has received a mixed reception by your commentators
I'm on the positive side regarding this film but one thing really caught my attention as I watched: the beautiful and sensitive score written in a Coplandesque Americana style
My surprise was great when I discovered the score to have been written by none other than John Williams himself
True he has written sensitive and poignant scores such as Schindler's List but one usually associates his name with such bombasticities as Star Wars
But in my opinion what Williams has written for this movie surpasses anything I've ever heard of his for tenderness, sensitivity and beauty, fully in keeping with the tender and lovely plot of the movie
And another recent score of his, for Catch Me if You Can, shows still more wit and sophistication
As to Stanley and Iris, I like education movies like How Green was my Valley and Konrack, that one with John Voigt and his young African American charges in South Carolina, and Danny deVito's Renaissance Man, etc
They tell a necessary story of intellectual and spiritual awakening, a story which can't be told often enough
This one is an excellent addition to that genre
This movie had no parts that were hilarious, mostly just average funny units, but it did not have any parts that were really bad either
By about 5 minutes in I was sick of hearing him talk
Aside from the annoying sloth voice the movie was good
There were numerous side jokes which if you catch them make the movie much better
It has enough in it to keep adults content and enough in it to entertain kids
This one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them
Due to the nature of it you can see why it wasn't well received
It was unfairly panned because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself
Higher Learning is not spectacular but it was good film that tried to talk about a feared subject in America: racism
<br /><br />Plot/Story: Higher Learning is mostly centered around Malik(played by Omar Epps), a naive track star who is has to deal with not being fast enough, and a stern professor(played by Laurence Fishburne)
He befriends Fudge(Ice Cube) as well as a gorgeous lady named Deja(Tyra Banks)
Later on they end up having to deal with some skinheads on campus
Remy(play by Michael Rapaport) is confused kid who ends up befriending some local skinheads on campus
Once they impose their views on him, he becomes as racist as they are
<br /><br />Opinion: Higher Learning is not without its flaws: Character development is scarce, okay performances by Omar Epps, Tyra Banks and the leader of the skinheads(whose name I forgot), Busta Rhymes doesn't fit in this movie at all
Plus women turning gay after being abused by men was cliché' before this film so you know I didn't like that part of the film with Kristy Swanson
Other than that, this movie wasn't half bad
Laurence Fishburne was good as Professor Phipps(even though I could do without the accent), Fudge was Ice Cube's best performance and Michael Rapaport was good as the confused Remy
All in all it was one of John Singleton's best movies and is one is one of the reasons I frown on the rubbish he puts out now
Cinema needs more movies like Higher Learning, Mississippi Burning and American History X and less movies like Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious and a very pointless remake of Shaft
The scintillating Elizabeth Taylor stars in this lesser-known classic as a young girl from London who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from British Ceylon (current day Sri Lanka)
Upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd
William Dieterle, who also directed The Life Of Emile Zola and Portrait Of Jennie , does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark, and almost eerie, undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful I've seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery
"Chinese Ghost Story" is one of the most amazing Hong Kong films I have ever seen
It's a brilliant mix of fantasy,comedy,romance,horror and martial arts
The film has some wonderful visuals and amazing fights
I love especially the fight scene between Wu Ma and the tree demon tongue
Truly original and refreshing film and another Embalmer's fine recommendation
Julie Waters is outstanding and Adrian Pasdar a revelation in a very warm, very real, and extraordinarily entertaining look at the complications gender dysphoria and transvestism cause in a young executive's life
At the heart of this movie is the very real truth that you must accept yourself before you can hope for others to accept you
I tuned into this by accident on the independent film channel and was riveted
I'm a professional actor and I was flabbergasted by the performances
They felt totally improvisatory, absolutely without affectation
I could not tell if it was scripted or how it was shot and waited until the very end to see credits and then spent a half an hour on the IMDb to find this film
I see that the writer-director also did a very fine film called Everyday People which I enjoyed a lot
The shame of the film business is that projects this excellent do not get the distribution and advertising that they deserve and live under the radar
This film deserves to be flown high and proudly
If The Man in the White Suit had been done in America, can't you see either Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis trying on Alec Guinness's Sidney Stratton on for size?<br /><br />This is one of the best of Alec Guinness's films and certainly one of the best that Ealing Studios in the United Kingdom ever turned out
It's so perfectly fits within the time frame of the new Labour government and the society it was trying to build
It's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree
<br /><br />Alec Guinness this meek little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning, that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment
<br /><br />He's a persistent cuss and he does succeed
Of course the implications haven't really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society
In the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive, almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist
<br /><br />It's the mark of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films I've mentioned can be played for laughs
Poor Guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent, but it glows like a neon sign
<br /><br />Other than Guinness the best performances are from Cecil Parker as yet another pompous oaf, Joan Greenwood as his siren daughter and Ernest Thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the UK> <br /><br />Come to think of it, did Paramount borrow that suit from Ealing and give it to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever
People call this a comedy, but when I just watched it, I laughed<br /><br />only once
I guess the problem is that I first saw it when I was 14,<br /><br />and I wasn't old enough to understand that it wasn't meant to be<br /><br />taken seriously
There were quite a few scenes that were meant<br /><br />to be funny, but I cared too much about the characters to laugh at<br /><br />them
<br /><br />I suggest that you watch this film next time you're falling in love,<br /><br />and try to take it seriously
I think you'll find that, despite a few silly<br /><br />flaws, it's one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen
Myself and my groovadelic 20-something pals just can't get enough of this awesome Parker Posey CLASSIC! I tried renting this on DVD, but can't seem to find it - too bad, as I'm sure the features would be "extra special" !! :) We all highly recommend this uber-cool comedy flickerino for a date, or even just a cozy night home alone! This would also be the purr-fect type of movie to watch with your cat, or even throw a party based on, like a "Party Girl" party, just like the one in the movie that the lovable, huggable, squeezable Parker Posey goes to at the end
Oh, and be on the lookout for a gripping and HILARIOUS surprise ending
move aside, The Sixth Sense, you've just been outdone by a way radder movie! Sorry, no offense, just calling it like it is! Take it from an old flick lover, comedy just doesn't get better than "Party Girl" with Parker P! Feel it! Yours, Ronald Marie MacDougall (aka DJ Cyber-Rap
Actor Paxton made his directorial debut with this chilling, dark, and competently made thriller about a widowed mechanic (Paxton himself) who ropes his two sons into participating in savage ax murders, claiming that the victims are not human beings at all but "demons", and that they have been selected by God to destroy these "demons"
This is all told in flashback by one of the sons, now grown up (Matthew McConaughey) to skeptical FBI agent (Powers Boothe)
<br /><br />Hard to automatically forget this film; better than most serial killer features, it's a twisty and unsettling tale told in straightforward fashion with a bare minimum of cinema gimmicks
Paxton, commendably, barely shows any blood at all until near the end
Well acted by all, especially the two child actors (Jeremy Sumpter of the recent "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary of "Spy Kids 2" and "Domestic Disturbance")
The only reason I deducted any points at all is because I can understand that some people may find all of this hard to stomach
In any event, it's an atypical thriller with a decent script
Right from the start you see that "Anchors Aweigh" is a great comedy
Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a funny team! The songs they sing together are pure entertainment
Kathryn Grayson is gorgeous and really sweet
Dean Stockwell is the cutiest child actor I've never seen
If you are fond of piano, you'll be amazed by José Iturbi
This movie was the first one to combine animation with real actors and it did that wonderfully in an unforgettable dance number
Undoubtedly one of Kelly's funniest movies
One of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes
And the next day we were in the supermarket at Hollywood Blvd
and La Brea, my father and I, and guess who was coming toward us in the aisle! Barney Phillips, but no hat on -- at least, I don't think he had a hat on
<br /><br />We asked him about his third eye, and he said something like he left it at home, and everybody he met that day had asked him about it
We used to see all kinds of character actors in LA in those days
<br /><br />BTW, I was a teenager and it took a long time for me to get over the "three hands" on the other alien! <br /><br />Robyn Frisch O'Neill <br /><br />Hollywood native and resident 1947 to 1963
Obviously a film that has had great influence not only on the buddy genre but action genre as well
George Lucas had to be a fan of this flick as so much of his Star Wars series seems to a homage to Gunga Din
The characters that Grant, McLaglen, and Fairbanks play are just precursors of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca
Even Sam Jaffe's Gunga Din morphed into C-3PO and R2-D2 and like him or not: Jar Jar Binks
<br /><br />Today this film is viewed as non PC but there is a speech by Eduardo Ciannelli as Guru the leader of the Indian opposition to the British raj that could can be echoed in the sentiments of many today
<br /><br />To a young boy this was a great film
Three strong male leads and only a hint of romance
There was a time when young boys deemed kissing the girl in Saturday matinee film was just mush
Not like today when the more skin is greeted with delight
<br /><br />Hopefully this film will not be forgotten and a few who are channel surfing will stop at TCM and catch a film with action, adventure, and a cast of thousands instead of CGI actors
The most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, guineas artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds
As a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing
The enormous support that Christy got form his family, low-income, working class Dubliners, encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book, but the dialogs were written wisely to capture Christy Brown's witty arrogant personality
I do recommend this movie to everyone, especially to classic movie-lovers
~~I was able to see this movie yesterday morning on a early viewing pass~~<br /><br />I am a mom of 2 children, who range from 11 down to 6
So I'm sure plenty of parents can relate to having to see many many "kids" movies
I haven't read this particular book, so I don't know if it stayed true to the book or not
But it sure took the grossness factor to a high level
This is the story of the "new" kid in town and it just so happens that there are a group of boys who have formed a club of sorts and love to pick on kids
sound familiar? Haven't we all suffered this one time or another
He has the little brother who he cant stand and parents that he is embarrassed about
What I enjoyed most of all was seeing how each character was totally different from another they all stood out
The bully (why do they always make the bully a red head? My daughter has red hair! and she is no bully!
lol) is well a great bully, who finds himself being yelled at by his own big brother
It took twists and turns and well you fall in love with all of them and really find yourself routing for all the characters! Even the parents, great connection between father and son
All around enjoyable, sweet,funny, gross etc
Take your kids!!! You will enjoy it as much as they do
Yesterday, I went alone to the cinema, because here in Mexico, most of the times movies from other countries are part of the so called "camára alternativa" (alternative camera)
But after I saw this movie, I realized that not all the foreign movies are alternative
But I have to said that I enjoyed so much this movie
this movie is a little spoon of hope in these days
This is a good option to see a good movie in Spanish
Cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena
Why a stupid, boring, crappy overrated film series like "Star Wars" gets all the hype, and a truly amazing film like this one goes completely un-noticed
This movie will really open your eyes to the dark, disturbing, sad, and scary world we live in
<br /><br />Unlike the boring "Elephant", this movie isn't one of those "just a typical day until someome pulls the trigger" movies
this movie focuses more on what happens AFTER the event
<br /><br />Deana, played by the very hot and very talented Erika Christensen, is a happy and healthy straight-A student with great friends and a great life
she is injured on the day of the shooting, by being shot in the head
Luckily she is not killed, but is severely injured and has to be in the hospital for a while, causing her to be in a lot of emotional pain, in addition to the physical
<br /><br />Meanwhile, Alicia, played by the also very gorgeous and talented Busy Phillips, is a nasty, cold-hearted, rebellious, anti-social goth girl who doesn't have a single positive trait on her
and she is unharmed when the shooting happens
because it turns out, she was FRIENDS with the shooter and knew he was going to do what he did
which causes her to be brought into the police station and be asked some questions
When she refuses to tell the cops if she knew the shooting was going to happen, they constantly come by her house to try to convince her to say something
and she still doesn't, so the principal of the school makes her attend a funeral of one of the dead students, and after she walks out on that
the principal decides enough is enough, and forces her to go visit Deana in the hospital
Of course she refuses this too, but the principal says that if Alicia doesn't do this, the cops are going to continue to try to get her to say something
<br /><br />The lonely, traumatized, and both physically and emotionally wounded Deana is more than happy to have someone visit her, but of course, Alicia is anything BUT happy to be seeing her
Deana attempts to give her a friendly welcome, but of course, Alicia responds with nothing but harsh and hurtful comments and a harsh statement on how she is only here because she is being forced, and has no intention of being friendly with her at all
But sooner or later, that intention will change
(and that's all I'll say :) This is truly one of the most moving movies ever, as well as one of the most dark and disturbing
Actually, I think I would tie this with "American History X" as equally disturbing and moving at the same time
<br /><br />WARNING: Watch this movie at your own risk!! It contains VERY graphic scenes and images! EXCELLENT and criminally under-appreciated movie! I feel so ashamed that I'm pretty much the only one that knows about it
This film was absolutely BRILLIANT!! Every performance in this film is excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper
It looks like Mr Gyllenhaal will have a HUGE film career if this is anything to go by
I thought that Joe Johnston was an odd choice as director as he is usually associated woth big budget blockbusters(Jumanji, Honey I shrunk the kids)
My favourite scene was where Homer is going down the mineshaft and looking at the sky, going down, as all of his dreams were, it was beautiful
Joe Johnston should direct more of these brilliant, acting driven films as well as his Big budget blockbuster faire, which is also excellent
KUDOS!! to all involved in this masterpiece
This movie (and yes, it's a movie - it was shot as a two-parter, but the two parts together come down to slightly more than 2 hours) is one of the unsung masterpieces of world cinema
A very well-mannered, and yet at the same time absolutely savage denunciation of the Soviet regime and the type of person who flourished under it, the film is a faithful adaptation of the long-banned eponymous book by Mikhail Bulgakov
The sets are flawless, and the director made the brilliant decision to film in monochrome sepia, adding a feel of authenticity where a late-80s washed-out color incarnation would have all but ruined the film
I won't say much about the plot, which deserves to be discovered by the viewer himself, but the performances are true Oscar material; special mentions go out to E
Evstigneev, who plays the old professor with such presence, gravitas and kind wisdom that with barely a word or a gesture, he ends up stealing every scene he's in
The second, of course, is Creature/Sharikov, who, played to horrifying perfection by V
Tolokonnikov, is by far more frightening a character than Hannibal Lecter, because not only does he exist in real life - entire countries have been ran by men like him throughout history, with all that ensues
<br /><br />While it's a socio political allegory, it is worth mentioning that the movie is also brimming with humor, albeit dark - there are many outright comedies which haven't made me laugh as much as this film
What's more, when laughing at this movie, the feeling is not only one of hilarity but of understanding and agreement, which is always a plus
<br /><br />There is hardly a complaint I have with this movie - the only slight flaw is the tone of intellectual/bourgeois snobbery I caught at times from the "enlightened" characters
<br /><br />Sadly, this film appears to have been bypassed by Western licensing companies
It's a crying shame that one of the all-round best movies out there is languishing unrestored and untranslated (which shouldn't be incredibly hard - though all the cultural references and the revolutionary terminology will necessarily fade in translation, the film's main themes should be accessible to all)
While we're waiting with our fingers crossed for the Criterion edition, I'm considering creating English subtitles myself
This movie has great stars in their earlier years: Ingor Stevens never looked prettier; Yul Brynner was a very convincing Jean LaFitte, conflicted about his piracy and desiring to keep neutrality with the United States
Charlton Heston did a pretty good job as Andrew Jackson, but some moments were a bit stilted
It's really a good flick for students to learn that part of our history, AND it shows that all happy endings do NOT include the lovers getting together with each other--sometimes the happier ending is that they sail away and find partners of similar background who will understand them better in the long run
I have viewed it every year at least twice for 16 years now; and though it is not the best movie I've ever seen, I love it every time
John Waters' tribute to the people he loves most (Baltimoreans) is a twisted little ditty with plenty to look at and laugh at
It's like being turned loose in a museum of kitsch! I haven't laughed so much in a theater since Serial Mom
I loved seeing old friends from the Dreamland days, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, back in front of Waters' camera
The cast is simply wonderful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton)
Uses the best elements of past Waters atrocities (especially the underrated Polyester) and plenty of new surprises
I haven't read through all the comments, but at least one poster mentioned that the 30 minute version might possibly be abridged
I'm curious about that myself because the later parts of the film just didn't make much sense to me even when I rewatched them
30 minutes seems really short for a movie in 1917 also
"Poor Little Rich Girl" which was Tourneur's next film is 65 minutes long and "Pride of the Clan" which was his previous feature was 84 minutes long
So I'm relieved to see that I wasn't crazy, there must be part of this film missing and that's why the resolution didn't make much sense
<br /><br />It's hard to review or comment on a movie that you're only able to see half of
but I would recommend this film anyway because of the really fascinating view that it provides us of the insides of an East Coast movie studio of the time
It's the earliest film I've personally seen that's based on the movie industry itself
The main character is a movie star played by Robert Warwick, who was later a mainstay Hollywood character actor and appeared in almost all of Preston Sturges' films
He plays a western actor perhaps vaguely modeled on William S
After the really fascinating sequences set in the studio we see them on a location shoot where he discovers a country girl (Doris Kenyon) and convinces her to come to New Jersey for a screen test which goes very poorly
After that point the movie seems to be missing major pieces in the form we have now
<br /><br />Again, I'd recommend it to anyone who's interested in film history for the documentary value, but in the form we have it doesn't hold up much as a movie and isn't a particularly good example of Maurice Tourneur's work
An old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat
He wanders the woods to witness a murder but did he see the murder or is he losing his mind? Is he just getting old? The movie so great because the viewer has to make up their own mind on what is going on
There is very little dialog in this movie but it doesn't need words, the whole movie speaks for itself
You knew what was going on and I liked it
<br /><br />The other part that I liked were the shots of the woods in late fall and winter
Those were pretty but the only thing I didn't like was the view of the old man in his underwear
He could have tied the robe a little tighter but other than that, it was a pretty deep movie
Being that I am not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, that made me even more anxious to check out this flick
I remember he was interviewed on "Jay Leno," and said that he turned down a role in the big-budget Adam Sandler comedy "The Longest Yard" to be in this film
So obviously, Snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops
I'm not going to overpraise Snoop for his performance in "The Tenants
" There are certainly better rapper/actors, like Mos Def, who could've done more with his role
He can't seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections, but that's something even Jack Nicholson has a problem doing
The point is I found him convincing in the role, and the tension between him and Dylan McDermott's character captivating
McDermott, by the way, gives the best performance in the film, though his subtle acting will most likely be overshadowed by Snoop's not-so-subtle acting
Being a big reader and aspiring writer myself, I couldn't help but find the characters and plot somewhat fascinating
It did aggravate me how Snoop's character would constantly ask McDermott to read his work, and berate him for criticizing it
But you know what? I'm sure a lot of writers are like that
His character was supposed to be flawed, as was McDermott's, in his own way
My only mild criticism of the film would be its ending
For some reason, it just felt too rushed for me, though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters, rather than plot
Personally, I find the movie to be quite a good watch
It outlines the actual situation of triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized
<br /><br />Not only that, it also shows the viewer how the Hong Kong police control the triad situation and why the police don't just go all out and wipe out triads
<br /><br />Overall, the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings & torture
Nevertheless, the movie stays true to the real world, thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens
<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie to any Triad/Mafia movie fan
That movie has more guns than this, as in this movie there's more knives than guns (in fact I don't remember seeing a single gun)
To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that- simply the best film ever made
<br /><br />From beginning to end it oozes class
It is stimulating, thought provoking, a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoples
<br /><br />The cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and Technicolour to accent the different worlds works seamlessly
The characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable fantasy
<br /><br />No matter how many times I watch the film - and I have watched it a lot - it never fails to touch me
It makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it makes me think, it makes me cry
<br /><br />If I were allowed just one film to keep and watch again A Matter of Life and Death would be that film
Pendragon Pictures' new film "H G Wells' War of the Worlds", the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been in development for about 5 years
A theatrical release was intended for earlier this year (March, 2005) but this never happened
The DVD was rushed out to coincide with the release of Spielberg's version, which hits theatres June 29
<br /><br />I liked this film, with certain reservations
<br /><br />How faithful is the adaptation? It's not quite 100% faithful to Wells' book, but 90 - 95% faithful is good enough for me
At least several scenes were totally new, such as Ogilvy the astronomer's confrontation with a farmer, and the unnamed writer/narrator awkwardly having tea with his cousin
But on the whole, this film follows the book very closely -- certainly much more than the classic 1953 version by George Pal
<br /><br />Its greatest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget
The majority of it seems to have been shot blue-screen and composited with digitally rendered backgrounds
This is particularly annoying during most of the interior shots, and scenes of crowded city streets
The overviews of 1898 London look like something from a video game
Numerous scenes in horse-carriages were faked -- I guess they couldn't afford to rent a horse
The only scenes shot for "real" seem to be those in open fields or forests
<br /><br />But within those budget restrictions, they managed to do quite a lot
The Martians and their tripods are quite well done, and very true to Wells' descriptions
I was particularly impressed with the heat ray
Although the Thunder Child sequence, which should have been one of the film's highlights, is very disappointing
It's a great shame that they couldn't afford more actual sets, or better quality animation
<br /><br />The acting and direction won't win any Oscars
For the most part, they are competent, not bad, but not outstanding
The music is quite good also, though not on a par with any of the major Hollywood composers
<br /><br />I'm actually glad this didn't get a theatrical release, because the budget limitation would have made it look much worse on a big screen
As it stands, I would rate this similarly to a BBC-TV adaptation of classic literature
<br /><br />A few nitpicks: Most of the scenes are presented with various colored filters (mostly red)
This may have been an artistic choice, but it is used very inconsistently, and seems more like a sloppy job of mastering the DVD
And the writer/narrator's obviously fake moustache mutates from scene to scene
<br /><br />Bottom line -- Is it worth seeing? If you can look past the technical and budgetary limitations, and get into the story, I think you will enjoy this, especially if you've actually read the original H G Wells novel
If, however, you are easily put off by cheap production values, you'd best pass on this (unless you're a MST3K fan)
Be warned, however that the film runs a full 3 hours, so I don't recommend watching it all in one sitting
<br /><br />BTW: An entirely different version of War of the Worlds (aka "INVASION") came out on DVD the same month that Spielberg's hit the theatres: http://imdb
This was also made on a budget, but is updated to the present day like the Spielberg film - but it's much better! And to top it off, Jeff Wayne is making an animated film of his best-selling album from 1978, but that won't be out until 2007
I was watching this movie on Friday,Apr 7th
I didn't see the last scene ( cos I was talking with my bro n Mom in law at the same time )
Anyone can tell me what happened to her?I watched slightly that her husband was hearing someone was talking to his wife in the bedroom and then he opened the door,she's dead already
<br /><br />What happened to her? Did she kill herself? How could she arrange everything like the phone calls,meanwhile she's at home when her husband was talking to this strange admirer?Anyone can explain to me,please
I am so so curious!! ( in the end,I read that she suffered from Multiply Disorder Personality )
Nifty little episode played mainly for laughs, but with clever dollop of suspense
Somehow a Martian has snuck aboard a broken-down bus on its way to nowhere, but which passenger is it, (talk about your illegal immigrants!)
All-star supporting cast, from wild-eyed Jack Elam (hamming it up shamelessly), to sexy Jean Willes (if she's the Martian, then I say let's open the borders!), to cruel-faced John Hoyt (the most obvious suspect), along with familiar faces John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a nice turn from Bill Kendis as the bus driver)
Makes for a very entertaining half-hour even if the action is confined to a single set
this is a film about life, the triumph over adversity and the wonders of the human spirit
I defy anyone not to shed a tear by the end of the movie
This is more than just a tear-jerker, its an engaging, thought-provoking drama with excellent performances from all the cast but especially derek Luke and denzel washington
7 years on, I'm amazed that Luke is still a virtual unknown and washington only directed one other film
Nevertheless, apart from a slow build-up, the story of this foster child's trials and tribulations and how it still affects him in adulthood is the sort of movie that stays with you long after you have seen it
Like many fox searchlight pictures, this was more of a sleeper hit and didn't get the mass critical acclaim it deserves
The scene where Antwone finally meets his mother summed up the movie for me, there were so many ways that could have been done and it could have been all schmaltzy or it could have been unrealistic but Washington struck exactly the right tone, his mother never said a word and could only shed a tear, while antowne asked simply why
Her overwhelming guilt prevented her from saying anything, what could she say to defend herself? One of the most moving cinematic scenes I have seen
Pure Orson Welles genius makes this one of the greatest of movies
Welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy, which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment "big dummy that I am
" Plot is so complex that I still don't know whether the victim knew that his life was about to be lost
The shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most amazing ever filmed
That scene alone is worth the price of admission
This is the only time that Rita Hayworth ever played a complex yet believable character
No one but Welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and dye it brassy blond
Thirty years after its initial release, the third version of "A Star Is Born" finally comes to DVD in a package that should please the most devoted fans of Barbra Streisand
That would include me since I just saw her in concert singing among other numbers, the feminist anthem "Woman in the Moon" from this 1976 film
Easy to dismiss, the movie's career-polarizing story is such a sturdy pile of Hollywood-style clichés that variations of it exist in other films including Streisand's own "Funny Girl"
This time reset to the then-contemporary music scene, the timeworn plot follows self-destructive rock star John Norman Howard on his deep-dive career descent just as he meets club singer Esther Hoffman who is awaiting her big break
<br /><br />Troubles dog their courtship from the outset, as John Norman (both names please) responds to grasping fans and bloodless DJs with random acts of violence (from which he inexplicably escapes prosecution)
To John Norman, Esther represents his last shot at happiness, and in turn, she is drawn to the innately decent, creative musician underneath the façade
In the movie's most pivotal scene, he gives Esther her big break at a benefit concert, and her career takes off
Inevitably, he can't handle the failure of his career in light of her meteoric success, and if you are familiar with any version of this story, you know the rest
Directed by Frank Pierson (although Streisand's budding directorial talents are obviously on display), the film still manages to draw me in, even though I know it is shamelessly contrived and manipulative
It still has a certain emotional resonance despite its numerous flaws
<br /><br />Although Streisand in her prime seems like the ideal choice to play a rising singing star, her screen persona is simply too strong and predefined to play Esther credibly
The same can be said for her performing style since the script seems to make allowances for her softer Adult Contemporary-oriented material to be accepted within the otherwise hardened world of arena rock
From the moment she pops her head up as the middle of the Oreos, she can't help but come across as an established star
I can forgive the lapse simply because she is an unparalleled vocal talent, but what becomes less forgiving is how she makes Esther more strident than poignant when John Norman's woes become overwhelming
This creates an oddly discomfiting dynamic in the last part of the film when it becomes less about what caused the climactic event than Esther's response to it
This is capped off by an uninterrupted eight-minute close-up of her memorial performance - great except when she regrettably mimics John Norman's style toward the end
<br /><br />Kristofferson, on the other hand, gives a superb performance throughout, managing a level of honesty that grounds the film and makes palpable his concurrent feelings of love, pride and resentment toward Esther
He makes his vodka-soaked onstage growling work within this context
Otherwise, what always strikes me as strange about this version is how all the supporting characters are relegated to the background as if they didn't exist unless they were interacting with the two principals
The only ones who register are Paul Mazursky as John Norman's level-headed manager Brian and Gary Busey as his cynical band manager Bobbie
Veteran cameraman Robert Surtees provides a nice burnish to the cinematography though a level of graininess persists in the print
A big seller in its day, the soundtrack is a hodgepodge of different styles from the 1970's - some songs still quite good ("Everything", "Woman in the Moon", "Watch Closely Now"), some that have moved to kitsch ("Queen Bee", Kenny Loggins' "I Believe in Love") and of course, the inescapable "Evergreen"
<br /><br />The print transfer on the 2006 DVD is clean and the sound gratefully crisp thanks to digital remastering
Streisand's participation is the chief lure of the extras beginning with her feature-length commentary
She gives insightful information about the genesis of the film, the casting and the reportedly troubled production
She is also refreshingly candid about the megalomania of Jon Peters, her hairdresser boyfriend who became the movie's producer, and her dissatisfaction with Pierson as a director
I just wish she could have provided more scene-specific comments that directly relate to what is on screen
She also tends to repeat the same anecdotes when the mood strikes her, e
, it gets tiring to hear for the third time how the person playing the chauffeur was a friend of Peters
I think having a second commentator could have drawn out other nuggets from her
<br /><br />There is a wardrobe test reel that shows some amusing 1970's clothes, especially Kristofferson's mixed-fabric poncho and orange polyester shirt
There are also twelve deleted scenes included with Streisand's optional commentary
One is a comic bread-baking scene which reminded me how much I like Streisand in farcical comedies
Another is an extended scene in which she plays "Evergreen" on the guitar in front of an awestruck Kristofferson who then falls asleep
The most interesting is an alternate take on the musical finale incorporating fast cuts, which I agree with Streisand should have been used
Fittingly, the theatrical trailers for all three versions of "A Star Is Born" are also included
A must see film with great dialogues, great music, great acting and a superb atmosphere
<br /><br />In the film you will follow 8 people for one day in the city of antwerp, they are all individuals and sometimes plain weird (that's how I love them!)
<br /><br />I'm not going to say anything else, just go see and enjoy it
As soon as I heard about this film I knew I had to check it out
Well, I heard about it, then I found the trailer
After that, that's when I knew I had to see it
You want to see classic television mixed with zombies? No? Then get lost
<br /><br />FIDO is a movie unlike anything I've ever seen
It's kind of like a Lassie episode and a Zombie film
Though when combined, it feels completely new and original
FIDO is about a little boy named Timmy and his new pet Fido
Well this new pet ain't no squawking parakeet or some potty-trained puppy
A large radiation cloud engulfed Earth which led to all of the dead rising, which ensued the Zombie Wars
Though through the genius of Reinhold Giger, lead scientist of ZomCon, he discovered that if you destroy the brain, the zombie will perish, thus giving us the edge and the win in the Zombie War
Though due to lingering radiation, whoever dies becomes a zombie
Which can be a problem especially with the elderly
Though Zomcom steps up again with more breakthroughs, especially with the Domestication Collar
The collar stops the zombie's need for human flesh and thus making it harmless as a household pet
But not all is perfect in this Zombie Utopia, collars break, old people die and
well I'll just let you watch this incredibly unique flick
<br /><br />FIDO is a fantastic idea brought to fruition
With an all-star cast, and great writing FIDO rises above most in the comedy/horror genre
There are plenty of funny and original situations that really had me entertained
Though after seeing the film, I personally think the movie would have been better in black and white
At less than 90 minutes, the movie doesn't go on for too long and moves from scene to scene at a good rate
It'll probably end up being a cult-classic of sorts, since it's not really a laugh out loud comedy or even a horror movie
It's a comedy/family/zombie film immersed in the 1950 vibe
If you thought anything I said here was interesting by all means check this film out
But if you're still on the fence, swing your leg back over and stay there
Fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race
All falls apart though, when young Timmy's zombie Fido eats the family neighbor
From then on, disaster (well, maybe not disaster, but to some extent, chaos) occurs
Most of the people treat their zombies with fairness, and one such character sleeps with his zombie (very funny part of the movie, if not also very disturbing too)
And we find the loving Fido whatever he may do
This is a very funny and unique film, especially for the zombie genre
It is also probably one of the least violent of zombie movies (no negativity in this statement)
I very much recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different
I really enjoyed this episode, which was a great surprise given the bad reputation it seems to have acquired
From a pure writing perspective, 'The 16mm shrine' is an absolute treat, with fantastic dialogue and character analysis, typical of Sterling
In particular I really enjoyed the philosophical indulgences of the episode, tackling themes of existence and reality, whilst balancing it with more psychological topics such as denial, pride, and desire
'The sixteen-millimeter shrine' is an episode about how these ideas based around an unwillingness to accept change can seemingly alienate a person from the rest of the ever-changing world
It is also a fantastic example of cerebral Twilight Zone; one that explores the mind rather than the world outside it
These elements all come together very nicely to create a thought provoking and incredibly interesting 25 minutes
<br /><br />The episode is not without its faults however, which mainly lay in Lupino and Leisen shoes
Ironically, I felt Lupino was unconvincing throughout, with only a few scenes that could count as memorable
This of course being an absolute shame considering how well Sterling had written her character
Furthermore Leisen didn't seem to know what to do with most of his characters, sometimes having them stand around on set doing next to nothing -which probably explains why accepted the poor performances from Lupino half the time-
Thankfully Balsam does a good job of covering up a lot of weak spots, helping redeem the show from an acting perspective at least
<br /><br />As I said previously however, if you're a fan of classic film and cerebral science fiction, this shouldn't be as bad as it's sometimes made out to be
In addition to the writing that I mentioned above, the episode also features some fantastic photography (it still amazes me that the show looks this good nearly fifty years later!) and decent enough set-design
Overall 'The sixteen-millimeter shrine" is a great episode and above all is certainly one to make you think
Just saw the World Preem of Fido at the Toronto International Film Festival and thoroughly enjoyed it
Here we have a welcome reworking of a genre widely thought to have been pioneered (certainly 'fleshed out' extensively and successfully) by George Romero
But this is a Canadian film by a Canadian Director and it's a Comedy! And, YES, I actually think it is better than 'Shawn of the Dead'
Thoroughly believable and, perhaps even more importantly, enjoyable performances by Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and young actor K'Sun Ray, whom I suspect we'll be seeing a lot more of in future features
However, I must confess that I most enjoyed the delicious turn by Tim Blake Nelson as neighbour Mr
Theopolis, essentially playing a willing animated version of Victor Van Dort from the Corpse Bride (or, for those who've seen the film, wouldn't that read even better here as the Corpse Pride?) and, of course, Scotch actor Billy Connolly in his least animated, yet somehow deeply moving role as the titular character
Just think, he would not have gotten this role had it not been for Peter Stormare's commitments to Prison Break (as was revealed in the Q&A following Thursday night's screening)
I can't help but speculate that the Screenwriters must have drawn a lot of inspiration from Day Of The Dead's Zombie 'Bub'
I am not keen on ever revealing plot details during a Comment and I won't start now
Suffice it to say that Fido is NOT one of those dour, graphically gory Zombie films you can rely on from Romero
Rather it is a film that will have you constantly chuckling and, although (and I did have to think back carefully to be sure) there is a fair dose of blood-letting and violence, the delectable humour, so well enhanced by the surreal milieu created by Director Currie and his co-screenwriters, goes a long way towards making this seem like a feature that ought to be rated PG-13
I urge you to go see this little Canuck gem
I'll certainly be buying the DVD once it emerges hopefully by next Summer
I guess I'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film
Is it one of the best of the "Nightmare" series? Maybe not, but I had lots of fun with it
Freddy Krueger reaches his evil, wisecracking potential
Since parts 4 and 5 kind of lagged the series down, I felt this so-called final installment ("New Nightmare" is the real finale) brought the series out of its slump
There are some great nightmare sequences, including one where Breckin Meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed, falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game to which Freddy controls
This is both a highly original and hilarious sequence, especially when we see him out of the dreamscape, hopping around like Super Mario
And Freddy belts out the funny one-liner, "Great graphics
" And since the movie was made about 10 years ago, it brought back memories when Freddy started controlling the game with the Powerglove
Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers the Powerglove
I haven't seen Yaphet Kotto since "The Running Man," and I think the last time I saw that film was about 5 years ago
He's another great, underappreciated actor who possesses a powerful screen presence
And who can forget the cameos? The best one is by Johnny Depp (from the first "Nightmare") playing a spokesman for an anti-drug commercial
<br /><br />The 3D sequence at the end is really awesome! So for those who are looking to check this film out--please rent or buy it on DVD! Hopefully all the editions come with the 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video edition has the 3D element removed
<br /><br />I personally didn't see many things wrong with the film
The film is a great mix of humor and scares, and the gross-out effects are terrific
Could this have given better justice to the franchise? Of course it could have
And finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done
<br /><br />And in closing, I loved the montage over the opening credits
Fans of the series will be delighted, and will look at it as a tribute to beloved Freddy
Seriously, can you imagine such a spread of talent in one film without a huge budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor AND Fiona Shaw? There's no doubting that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved their awards: but it would have been entirely justifiable to have seen O'Conor (as Young Christie) and McAnally awarded: the cliché is true here: they don't perform the roles, they inhabit them
Day-Lewis' performance is a tour de force - such a transformation that it is awe-inducing, but it was truly a mark of the Academy's intelligence that alongside this performance, they also honoured Brenda Fricker's beautifully restrained, still and heart-wrenching work as Christie's mother
By the way, if you haven't seen this magnificent actress in "Swann", that's another film well worth checking out for her contribution (and the sublime Miranda Richardson)
Playing Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc
the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream
I love watching him interact w/ Amanda Blake, or Don Knotts or whomever--he clearly was having a ball and I think he made it easier on his guests as well--so long as they Knew ahead of time it wasn't a disciplined, 19 take kind of production
Relax and be loose was clearly the name of the game there
<br /><br />He reminds me of guys like Milton Berle, Benny Hill, maybe Jerry Lewis some too
Great timing, ancient gags that kept audiences in stitches for decades, sheer enjoyment about what he was doing
His sad little clown he played was good too--but in a touching manner
<br /><br />Personally I think he's great, having just bought a two DVD set of his shows from '61 or so, it brings his stuff back in a fond way for me
I can remember seeing him on TV at the end of his run when he was winding up the series in 1971 or so
<br /><br />Check this out if you are a fan or curious
Maybe I loved this movie so much in part because I've been feeling down in the dumps and it's such a lovely little fairytale
Whatever the reason, I thought it was pitch perfect
Great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially De Niro, who is awesome)
This movie made me happier than I've been for a while
<br /><br />It is a very funny and clever movie
The running joke of the kingdom's history of prince savagery and the aftermath, the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled
That's much of what makes it so good; it's an elaborate, special-effects-laden movie with more story than most fairytale movies, yet there is an incredible attention to small things
<br /><br />I feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again
This movie was made in 1948, but it still rings true today
It begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it "builds" from there
Anyone who has ever built a house, will find this movie very endearing
Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delightful in this film
This is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40's
Many references are made to the cost of things, and those comparisons to today's costs are pretty amazing
I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely
I am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it
The cast is different and now they took a different approach we have the street smart team "Networth" vs
the supposed professional team "Magna" but boy if you think the street smart team would have trouble you'd be right
While the Magna team has struggled at times, the street team has simply disintegrated week after week
<br /><br />First some things to reiterate as far as the "Apprentice 3" first of it continues the same absurd mentality (from Trump) and the game in this series: if your a good project manager, but you lose, the team will turn on you and you will be fired, despite the fact that your backstabbing teammates are often the ones who do half ass jobs
Simply absurd, that a game show that claims to hire the best candidate actually "weeds" out the best while the dysfunctional candidates stab each other until one is left and that person is the best
lol<br /><br />Anyone this season, weve seen a total of cursing, backstabbing and even gay offensive stereotypes carried out as teams try to do campaigns
<br /><br />The list of victims so far Cast Tara Dowdell , Audrey Evans , Danny Kastner those three are the only that I feel were unfairly fired by Trump, the rest really had it coming as they only incited conflict, anger and suffering
It's just amazing as one candidate Audrey Evans said as how she who did a good job was fired and how some of her worthless teammates are still in the game
<br /><br />Yes its the game, it's "The Apprentice" where manipulation, backstabbing, and always popular "everyone gang up on the project manager" mentality rules
<br /><br />It has been an entertaining ride, though, the candidates are given a wide array of assignments from photo shoots to the construction of mini golf courses, to building of new apartments
<br /><br />Still though it's still the "Apprentice" though so all you can do basically is laugh the whole time as the insanity and chaos insues until lucky person is the winner
Oh my gosh i live in Kentucky and when Mellisa Joan hart came to Louisville she went right through my neighborhood and waved at me i am filthy rich so she wanted to look at my neighborhood oh and i Love being rich any ways she came for the Derby back to my interest in the show
that show makes you want to point your finger at something and make it disappear i mean it is just so creative and i love it i would love to be on that show
that show is just amazing i mean who ever came up with that show i want to just give them a big kiss i mean it makes me feel better when I'm sick and makes me happy when I'm mad i mean if someone tells me they don't like it i will talk some sense in to you OK O
This is one of those movies that they did too much promoting for
, then you might as well not watch the movie
Almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews, except one which just happens to be Jennifer Annisten being the funny one
It is typical Jim Carrey humor and it is really funny
Just don't go see this movie expecting to be surprised
All in all, if you like Jim Carrey or comedies this is a must-see, otherwise just watch the previews and you'll be just as satisfied
Some films just simply should not be remade
But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title
Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds up, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke
But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects
Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film
But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more
I rented this movie simply because Rosario Dawson was in it
I sat down to watch it with my buddy and 6 minutes in we were glued to our seats
Not because of any intensity in those 6 minutes, but because it was a real film
No Hollywood BS, no explosions, no corny one liners; film
It drew you in slowly, reeling you toward a tragically human fate
Some people think they enjoy film but they are sadly mistaken
They like movies; mindless entertainment for entertainment's sake alone
Michael Bay's Transformers and the like were produced for just this audience
No need to think people, just watch and allow ever stereotype we can muster to slowly dissolve your brain
We'll even place advertisements throughout the movie, to keep you buying our products
And don't forget the explosions, we all love explosions
Here we make the distinction, art can be entertaining, but it's also thought provoking and moves you in hidden ways
Entertainment is rarely artful and even then only arbitrarily
<br /><br />If you still house a soul within your walking meat-sack apparatus, this rape scene is every bit as powerful as "Irreversable"
The distinction here is that "Irreversable" was a violent rape scene involving two people whose paths have unfortunately crossed at the wrong time and hell ensued
This is about trust violation, soul desecration and the scars that run deep
Had the character "Maya" been consenting it would have been a hot sex scene
But seeing as she was desperate to escape, the scene is sickening
"Jared" is a sick and manipulative serial rapist, and it's wholly unsettling because it so closely resembles a passionate love affair
How could "Maya" ever be close to anyone again when even in the midst of raping her "Jared's" slick lover boy facade only ever hints at slipping? She is ruined
<br /><br />The film as a whole is beautiful
The camera work and lighting at times removes the surroundings and focuses everything on "Maya" and the silent inner workings of her mind
All this accomplished by Rosario with facial expression and gesture
The soundtrack was excellent, a blend of everything
My particularly favorite scene being a synchronism of all these film aspects working together; "Maya" dancing in a sea of writhing bodies, something inside her awakening, becoming aware, all set to a beautifully sad Jeff Buckley tune
<br /><br />I don't think I've really spoiled anything here but I'm stopping before I do
Bottom line, I think this was the best film of 2007, hands down
Unfortunately it seems that everyone is so jaded these days that if you don't hack and slash, gang rape, or nuke anything then people just can't be bothered
Death isn't the worst thing that can happen to you
It's only the last thing that will happen in this existence
The worst things that happen never leave you
When you shower; when you brush your teeth; when you buy a Christmas present, when you tie your shoe; they haunt you
They haunt you until that last thing releases you
As a former 2 time Okinawan Karate world champion, I like movies about sacrifice for sport
I have recently been plagued by very serious injury and pretty much a disastrous lack of passion
And this silly little movie touched me so deep that like out of a daze it reminded me about what life is supposed to be about
Living your life for yourself and respect for others
God, bless "Bend it like Beckham" I believe it is a true gem
/* slight spoilers */<br /><br />Way back, before Evangelion was made, before Hideaki Anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans, and before Gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite, Gunbuster was made
With only Wings of Honneamise made by Gainax at that time, and the famous Otakon shorts or course, Gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up
It didn't make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before, space opera
<br /><br />Luckily, Gainax decided to put it out as a six-part OAV (direct to video) series
This allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film
This also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long, with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way
Besides that, they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in Macross or Gundam, and many other popular space operas
<br /><br />For one, the shows starts out pretty light, with Noriko in the Okinawa High School for mechapiloting
Noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle, when she was still a little kid
This makes her life at the academy quite hard, as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that Noriko is favored by the professors
The first episode is pretty much a comedy drama, with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school
Things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced, and Noriko and Kazumi (best girl in class) are chosen to help the assembled fleet out
<br /><br />The middle bulk of Gunbuster leaves our female lead in space, focusing on both personal drama and action
A couple more characters are introduced, and parts of Noriko's past are dragged up again
Besides that, the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute, and the Gunbuster, mankind's final hope, is presented
Smart as writer Okada was, he incorporated the principles of time dilation, to spice things up a bit
In short, time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light
This means that Noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete
Also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated, when Noriko sees her friends again on her return to base, who have aged considerably more than her
The science might not be perfect, but it's presented in a pretty believable way, with even some SD science theatre shorts in between the episodes, where Noriko, Kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series
<br /><br />The animation, for a series made in the 80s, is definitely good
The designs are retro 80s style of course, but it has it's charm
Animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice, although the costumes do betray<br /><br />some of the fanservice fascination Gainax will later exploit to the fullest
The mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too, with the Gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine, strong and vast
The last episode was entirely done in black and white
While it's generally believed (but not confirmed) that this was done for budget reasons, it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series, which is suited perfectly for the latter part
<br /><br />The music is very typical space opera fair
Too bombastic in places, very generic, and definitely not worth buying
It does fit the series for the most part, but it can become quite annoying at times
Tanaka is not really a famous composer, and the only other respectable series he's worked on is Dragon Half
If you think 80s anime music, you will know what to expect
<br /><br />As the series progresses, the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle, but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this
Step by step the drama will be toned down, and the battles will take the front row
Neither aspect is ever left completely out though
With the last episode in sight, Noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind, and with the last battle in sight, certain questions are presented to the audience, concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy, and how far it can go to guarantee self-preservation
While they are never answered later on, they still present some interesting food for thought
The last episode is very epic, with a nice, but quite predictable ending, though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course
<br /><br />Gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first, with alien invasions, huge battles, and some personal drama, and for the bigger part, it is
But it is done exceptionally well for a change
Instead of going for a steady mix of former elements, six episodes long, Gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism
Along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed-out characters, which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon
The show is very tightly written, although it does tend to slip up at some points
Overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided
Overall, the trip Gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic one
It might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre, but at least it bend them a little
Highly enjoyable anime classic, but not without flaws
This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt
If you leave away pretending you know or you care what Communism was about and how real Russians or Brits are, if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions, you can have fun with this film
Nicole Kidman is at her best, sexy, moving and funny
Ben Chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out-shadowed by Nicole, and the rest of the cast does good work as well
The final is moving, and logical - movie logics, of course
Worth watching, if you accept the rules of the game
You are emotionally involved with the characters
<br /><br />After watching this movie you will see why Reese Witherspoon's acting career has been so successful
<br /><br />The other cast members do a great job also
<br /><br />The movie flows extremely well
There is not a boring moment in the whole picture
The Man in the Moon's length is just right
<br /><br />As I said earlier, I think this movie was excellent
I have seen it numerous times, and have enjoyed every one of the viewings
Cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it's not the run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi flick
The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what's going on
The close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive
The sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie
The technology used in the movie isn't overly impressive, however, the director makes good use of the props
<br /><br />The character development is intentionally shallow
The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage
It's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it's the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end
If you've ever wondered why they don't make porn with a plot, watch Dream Quest
On the one hand, you have to give the Armstrong credit both for making the effort to capitalize on this idea and for using such a strong adult cast to put some name power behind it
On the other hand, it also quickly becomes apparent why most porns never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialog connecting sex scenes together
These people simply cannot act (and the story is, unfortunately, lame to a ridiculous degree)
<br /><br />Still, I gave it a 7 because it was a nice try and there didn't seem to be much of an effort to cut corners
Also, I'd like to see more attempts like this one
Maybe someday I will see the perfect combination of porn and plot
This is a very interesting reflections to the couples that will be come to the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family
This decision could be the better or the worst in our lives and the life of our kids
The real intrusion or help of 'friends' -or executioner if we leave-
The real role of families: they can help or they can destroy us
The mad priest who possibly is not much mad telling what could happen according the statistics and the reality
A couple who thinks in a 'special' marriage, live a painful story in their future own history
<br /><br />Who likes contract marriage? Nobody, after the priest tells their own history if they leave the future in another hands, if they don't know WHAT is the marriage
That the problems are true, that the life demand a real engage, guaranties, from each one
That the real victims of the divorce are kids, with real name Andrea in the film- or names
That the abortion is only an easy exit: sadness, regrets and unhappiness will be there after abortion
That the state and social security thinks every time less in a real problems of the families
The gossip of the 'friends', the infidelity because of weakness and desperation of Steffania because Tomasso lives his life as if he were alone
<br /><br />Maybe someone could think that this film is a pessimistic film, but not
Steffania and Tomasso, in the deep of their hearts, they like a beautiful marriage and family, if not, Why they like marriage? A truly and beautiful marriage depends only of the couple: of each one of their decisions, of each one actions in their lives
The family could be a place where each one feel loved because being his or her, only by existing
The performances are great: Steffania and Tomasso, ¡the almost cynical priest! An excellent direction and script
The colors and the management of the cameras, superb
Thre isn't a single Scorsese movie I'd place on a list of my favorite movies
But this is the best thing I've run through my DVD player in about five years
Scorsese's patient elucidation of favorite film moments, and how Hollywood works is incredibly gracious, calm and intelligent
<br /><br />It's 3 DVD-sides worth of material
It would have to be a British production, since everything about American corporate culture would have trampled the quiet, methodical, no frills, put-the-focus-on-the-content approach that is taken here
And an American production would have demanded he say he liked only movies that were popular favorites
I wish everyone took a page from his love of movies
You should love the movies you do for personal, idiosyncratic and specific reasons
Not just more "Me-too" votes for The Godfather, etc
People have no clue what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies
If they did, movies would be more interesting than they are
Scorsese DOES know what ideas are being explored, and that makes him a compelling, involved speaker on the topic
I really appreciate his articulate, generous interviews over the last decade
<br /><br />On a negative note, Scorsese is best when he's excited to show you some obscure movie, rather than when he's didactically teaching you something well-established about film history
And I do wish he pluck those three hairs out of the bridge of his nose
I am embarrassed to say that I missed "The Mother" when it was in theaters
I gave it a 10 vote, one of the very few I have given here
This English independent is filmed with such great care and quality
The story, low-keyed and purely human, is brutally honest and utterly absorbing, thanks to the acting of Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw
The storyline is epic, brilliantly clothed by writer Hanif Kureishi in mundane lives
This story addresses big issues with the subtlety of an impressionist painting
And some of those big issues are highly controversial, which probably explains the lack of awards won, despite many nominations
It is simply one of my all-time favorite films
I'M just a student that has seen this movie few minutes ago
AND I want to thank people that worked on creating this movie!It is not the best or the most
why???i would like to understand it myself
it is a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without any regret about the time wasted on watching it!It is about love and caring, about the life that we have but we miss it sometimes because of material stuff
Look at all the time that we have but we miss it
why a fu*k do we do that???We need to live like were dying
care about every second and remember:if we do good things-good things come back to us!HAppiness is real
i love this town and the world the we live in!!!!thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistakes(English is my second language)
This movie makes me want to fall in love all over again!I am naming my next daughter "Adelaide"
Just so that someone who sings like Ol Blue eyes can swoon her one day, and feel the butterflies I felt hearing it sung, and it wasn't even to me! I give it a 9/1
For some reason the greatest scientific mind of the 20th Century had never been the central figure in a movie*
The closest I can think of as films with Einstein in them are CHAMPAIGN FOR CAESAR, where (like a "deus ex ma-china") the great man is heard clarifying a point on a radio quiz show, so that Ronald Colman is proved to have given the correct answer after all, and in BULLSHOT where the great Albert is one of a dozen leading physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis by the villain, intent on stealing some machines of theirs
It is notable that in those two cases, and in IQ, we are dealing with comedies
So far nobody has tried to do a serious film about the life of Einstein, like John Huston's attempt to do one on FREUD with Montgomery Cliff
I guess it is just too hard to get the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of electro-magnetic field theory into exciting dialog
But then, only three years ago Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer did A BEAUTIFUL MIND
<br /><br />(*Subsequently, after writing this, I remembered the successful comedy YOUNG EINSTEIN with Yahoo Serious about ten years ago
But that is an exception and it was a spoof
)<br /><br />The other surprise was the actor playing the great Albert
It was Walter Matthau, here taking time away from the series of films he did with Jack Lemmon in that last decade of their careers
Matthau was a highly capable and gifted character actor, in both comedy and drama, but normally his comic personas were variants of his "Whiplash Willie" Gingrich from THE FORTUNE COOKIE
Later they would shed their criminal propensities because we had grown to like them, but they remained grumpy types
But his Albert Einstein happens to be genuinely sweet
More like his Kotch than like Willie Clarke
<br /><br />He plays Albert as good old uncle Albert
It seems that Matthau's Einstein is living in Princeton with his niece Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), and she is seeing a stuffy professor named James Morland (Stephen Fry)
But Fry's car needs repairs, and they take it to the auto shop where Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) works
Robbins falls for Ryan, who is attracted to him - but finds that he lacks the mental equipment that she admires
Good old uncle Albert, aided by his three friends (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, and Gene Saks) decide to give their assistance to Robbins and make him an apparently unrecognized physics genius
This will open the doors of romance between him and Ryan, provided Ryan is impressed and Fry does not spoil things (as he hopes to do)
<br /><br />The atmosphere is sweet, as when Matthau and his chums rig up a super physics quiz that they help Robbins cheat on (by switching the positions of their bodies)
The plot eventually leads to the outright lie that the brilliant Robbins has constructed an atomic powered rocket ship - which brings in the interests of the nation in the figure of President Eisenhower (Keene Curtis)
<br /><br />It was a charming comedy, and an interesting stretch for Matthau in that he was not as hyper as normal, but far more subdued
This is the story of Australian commandos who are captured out of uniform after a raid
Since they are out of uniform, they are, justly, treated as spies
As such, they are tried, convicted, and sentenced to death
The Japanese court-martial, out of admiration for their heroism, authorizes that they be given a warrior's death
Of course, under the code of Bushido, this means that they are to be beheaded
A fate for which, as westerners, they are unprepared
This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris, a high school science teacher/baseball coach, who is inspired by his players to try out for the pros and fulfill his life-long dream of playing in the majors
Dennis Quaid, no stranger to sports films, plays Morris with enough conviction to make the part work and the producers do a credible job of recreating the real-world events that led to Morris brief stint as a relief pitcher for the woefull Tampa Bay Devil Rays
The first half of the film, dealing with his rag tag bunch of High School Baseball players (all of whom look way too old to actualy be in High School) is less effective and probably a bit too long
Overall the film does suffer from some pacing issues and a few extra subplots that we probably could have done without
However, it is still a fairly involving movie with an inspirational theme that proves once again that baseball is the national pastime for a reason
Though it had the misfortune to hit the festival circuit here in Austin (SXSW Film) just as we were getting tired of things like Shakespeare in Love, and Elizabeth, this movie deserves an audience
An inside look at the staging of "The Scottish Play" as actors call "Macbeth" when producing it to avoid the curse, this is a crisp, efficient and stylish treatment of the treachery which befalls the troupe
With a wonderfully evocative score, and looking and sounding far better than its small budget would suggest, this is a quiet gem, not world-class, but totally satisfying
I have to say the worst part of the movie was the first half hour
For example, Bill Paxson's character had long hair and was wearing a jacket
Then, when all the males arrived at camp, it turned out there was a character who looked like Bill Paxson, but wasn't
I said where's Bill Paxson? Then, there was a guy with his girlfriend
This was supposed to be a 20-year reunion of the camp director's (Alan Arkin) most memorable
Later on, this same girl was interacting and talking about her camp experiences
That said, the movie turned out to be pretty good
Kevin Pollak was the nice guy who was always being teased
One guy was a complete narcissist, and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend
Alan Arkin was interesting as an old-style camp director, who admits that he has grown out of touch with modern youth
The best part was that none of the grown-up campers were successes in life
In some ways it wasn't as exciting as the Big Chill, but it was a lot more realistic
So, even though the beginning is not promising, the movie ended up turning into a pretty good one
I have to vote this 10 out of 10 in the rare chance that she happens to see this review, takes pity on me, whisks me to Hollywood and involves me in her freaky/funny world
First episode is obviously finding it's feet, but it's got that Silverman weirdness running all the way through it
It's not a laugh out loud sort of comedy, but that's good thing, too much has a laughter-track to it, and this wouldn't be right with cues when to laugh, it's to the audience to hear their inner jester laughing at the absurdness of it all
I can easily see this as being the bizarro Drew Carey show with it's weird characters and incredibly strong central character
Well worth a watch, look forward to the following episodes
A VERY good chance from the usual comedy out there
So the acting isn't award winning material and at times the action is slow-paced because the filmmakers are shooting longer sequences and not a million instants that then get edited into a movie
This film makes up for that with an outstanding script that takes vampirism seriously, explains it and develops a full plot out of it
Aside from the vampire story, we get detailed genetics info, legal and law enforcement, martial arts action, philosophical musings, and some good metal music
Kudos go to Dylan O'Leary, the director/writer/main actor
It is beyond me how this man could have fulfilled all these roles and do them so well
I think to appreciate this movie, you have to be well-versed in all sorts of themes to see that the writer did a lot of research and knows about all these things
There are some great camera work, too, interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack- something I haven't seen before, but which pays homage to the underwater zombie attack in Fulci's Zombi
The casting is good, in so far as the sexy female is sexy indeed
The main vampire also looks perfect for the role
My only complaint is that for a low budget horror flick, there should have been more nudity
If you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story, this flick is for you
I'm looking forward to seeing future projects by Mr
Home Room deals with a Columbine-like high-school shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors, their trauma, guilt and denial
<br /><br />*Spoilers* The shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion, with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage SWAT commando after shooting the high school killer
The film has three protagonists; the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident, played by a very young Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps
<br /><br />The two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensues
<br /><br />Erika Christensen, though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting
Busy Philipps, three years older than Christensen and altogether unknown to me, blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence
<br /><br />It's a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls
Gus van Sant's Elephant (2003) though good, seems almost superficial and paltry compared to Home Room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting
What I can see this film got very little screen time and exposure - so much more a loss for an equally traumatized America
Never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by Cagney and the other cast members namely: Dick Powell, (Scott Blair) who had a great tenor voice and Ruby Keeler, (Bea Thorn)
James Cagney plays the role as Chester Kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing Prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theater's during the 1930's
Chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows
This is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs
Joan Blondell, (Nan Prescott) gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty
Dick Powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career
For years we've been watching every horror film that comes out, from the dull Hollywood retreads like Saw 2, to awful indie releases that are completely unmatchable
we suffer through all of bad films in hopes of finding little gems like "Dark Remains"
<br /><br />We managed to catch a screening of this film at Shriekfest 2005
The audience loved it and I believe it ended up winning the award for the best film
<br /><br />While it may not have the budget or star power of studio films, it packs a serious punch in the creepy atmosphere and scare category
The acting and cinematography are top notch, but it's the direction that makes this film worth the view
The story and characters develop at just the right pace to provide some fantastic scares
<br /><br />The editing and visual fx are also top notch
And while many horror films don't manage to use music to their benefit, the score for "Dark Remains" only adds to it's creepiness
<br /><br />I know the film has shown at a bunch of festivals, but none have been near me, so I can't wait to hear when it'll finally be coming out on DVD
Trust me, even if you're sick of the current state of horror films, give this one a try
this is a great film!!!<br /><br />I first saw this film when it came out
I just recently saw this film again and it still holds up to my memory of it
A lot of films we watched when we were younger don't seem to hold up when we watch them later in life
The film is actually a great 80's example of the type of films made then
Keaton is at his best, all the actors actually did a very good job and Ron Howard was very good at letting the story push the movie along instead forcing it
The pace of the film is fast with few slow spots and seeing the cars from the 80's is too funny
Being from the 80's I loved seeing the ugly pacer again
The film is a great film for any comedy lovers and 80's film lovers
Here is proof of why Mary Pickford was `America's Sweetheart
' In this rather complex drama, Mary plays the young daughter of a squatter that dare to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the `hill-toppers
' The scenes where they steal a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply delightful
That Mary could pull this role off at the age of 30 is simply amazing and somewhat due to her diminutive stature (5')
<br /><br />Tess must face numerous physical and emotional challenges
She does so with spunk not seen in many heroines of the time
Tess packs a wallop and is not shy about fighting with anyone
Why she agrees to help the `hill-topper' daughter is beyond me, but she sacrifices her own happiness in order to keep a deep secret
<br /><br />Danish-born Jean Hersholt is simply wonderful as the villain
The scene in which he manhandles a small baby is enough to make you throw vegetables (or whatever) at the movie screen
If Forrest Robinson (who plays Daddy Skinner) had worn a beard, he would have been a match for the model used in those World War I recruiting posters of Uncle Sam  Wants You!<br /><br />Although the story is somewhat predictable and slow in the beginning, it is worth the investment in your time to see the piece or pure `Americana
' The film highlights choices available to us all involving making someone else happy and what it is to be a real Christian
Just as Tom Berenger put you into the soul of Sgt
Barnes, he has done it again with Thomas Beckett
If I thought his world was folding in on him in the first scenes, it was nothing compared to how much more I felt during the last scenes
I saw this movie yesterday on Turner, and I was unable to stop watching until it was over, even though I sort of could guess what would happen
Farrell was great in her role, and everyone else did a super job
Some of it seemed to stretch the limits, but all in all, I loved it!! If you get the chance to see it, please do! I actually cried at a few scenes, but then I guess if you are a mom you would
Loretta is beautiful, and I was just in astonishment at the very idea of their being unwed moms there, it seemed ahead of its' time
I say, WATCH IT if you can, and don't listen to criticisms
As they say, I laughed, I cried! I thoroughly enjoyed it
This is a cartoon series where most of the action takes place in the human body where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells etc
I will not try to explain it in more details, you will simply have to see it for yourself: You will not be disappointed
<br /><br />I remember watching this as a kid in the 80s (with Swedish voices)
I have talked with a few people who were also children in the 80s and they loved it also! I must admit that the education-part of the episodes didn't get through to me at a conscious level but the whole idea of educating children while they have fun is wonderful
I have recently seen a few episodes; there is a humour and heart in it that is hard to find in other children programs nowadays
PAGE 3 **** out of 4 Stars<br /><br />Madhvi (Konkona Sen) enters her boyfriend's house and its empty
She looks here and there and then goes in his bedroom and you get the picture - 'Ah! another girl  that two-timing baddie and yes indeed he his two timing her but it's a GUY this time around
And i say 'Brilliant!'<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS (The above scene is not a spoiler really
but for me it was so i didn't want to take a chance)<br /><br />When asked upon as how was this film, my friend answered 'oh, it just an exposé of the P3 people' which made me believe that ill be watching a stupid movie if nothing more
When I went to the theater, I thought to myself '' I better get a pen and a paper to jot down the bad things about this film'' but I was proved entirely wrong and then some because I could muster only the goods
Great, not because it is offbeat and noncommercial cinema like storyline but because of the cleverness in the screenplay and how this movie tells you how to handle a movie brilliantly which could have been a dumb and senseless movie if given in the wrong hands
She is so damn beautiful who has nailed her role perfectly as if she was born to play this part
One of the most charming actresses I've ever seen
But this is not the only performance which is good in the film, there's Sandhya Mridul, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni
Particularly Sandhya Mridul who just fires up the screen
(And guess what even the unusually accented Tara Sharma speaks normally)<br /><br />The movies stars off with some silly old parties of the hush-hush celebrities of the film industry et al and you get the idea of what this movie will be about
And for about half hour through the film you feel just about the same
But then the movie picks up the pace grabs onto a good storyline and never lets go of it
Even Boman Irani agrees to that statement  'It was a good story, Madhvi'
The great thing is that it tackles the issue of how silly these people are with style and does not make it over done and also tackles the social issues and does not make them boring
In the end its all a roller-coaster ride and Madhvi informs us that by just smiling at all these people
Just the reason why I love watching films
The screenplay is beautiful, clever and witty
This was the first movie that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable made together and they would go on to make several more
Crawford stars a young rich girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother
They have never worked before and the brother, William Bakewell, gets a job with Gable, who is a gangster and Bakewell thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick
Crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on
Their is a massacre in which several of Gable's men are killed and Crawford was a witness to the whole thing
It's a good movie but not one of their best
King's Solomon's Mines brings us Patrick Swayze (playing Allan Quatermain)who has spent a lot of time in Africa, but decides it is time to return to England and be a father to his son
He finds that his wife's parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with lots of money for a law suit
In comes Alison Deedy (playing Elizabeth) whose father is in Africa and being held by an African tribe for ransom of the map Elizabeth's father had sent her
Elizabeth seeks out Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father
<br /><br />There is a good cast of supporting characters that go along with Quatermain and Elizabeth and of course there are some enemies (Russians) who want the map also
<br /><br />The movie holds your attention until the end
Patrick once again plays a ruggedly handsome honorable man who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress
Patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, the rugged silent good man, anger and strength; In King Solomon's Minds his character actually smiles a few times
I would really like to see Patrick Swayze in a relaxed live-loving story again, one in which he doesn't have to clench his jaws and be quite so strong
But this is a good movie for the entire family and worth the time to watch it
If you're a T-Rex/Marc Bolan fan, I recommend you check this out
It shows a whimsical side of Marc Bolan as well as Ringo Starr, apparently having a pretty good time shooting some of the scenes that aren't part of the concert, but fun to watch, leaving you with a sense of getting to know them as just people, and when the concert is shown a talented musician, both playful and professional that rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls
Watching him in concert, you would never know that being a rock star is a job, but just having a great time playing some great songs with some good friends, like Elton John and Ringo Starr appearing in some of the live performances
True, there are a few songs missing that I would like to have seen on there, but like any album it can't have everything
I just bought this in 2006, but if I would have know it came out in 1972, I would have definitely bought it years ago
Sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars, would never learn to drive and would die in a car crash
The film transported everyone back to October 20, 1944 where we seemed to be part of the great Philippine 'I Shall Return' landing scene It was on that Leyte shore where General MacArthur reaped his fame <br /><br />Above all, Gregory Peck triumphed in his portrayal of the great general It is the stride, the set of the shoulders, the intensity It's what both men have had in common: intensity, total absorption, devotion With MacArthur it was for the military With Peck it was for the challenge of acting An Academy Award winner for "To Kill a Mockinbird", an Oscar nominee for "Keys to the Kingdom", "The Yearling", "Gentleman's Agreement", and "Twelve O'Clock High"he has played everything from an apparently homicidal amnesiac to a crusading journalist; from a troubled gunfighter to an obsessed attorney; from biblical David to Captain Horatio Hornblower He has brought to them all his own unique insight, his character, his sincerity, warmth and love, and especially, his humor <br /><br />There is a scene where 'MacArthur' stands on deck with the 'President of the Philippines
' We can hear the dialogue: "General, I hope the water isn't too deep," says the 'President,' "because my people will find out I can't swim
" Then come Peck's sonorous voice: "And my people are going to find that I can't walk on water!" <br /><br />As "MacArthur," Peck once again justified his reputation as a giant in the film industry Through him we felt MacArthur's emotions: we knew his anger, his happiness and we understood the relationship with his whole family
He glorified himself as a great supporting actor in `Glory', he proved he was no `Malcolm in the Middle' mediocre actor in `Malcolm X', he showed his brotherly love for acting in `Philadelphia', he pulled a slam dunk in `He Got Game', he pulled no punches and rocked us like a hurricane in `The Hurricane', he provided us effective thespian education in `Training Day', and now he has demonstrated that he could also direct! Denzel Washington's directorial debut `Antwone Fisher' is the most moving film of the year
This tearjerker `fish'er story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season
Unlike that Dolphin tragedy, `Antwone Fisher' possesses an emotional joyous conclusion
The movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child
Denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother
Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the best admirable acting I have seen by a novice actor in some time now
I actually saw some of the detailed eccentricities in Luke's acting as I have seen in Washington's past performances
It was like if Washington was telling Luke- ` la la la Luke I am your acting father'
Ok! I will lay off the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away
Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as the psychologist was masterful
But what can you expect from the acting `Master D' himself
`Antwone Fisher' was written by no other than Antwone Fisher himself
The emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife's screenplay was of `fisher king' material
Washington' in catching the right bait in `Antwone Fisher'
Simon is dead but somehow resurrects from outside
What he had seen there is displayed in form of blank spots orchestrated to a magnificent score by German avant-garde composer Werner Henze
Simon is haunted by his death, comforted by support of death people he'd seen on the other side
His girlfriend tries to hold him to life but failing to, decides to follow him after his finally occurring death
Very touchy and moving, deeply psychological, but a bit slow and somewhere even boring
The world of the 1973 sci-fi drama SOYLENT GREEN is what we could be seeing if we aren't careful
It is a world in which New York City's population has topped the 40 million mark in the year 2022
Overpopulation, air pollution, year-long heat waves, and food shortages are the rule
The only hope comes from a food product called Soylent Green
But what is this particular food stuff really made of? That question is at the heart of this admittedly somewhat dated but still intriguing film, based on Harry Harrison's 1966 novel "Make Room! Make Room!" Charlton Heston stars as Thorne, an NYPD detective who comes across the murder of a top corporate executive (Joseph Cotten)
As it turns out, Cotten was on the board of directors of the Soylent Corporation, the people responsible for all those food stuffs that the people have to consume in lieu of the real thing
Heston believes that this wasn't just a garden-variety murder, that Cotten was bumped off for a reason
He gets a lot of help from his slightly cantankerous but very astute "book" (Edward G
Robinson, in his 101st and final cinematic appearance), and a few timely reminders of what the world used to be like
What Robinson finds out about Soylent Green shocks him beyond all imagination; but before he can tell Heston all of what he knows, he has himself euthanized
And when Heston does indeed find out the secret of Soylent Green
well, that part has become immortalized into cinematic history
<br /><br />Under the very professional guiding hand of director Richard Fleischer (THE BOSTON STRANGLER; FANTASTIC VOYAGE), SOYLENT GREEN is a fairly grim but thought-provoking look at a Dystopian future that humanity might be living if we don't curb our tendency to strip our planet of its natural resources
Indeed, this was a project that Heston himself had had in mind for filming as far back as 1968, after he had struck gold in the sci-fi genre with PLANET OF THE APES--a fact that probably gets lost whenever his ultra-conservative political philosophy comes up in conversation (after all, SOYLENT GREEN is hardly a tract for unrestrained capitalism)
Robinson, as always, is the consummate professional in his last role; the sequence where he is euthanized (as he looks at video of the world from a better era, set to the music of Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, and Grieg) is quite simply heartbreaking
The film also benefits from solid supporting help from Chuck Connors (as a very convincing heavy), Brock Peters (as Heston's superior), and Leigh Taylor-Young as the woman who tries to help Heston in his inquiries
<br /><br />It must seem easy these days to dismiss SOYLENT GREEN for being dated
But those who do it ought to think twice; for this film's world may end up becoming ours in actuality if we don't watch what we do with what we have today
Sadly, 8 Simple Rules, for dating my teenage daughter, was the last sitcom that John Ritter got to work on after his tragic death in 2003
He was one of my all time favourite actors
He had it all, comedy (who can forget him in Three's Company) but he was also an excellent dramatic actor (Unforgivable  worth watching TV movie) As much I loved all the other cast members of the show (Katey, Amy, Kaley and Martin) John was THE star, he was much of the reason I was drawn to the show in the first place, and it was his perfect comedic delivery that was able to crack me up each and every time
<br /><br />I loved how the show wasn't all sugary sweet (as much as I loved The Cosby Show, come on, they were too nice to each other lol) they portrayed the typical family dynamics brilliantly
It was realistic enough what with all the sibling rivalry and the squabbles between parents, but they still kept it funny
A lot of American sitcoms try and fill the shows entirely with morals and what not, and this show didn't do that
Yes, there were some, like tackling important issues, such as drugs and bullying, but they didn't try and be anything other than a fun family comedy
<br /><br />The way they wrote John's death in to the show was brilliantly done, I still sob like a baby each time I see it
You could feel how raw the emotions were during those incredibly hard episodes
<br /><br />I'm sad the show was cancelled, I still enjoy watching the reruns, and I never get tired of it
<br /><br />John Ritter, you'll always be remembered for you hilarious depiction of this over protective father, who would rather lock his daughters up in their room than have them date a boy =) You rock Ritter!!
I recommend families if possible,to show this to older children only
Some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle
Now that thats out of the way,let me explain about this movie
This is in reality a documentary of a male fox,who in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate
The beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score,is breath taking
You had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible,it'll get ugly later
They gave both the fox and the vixen names,but I can't remember what they are for the likes of me
He fights off this invading male,to win her love
They later on create a den,and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubs;one of which is blind
There are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family,but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon
The first victim is the blind pup,who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away
The second victim is the mother,who while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole
While trying to escape she rips off part of her foot,causing her to bleed to death
The rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree
The male is now a single dad,forced to take on the roll of mom and dad
He alone has to teach them the skills they need for life
It later proves not to be enough,when two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own; thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man
I won't spoil the surprising ending for you,but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail
And it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through
I wanted to say that I saw this when it first came out in early 1980s, when we had a thing called Showbiz cable
I was only 4 when I saw it,but I could never understand why they wouldn't let me see all of it
Now I know why,after I secretly watched it when it came on Disney,when I was 9
I felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on
But as dark and ugly as it was,it serves a purpose
To let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals,and why they are endangered
This documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species,and I hoped it worked
Its not fake like the True life nature films by Disney,they don't teach about why animals are going extinct
The encroachment of land,the killing off of the foxes main prey,and senseless killing of these beautiful animals;has resulted in them becoming endangered
I wish they would make sequel to this movie,(Glacier Fox 2005)to see if they're being treated better
Maybe have it be about a vixen pup named Teresa and her siblings growing up
This movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes,especially when one of the parents suddenly dies
The surviving parent takes on the roll of both,and tries to teach the important lessons of life
It isn't always enough to protect them when they're adults,especially when some of their lives becomes ruined
Or they fall victims to tragedy themselves
Best all around soundtrack and musical score I've ever heard
There are a few spoilers in this comment!!<br /><br />Contrary to the comments I just read by nativetex4u and a few others, I really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series
<br /><br />I am a Judson Mills fan but also a huge Chuck Norris fan and while I'll admit that a few of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little, the storyline fit right in with other weekly series that are currently being aired
<br /><br />The opening fifteen minutes with Deke running from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very action packed
I do fail to see how that many "professionals" weren't able to hit a moving target, but the action was definitely there and Deke, being the hero, had to survive
<br /><br />As for the comment about needing to "get the movie in the can to fill the time slot after the playoffs
" This movie was not originally scheduled by CBS for a January airing and filming was completed in May of 2001, a good 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the U
<br /><br />If the writer of the comment had been paying attention to the movie instead of trying to avoid it, maybe they would have realized the plot of the story: Rashid, a Bin Laden like character, planned to set off a nuclear device in the United States
The President's Man was called in to locate and eliminate the problem
<br /><br />Perhaps the writer should actually WATCH the movie before attempting to comment on it
"Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the funniest martial art movies I had the opportunity to see
Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend
Just like Tang Lung of "Way of the Dragon
" Wherever Sammo goes, trouble starts, therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences
Luckily, Sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol, Bruce Lee
He even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly the way Bruce Lee does and also releases his screeching yell
There's a great showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters
Sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one
Sort of like "The Game of Death", where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another
<br /><br />This is one of the films I really enjoyed watching and also the very first Sammo Hung movies I've seen
Excellent fight scenes and a lot of laughs
A rare classic Sammo Hung film I highly recommend for all you martial art fans out there
I was so excited to see this film because I had always heard it was very scary
<br /><br />What's interesting about it is that it is a Japanese film they decided to bring to America, but they actually filmed it IN japan with the original crew! I think this made the film
more Japanese (which is probably why it managed to be fairly successful unlike most Japan-to-America horror movie flops) but it also made it a bit inaccessible to American audiences
The difference in what scares the Japanese culture and what scares the American culture felt present throughout the film
This worked well in moments when they meant to capture the nervous fear of the main character: a frightened fish in a big, busy, unfamiliar, Tokyo pond
<br /><br />The storyline was quite confusing as well
In typical Japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing
The beginning of the movie is actually the middle of the story and from there we move constantly forwards and backwards until, at the end of the film, we see the ending and beginning of the whole story
This constant flipping through time was very much confusing for me
Also, I didn't think some things were explained so well and I had to ask my friend to explain them to me (she had already seen it, as well as the sequel which apparently reveals more of the story)
<br /><br />Overall, there IS plenty for American audiences to love, tons of freaky imagery and macabre details which a healthy splash of jump scenes
In 1594 in Brazil, the Tupinambas Indians are friends of the Frenches and their enemies are the Tupiniquins, friends of the Portugueses
A Frenchman (Arduíno Colassanti) is captured by the Tupinambás, and in spite of his trial to convince them that he is French, they believe he is Portuguese
The Frenchman becomes their slave, and maritally lives with Seboipepe (Ana Maria Magalhães)
Later, he uses powder in the cannons that the Portuguese left behind to defeat the Tupiniquins in a battle
In order to celebrate the victory, the Indians decide to eat him
<br /><br />"Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês" is another great low budget movie of the great Brazilian director Nélson Pereira dos Santos
The screenplay is very original and the story is spoken in Tupi
The film is shot using natural light most of the time and is very realistic
The actors and actresses perform naked and Ana Maria Magalhães is magnificent, showing a wonderful body and giving a stunning performance
The sound is produced by the Brazilian musician Zé Rodrix
This movie shows the beginning of the exploitation of my country by Europeans, focusing in the Portuguese and French at that time, trading with the Indians and exchanging combs and mirrors by our natural resources
This movie was awarded in the national festivals, such as the 1971 Brazilian Cinema Festival of Brasília (Festival de Brazília do Cinema Brasileiro) with Best Screenplay (Nelson Pereira dos Santos), Best Dialog (Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Humberto Mauro) and Best Cenograph (Régis Monteiro); Art Critics Association of São Paulo (Associação Paulista dos Críticos de Arte), with best Revelation of the Year (Ana Maria Magalhães) and some other prizes
<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês" ("How Tasty Was My Frenchman"
Admittedly, I know nothing about baseball, I'm not even a fan of the sport, but that didn't stop me enjoying the Farrelly brothers' latest film, Fever Pitch, a charmingly irreverent romantic comedy
The film is not really about baseball; rather, it's really about relationships, and the emotional disconnectedness that can often take place
<br /><br />Jimmy Fallen  giving his best performance to date  stars as Ben, a dorky, lightly nerdy schoolteacher
Ben is a kind of man-boy, who unfortunately has never really grown up, and he fosters an almost fanatical addiction to the Red Sox baseball team
Ben has devoted his life to the Sox, and does everything from making the pilgrimage to Florida for spring training to decorating every square inch of his apartment in team paraphernalia
<br /><br />One day, while taking his honors geometry class to on a field trip to her office, Ben meets the go-getting Lindsey (a wonderful Drew Barrymore)
Lindsey is a corporate, career orientated kind of girl, but she has a kind of cuteness that Ben finds totally endearing
He's initially hesitant to ask her out, thinking that she's way out of his "class," and, Lindsey doesn't immediately see a potential partner in Ben
<br /><br />Their first date gets off to a disastrous start when Lindsey is stricken with a severe case of food poisoning  and her resonant retching provides the first clue that we are, in fact, watching a Farrelly brothers movie
Rather than accept Lindsey's - rather urgent - request to reschedule, Ben sticks around to play nurse, orderly, and janitor
So Ben scrubs the toilet and the dog's teeth, while his love interest is passed out with a bucket next to her bed
<br /><br />When Lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds him asleep on her couch, she begins the long, fitful process of dismantling the web of status anxiety and ambition she has come to think of as her standards
Soon they are falling in love, with Lindsey blithely accepting Ben's fanatical devotion to his sport
<br /><br />Having inherited choice season tickets from his beloved uncle, Ben has organized his life around the season  he's never missed a game
But their relationship, which has progressed without a hitch throughout the winter, hits a snag at the start of the season
<br /><br />Lindsey wants Ben to do other things, like holiday with her parents and party with her friends, but Ben begins to have trouble modulating his interest to meet Lindsey halfway
Can Lindsey consent to his irrational devotion to the boys of summer in order to make their relationship work? Can she really accommodate Ben's infatuation with sports? Can a die-hard and nerdy Red Sox fan find true love after all? Of course, Lindsey and Ben come with a colorful assortment of opinion-wielding friends
Lindsey's strictest buddy, the skinny, rich and blond Robin (KaDee Strickland), insists that there must be something wrong with the guy if he's still single at 30
However, plump, curly-haired Sarah (Marissa Jaret Winokur) and Molly (Ione Skye) supply a more optimistic and positive view of Ben
<br /><br />Ben's eccentricity could be applied to virtually any obsessive sports fan, while Lindsay's frustrations could be representative of any upwardly mobile career driven woman
Fallon is terrific as Ben, exhibiting real big screen potential, overcoming the not-insignificant challenge of keeping Ben from being unsympathetic
Barrymore, meanwhile, is equally charming as the workaholic Lindsey, particularly as she struggles to accept Ben for who he is without losing sight of her own needs
<br /><br />Fever Pitch really works, and even though there are lots of inspired comedic moments, the movie is also addressing the serious problem of sports addiction and how difficult it can be for couples to negotiate this fragile territory
<br /><br />Much of the movie was filmed at Boston's Fenway Park, which adds a fine sense of authenticity to the proceedings, as well as the ambiance of the games, though fully appreciating what transpired with the team will probably be limited to baseball aficionados
Even so, Fever Pitch is blessed with such a finely wrought and intelligently funny script that even novice baseball fans will find much with which to connect
While returning from a Christmas Eve shopping trip, an abused suburban housewife (Basinger) finds herself in a fight for survival after a disagreement with a group of delinquent youths takes a violent turn
<br /><br />Suffering the indignity of a straight to DVD release here in the U
, Susan Montford's directorial debut will perhaps not be given the recognition it deserves
This is a shame, as the standard of the writing, directing and acting is very good indeed, and certainly surpasses the quality of your average straight to DVD flick
<br /><br />Kim Basinger gives her best performance in some time as the downtrodden wife of an abusive husband (Craig Sheffer)
While Sheffer is not really given anything more to do than be a threatening presence, it is in their brief scenes together that Basinger connects - showing painful vulnerability yet hinting at the rage that will eventually boil over in her confrontations with the youths
It's a truly great, understated performance, her transformation from victim to aggressor is seamlessly played
<br /><br />Lukas Haas I initially thought was miscast, as he (along with the other three youths) just did not seem much of a threat
However, had all four youths been more physically imposing, the later scenes in which Basinger turns the tables against them would not have worked at all
The fact that these are four average men, albeit slightly unhinged, is the key to why the film works as well as it does
<br /><br />Apart from a few pacing issues during the latter half of the movie and a couple of cheesy lines here and there, what we have here is a great thriller that actually leaves the viewer with something to think about when the film is over
Some may be put off by the slow - burn nature of the opening scenes, or the abrupt ending
I say give it a chance, it's certainly more deserving of your time than Saw V
WAQT is a perfect example of a chicken soup not exactly for your soul
The broth unfortunately has lost its actual taste thanks to all the excess dilution and garnishing that went into its making
<br /><br />What's surprising and disappointing about WAQT is that it comes from a director who stayed away from the usual clichés of Hindi cinema in his first venture but who in his second outing gives in for all the stereotype film formulas
While Vipul Shah had the conviction to show something as implausible as blind men robbing a bank in AANKHEN, he just fails to induce life in the entire packaging of WAQT that is based on something as conceivable as a father-son relationship
Adopted from a Gujarati play Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu, WAQT does have a sensible storyline with a social message to back up
A mature look on the father-son relationship, a father's unconditional love towards his son and a son's responsibility towards his family
Ishwar Chand Sharawat (Amitabh Bachchan) who has established his entire empire on his own from the scratch leads an affluent life with his wife Sumitra (Shefali Shah)
Their only son Aditya (Akshay Kumar) never had the need to strive for anything since he got everything tailor-made and spoon-fed in life
Ishwar's pampering has only spoil him all the more
<br /><br />Aditya dreams to turning into a superstar but does nothing to make his dreams come true
In the meanwhile he marries his ladylove Mitali (Priyanka Chopra)
Ishwar hopes that marriage will make Aditya a more responsible man but he is disappointed
Aditya is still at his blithe best leading a carefree life
<br /><br />The endurance limit finally collapses when Ishwar expels Aditya from his house
The sudden change in the attitude of his affectionate father towards him and his now expecting wife baffles Aditya
He has no option left but to strive for the livelihood of his wife and his unborn kid
He starts turning into an independent man but the rift in the relationship between him and his father grows
<br /><br />The story is simplistic while the uncomplicated screenplay has a very elementary approach
One can easily identify and relate with the credible characters of both the father and the son
If you are not one of the two, you at least might have come across individuals like them somewhere in real life
<br /><br />Add to it director Vipul Shah's easy handling of the screenplay
With a family affair like this, any other director in his place would have added in tons of melodrama in the proceedings as per the cinematic laws of Bollywood family dramas, turning the film into a compulsive tearjerker
However Shah excels in the effortless handling of emotions for most part of the film
<br /><br />Clear-cut example of his unpretentious direction is palpable in the pre-interval scene where the father expels the son from his house in a rather frivolous manner
The purpose of the scene is achieved without blotting a brunt on the audiences' brains
Ditto for the scene in the second half wherein the now separated father son have a flippant conversation
That's what differentiates WAQT from a KABHI KUSHI GHUM or an EK RISHTAA and in fact places it one level high in terms of treatment
<br /><br />But after gaining all the distinction points, one may wonder where does WAQT still fail in? The problem lies in the fact that while WAQT distinguishes itself from the others in it's league in terms of treatment, it gives in to the glitches in the terms of packaging
What with the director forcing in song-n-dance every now and then in the first half
There's a Johar kinda shaadi song, a Chopra kinda Holi song, a father son disco dandia song, a dream song and a dream come true song inducing sufficient yawns in the viewer
the father has just ousted the son from his house and the son is dreaming of a song in Moroccan mountains with his wife
Out of place! Out of reason! and the audience Out of seat
<br /><br />The film just drags in the first half and the actual story starts only in the second half
The director has wasted too much WAQT on unnecessary elements
The much talked about dog chase sequence isn't bad but is not redeeming either
However Akshay Kumar's taandav dance is simply ridiculous
Imagine he qualifies for the star hunt in the movie with this (unintentionally) hilarious histrionic
Add to it the climax set at the finals of the star-hunt where the son bursts out with emotions
That's so archetypal! Also the editing pattern could have been reversed to conceal the father's reason for the change in attitude towards his son
<br /><br />Anu Malik's music is fine though unnecessary in the proceedings
Santosh Thundiiayil's camera-work is competent enough though not much demanding
Aatish Kapadia has come up with some good dialogs for dramatic moments
<br /><br />Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav make up or the light moments in the film very efficiently
While Rajpal Yadav has been going overboard with his comic histrionics in many films off lately, this time he underplays his character and is completely restrained
His deadpan expressions are perfectly complimented with Boman's over-the-top histrionics
<br /><br />Shefali Shah is convincing in the mother's role
Not to be taken as a censure but she is flawless in both playing and 'looking' her character
Priyanka is gorgeous and performs her part well
<br /><br />Of course the major applause deserves are Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan
Akshay is especially expressive in the scene where his doting father intentionally berates him to make him aware of his responsibilities
Though Bachchan goes a bit dramatic in a couple of scenes, his brilliance strikes throughout the film
<br /><br />To sum up, WAQT is like a soup whose ingredients are both tasty and nutritional but the final recipe somehow isn't as much appetizing
The movie starts out with a bunch of Dead Men Walking peeps sitting in individual cells, waiting for their inevitable meeting with death represented by the electrical chair
<br /><br /> Then our "hero", who is called Tenshu, is taken to the chair, he's zapped, and then
AHA ! He is given a choice by some creepy military guys who look really cool : Either we zap you until we've made sure you're actually dead OR you can walk through this door and take whatever destiny might lie ahead of you"
Our hero says yes to option 2, and then the actual story commences
<br /><br /> He wakes up in a different sort of cell (very high-tech and very big), where he finds another cell-mate, who also managed to survive the electric boogie-ride
A voice in the speakers tells them that they are free to do whatever they wish, as long as it happens within that room
Sounds a little suspicious, but the two men accept : What else can they do ?<br /><br /> What these two men do not know is that they have been set together, so they can awaken an inner urge to kill within them
Basically the unknown scientists in the background p**s them off until they decide that they should kill each other
Sounds weird ? Indeed, but there's a greater purpose to all of this
THIS is the part which should not be revealed, and so it shall remain unrevealed
<br /><br /> But fear not, it is the unknown that lures the viewer to watch more of this pseudo-action movie, fore it has an entirely different approach to the question : How long time can you stand being with a man who's an S
and would you kill him to obtain freedom ?<br /><br /> The first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest, it sneaks up without you actually knowing it
Then it becomes a roller coaster ride with WILD Matrix-like action fight-scenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic book from which the movie is based upon
<br /><br /> The movie is indeed very special, so special that normal cinemas won't view it under normal circumstances
However, the story is fascinating, the music is fantastic, and the actors do their bit (some more than others) to make the movie truly unique
<br /><br /> If you should be so fortunate that your cinema or video store has it, watch it, and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mainstream movies to earn huge bunches of cash
It was tender, and funny at the same time
The scenery was absolutely beautiful! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser gave award winning performances
I understand due to the story line her part had to be brief, but I did wish I could have seen more of her-she is a true pro
You will be able to recall experiences from your own life , hopefully in a positive way after seeing this movie
We were fortunate to see Paul Reiser at a Q and A after the viewing
He is a wonderful man, clever, eloquent and a "real Person"
It was truly an enjoyable night out!This is a must see movie
Listening to the soundtrack at the moment, the images come back with a vividness that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong (in order to be able to type this)
I've seen it twice thus far, and I should be ashamed for having seen it *only* twice
<br /><br />I've seen all Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli films, and they are invariably nothing less than masterpieces (except maybe for Nausicaa which was, even in the non-cut up version too premature compared to the nec-plus-ultra manga)
Still, their strength sometimes becomes their weakness, as they tend to get too naive/positive (Chihiro), or, with more nuance, a bit too explicit/moralist (Mononoke)
At least, compared to for example the other Ghibli master Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies / Only Yesterday / Raccoon Wars)
<br /><br />In Laputa, Miyazaki pours all the brilliant storytelling that tellers of tales have gathered and perfected over the ages, combined with a bit of morale, but nicely interwoven with not only a completely transcendental atmosphere, but also with the humor and amusement of for example Totoro
Every single main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties
The pacing is so perfect that I know of nothing except a black hole that would be able to exert such a gravitational pull on your whole being
The story sets out as an action flic with mysteries hinted at, but when the girl falls from the sky, unconscious, floating with the stone, and the main theme kicks in, you get a glimpse of the grand mystery you're about to uncover, but the story then settles and gradually, over a number of carefully selected scenes of action and serene beauty, builds to an unforgettable climax of melancholy, hope, beauty - like, following days of sombre gloom, finally seeing the horizon on a clear morning, knowing the path walked, seeing the distance ahead, but smiling at the mere fact of being able to catch a glimpse of it
<br /><br />It is so like an exploding white light in your skull that if by the time the credits start rolling you have kept your eyes dry and your mind numb, you should see a therapist
<br /><br />Despite the fact that technically-image-wise some more recent Miyazakis might be more overwhelming, this to me remains his undisputed masterpiece
If you take a fraction of a second to realise that this was made back in 1986, you can only come to the conclusion that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years
This of course has been suggested before, but to me this is his only film that can, on its own, fully illustrate that simple fact
If you miss this during your lifetime, you'll die with a huge gap - which would be a pity, as the coffin costs the same
I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old tomboy in rural Louisiana circa 1957
She feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen (a now rarely seen Emily Warfield), and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative Baptist upbringing
Then seventeen year old Court Foster (Jason London), the son of her mother's close friend (Gail Strickland) moves in next door, Dani experiences her first crush, while Court enjoys her company, and willful spirit
Dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls head over heels for her, leaving Dani behind
The sisters' close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts, which only deepens when Court dies in a tragic accident
The girls then are made to realize how much they need each other
<br /><br />Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as the loving parents, trying to balance their daughters' individuality, at the same time trying to keep the family together
The beautiful cinematography, and the wonderful soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley, The Platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film's atmosphere of a simpler time
<br /><br />A touching coming-of-age film with a timeless message
Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting
Fontaine is great, but some others, particularly Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are exceedingly wooden
Ney lies in bed, dying of arsenical poisoning, with every hair in place
Yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful
More faithful to the book than most movies of its era
Casting Joan Fontaine as a poisoner (and an adulteress, which was just as shocking then - I'm not kidding, kids) was a masterful stroke
As murderers were supposed to, she dies by falling "feet foremost through the floor into an empty space
This is a film about 17th Century Italian artists and one artist in particular, a woman Artemisia, an unheard of profession for females at that time, and she dared to paint the male nude detailing his unique musculature
<br /><br />The camera work is principally indoors for that is where the artists mainly worked
Close-ups by candle light suggest the beautiful work of the classical painters and it is fascinating to watch the painters and their students supported by elaborate scaffolding brushing in details of religious frescoes
It is not surprising that the artistic elements of the film (costumes,faces, make-up) are quite superbly authentic because the Italian churches have preserved all these details in their frescoes for centuries
The beautiful Artemisia is urged by her father to study under the great Florentine artist, Tassi, who has become expert in the art of perspective and landscape painting (something very new) but the unsuspecting Artemisia is introduced to more than new techniques in painting
After posing for her, Tassi violently rapes her
<br /><br />This romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an unsatisfactory ending
The outstanding feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail
Scenes such as women running across a field with the wind billowing their voluminous clothing add wonderful effects
<br /><br />Artemisia says she paints to please herself; her father paints to please others
As for this film, it will please most, I think
These type of movies about young teenagers struggling with their own sexuality were something unique and daring and daring a couple of years ago but more and more movies like this got made over the past few years, making it hard for the movies to still stand out really
<br /><br />Also this movie received little publicity, aside from the usual little film festivals that featured this little French movie, as well as the big festivals that are always fond of these type of little movies about everyday subjects that aren't being handled too often in movies
The film premiered at Cannes in 2007 and actually won some awards there as well
<br /><br />The movie doesn't really stand out from others, since it actually features little new once you've already seen some similar movies such as this one but this however really doesn't mean that "Naissance des pieuvres" is a bad one to watch
The movie is certainly a good watch, that handles its subject well and tells its story steadily and therefore also effectively, in a typical somewhat slow French cinematic pace
<br /><br />It's a coming of age movie, that focus on the life of mainly 3 totally different mid-teenagers
Sexuality is a big theme within the movie, which gets handled delicately and subtle
It makes the movie and its story overall a pretty realistic one, though perhaps a bit predictable, since the movie doesn't quite offer anything original enough within its genre
<br /><br />This type of French movie will probably scare off a lot of people because of the reason that they probably expect it to be very arty, with deep layers and meanings to it
"Naissance des pieuvres" however is a very accessible movie for everyone and you really don't have to be into Euro-teen movies to appreciate this movie
It's a sweet and somewhat sensual kind of movie, due to its subject and visual approach
<br /><br />The movie is also being made realistic by its actors, who don't had and have a lot of experience within the movie business but are authentic looking and feeling within their roles
The strong individual characters provide the movie with some nice themes and good moments
I like this episode quite a bit, Ruth Gordon is good if not a little hammy as she always was
As has been stated, the music is very good, and it has a moodiness that doesn't exist in all episodes
<br /><br />But one major plot hole exists, so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it
It is established that the light doesn't work in the vault
Don't you think that the very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked? You'd think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note
Granted this is TV whodunit fiction, and various holes will always be found, but this seems much too glaring
<br /><br />It really doesn't make Columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesn't work but the "death bed" testimony goes on unfound, apparently for days
The comments made before is from someone who obviously doesn't get it
The movie is campy- yes! But it is uplifting and fun
This movie is an underground hit and brings comparisons to Absolutely Fabulous
Released two years before I was born, this Oscar-winning movie has it all - lavish Technicolor sets and costumes, breathtaking cinematography, superb wall-to-wall Gershwin music, superior choreography, a lighter-than-air screenplay, and great performances by Kelly, Levant, Foch, Guetary, and Caron
Hollywood doesn't make 'em like this anymore
Definitely, this is my favorite movie of all time, a standard by which I judge all other films
the time taken to develop the characters, the attention to detail, the superb performances, the stunning lighting and cinematography, the wonderful soundtrack
<br /><br />It has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that won't work for anyone who wants the typical fast-paced action flick
If we lived in Elizabethan days, I'd say this movie's a bit like a Shakespearean tragedy
But since we don't, let's say it's more like a Drama-Suspense movie
<br /><br />The plot is simple, but the story is complex
The movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored
Much of the story is shown rather than told, which I find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book (or graphic novel)
At times I felt I was actually there in the 1930s, part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling
<br /><br />I don't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon, but in this case I do
) I've bought the DVD, which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary
<br /><br />(I also took my little cousin, who's a little younger than the boy in the movie, to see it after I saw it for the first time, because he has issues at home and I wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father-son issues with him
The key to the joy and beauty, the pain and sadness of life is our ability to accept that life basically is what it is so we don't constantly struggle against that single compelling truth
Elegant in its simplicity but so hard for most of us to grasp
<br /><br />In this film, the director shows us this truth but allows us to discover it in our own way
This is a beautiful yet simple story, more of a fable, which is played very well
Watching the actors is more like being in a room with real people than it is just watching actors
<br /><br />I struggled with how to write a review of this fine film so others would be motivated to see it
Sounds like a real turn off, right? But, nothing could be farther from the truth
The American title for this film is The Shower but that is almost an antithesis to a major thematic element in this film, which is the bath
Talking about the story or the characters will not do them justice
<br /><br />So, I'll just tell you how much I enjoyed watching this movie and how touching and moving the experience was
I cared deeply for the characters and I cared deeply about what happened to them
For any story, that is the highest form of praise
<br /><br />If you were moved by movies like The King Of Masks or Not One Less, then make sure you see The Shower
Netflix has it and the DVD video and sound quality are excellent
I watched it in the original lanquage with well done and well placed English subs
Without Kirsten Miller this project needn't have been completed
However with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is Miss Miller I would definitely recommend it
It looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance
Wagner's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but his few scenes didn't detract from being entertained
Mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line, the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster
The charismatic Miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable
She plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be
I wish I had seen this on the big screen but alas I was fortunate to rent it before it was lost
If you have sons or daughters who love action, adventure, intrigue, and imagination - without the need to break into song every twelve minutes - then this is the Disney movie for you! My sons loved every minute of this film, and I have to admit that I laughed out loud many times throughout the movie
There are no sappy songs to get in the way of a wonderfully told story, and the characters are all lovable and identifiable in their own right
This should go down as one of the Disney "classics" because of its beautifully illustrated scenery and its non-stop excitement
There's a certain allure I've always found in discovering the great (semi-) unknown film
These discoveries have nearly always been dramatic films - in my experience, unknown sci-fi, action and horror are unknown for very, very good reasons
I found "High Tide" on video at a junk store, mixed in amongst countless dozens of tapes of varying quality
Of course, that's the only place I would find it, as it is still not on DVD
<br /><br />While I was watching Judy Davis (as Lillie) throughout the course of this film, I was somehow certain I was watching a great undiscovered performance
Yes, I had previously seen Davis in several small parts - and one starring role in "A Passage to India"
But, although she was superb in the aforementioned film, "High Tide" is a different animal entirely
Since recently watching Gillian Armstrong's later film, "Charlotte Gray", I was acutely aware of the sort of actress which impresses her
Davis draws much more than a passing resemblance to Cate Blanchett - in both manner and sensibility
<br /><br />Judy Davis' performance is stunning, I cannot say enough good things about it
She shares an amazing on-screen relationship with young Claudia Karvan (as Ally), this film's other great actress
There's a lot of drama and quiet humanity they share together, the details of which I won't presume to reveal here (see it for yourself!)
There's too much good in "High Tide" to cover in one review
Indeed, I would hardly care to - the film speaks well enough for itself
In conclusion, I would like to praise screenwriter Laura Jones for her stunning dialogue, director Gillian Armstrong for her understanding of actors, and the great Russell Boyd for his brilliant, understated cinematography (please see his work in "Tender Mercies")
I am watching the series back to back as fast as possible
I am attempting to watch all things Star Trek
This is month 3 and I am now on Season 3 of TNG and I have already gone thru DS9 in its entirety
Star Trek is the greatest television phenomenon ever achieved
<br /><br />"Shades of Grey" is the first recap episode in the TNG series
Having just watched the shows, these clips were fresh in my mind, but I noticed how a couple of them were re-shot because the film looked better
Season 1 always seemed real dark and ugly to me - and the actors looked silly, like they didn't fit in their own skins
<br /><br />The show is essentially just made of up a greatest hits of the happiest and saddest moments in Riker's life on the Enterprise up until this point
The Data and Riker scene in the holo-deck is a classic moment of new friendship
My other favorite is when the 2nd officer on the Klingon ship challenges Riker's authority as first officer and Riker beat the living CRAP out of that Klingon
This entire episode is a heck of a reminder that a LOT of crazy, great things have happened already in a mere 2 seasons with 5 more to go and a handful of movies! At this point in the series they are really starting to develop the emotions that tie Riker to Deanna Troi as Imzadi
Up until this point they have mentioned the fact, but they have yet to exploit it
Let the record show that the ST Wiki - Memory Alpha claims that Imzadi means "first" and denotes that she has had intimate relations with Riker and also remains deeply close on an emotional one
This episode further proves there will be a tense romantic interest in each other for a long time to come
<br /><br />Here is the article: http://memory-alpha
org/en/wiki/Imzadi By this point in the series, production value is up to speed and Star Trek TNG is settling into the sci-fi behemoth it was destined to become
Watching this again as an adult I see now what GREAT ACTORS the Star Trek Universe provides
They really need to make a new ST show set after all the current shows
A classic sci-fi film with humor, action and everything
This movie offers a greater number of aliens
We see the Rebel Alliance leaders and much of the Imperial forces
The Emperor is somewhat an original character
I liked the Ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the Vietnamese
(Excellent references) I loved the duel between Vader and Luke which is the best of the saga
In Return of the Jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the Empire finally falls
I also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills Vader's redemption and returns hi into Anakin Skywalker spirit along with Yoda and Obi-Wan
The greatest scenes in Star Wars are among this movie: When Vader turns on the Emperor
Luke watches and finds comfort in seeing Obi-Wan, Yoda and
his father (1997 version not Hayden Christenssen)
The next best scene is when Luke rushes to strike back Darth Vader to protect Leia
There is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending
I felt there was much more than meets the eye
And as always the John William's music will bring the classicism into Star Wars universe
After the failure of "The Crusades" at the box office, Cecil B
DeMille stopped doing films about non-American history
His films for the next thirteen years were about our history from Jean Lafitte to World War II (Dr
The first in order of production was this film, starring Gary Cooper as Wild Bill Hickok, with Jean Arthur as Calamity Jane
James Ellison was Buffalo Bill, John Miljan (not a villain as usual) was General George A
Custer, and Anthony Quinn was one of the Indians who fought at Little Big Horn
The villains were led by Charles Bickford (selling arms to the Indians) and Porter Hall as Jack McCall (who killed Wild Bill Hickok)
<br /><br />Basically the film takes up the history of the U
Lincoln is shown at the start talking about what is the next step now that Lee has surrendered
Lincoln talks about the need to secure the west (more about this point later)
Then he announces he has to go to the theater
That April 14th must have been very busy for Abe - in "Virginia City" he grants a pardon to Errol Flynn at the request of Miriam Hopkins on the same date
<br /><br />Actually, while Lincoln was concerned about the West, his immediate thoughts on the last day of his Presidency were about reunifying the former Confederate states and it's citizens into the Union as soon as possible
It was Reconstruction that occupied his attention, not the west (except for the problems of Maximillian and his French controlled forces in Mexico against Juarez)
But he had been involved in actual problems with the West
In 1862 he sent disgraced General John Pope, the loser at Second Manassas, to Minnesota to put down a serious Indian war by the Sioux (the subject of McKinley Kantor's novel, "Sprit Lake"
Pope, incompetent against Lee and Jackson, turned out to be quite effective here, and the revolt was smashed
<br /><br />However, with all Lincoln's actual attention to western problems, it is doubtful that he says (as Cooper repeats at least once), "The frontier should be secure
" There is nothing to say he could not have said it, but it is hardly a profound pronouncement by a leading statesman
Like saying, Teddy Roosevelt said, "Eat a good breakfast every morning for your health
" It is not a profound statement of policy
It is, at best, a statement of recognizable fact
Cooper turning it into a minor mantra, like Lincoln's version of the Monroe Doctrine, is ridiculous
typical of the way DeMille's scripts have really bad errors of common sense in them
<br /><br />However, this is not a ruinous mistake
"The Plainsman" is an adventure film, and as such it has the full benefit of DeMille the film creator of spectacle
But not as a textbook on Lincoln's political ideas or his quotable legacy
I truly enjoyed the movie, however, I did not realize that Little Richard had so many things going on in his life
There is very little (hardly any) mention of females being intimately involved with Little Richard
Even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of females in a romantic way
I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned
I also did not like Leon playing the part of Little Richard, he is a good actor but I feel that the part of should have went to a different actor
Visually he did not remind me of Little Richard
I also was totally unaware of the promiscuity that Little Richard was a part of
From the movie he was pictured as a sexual addict
In todays time he would be referred to counseling for his sexual addition
I don't want to ruin the movie for someone that has not seen the movie however there were several things about the movie that I feel should not have been a part of the final cut
This movie about 4 prisoners, trying to escape with the help of spells, written by another prisoner centuries ago was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and lots of suspense
Even if it had something of a theater-play (almost everything happens in the cell) it never got boring and it was acted very well
In the tradition of "Cube" you felt trapped with the Characters and even if they were criminal, you developed some sympathy with some of them, only to change your mind by the twists the story takes
Some happenings catched you off guard and there was always a touch of insanity in the air
Altogether intense and entertaining and as I didn't expect anything (a friend rented it), it was a positive surprise
Stoic and laconic soldier Sergeant Todd (a fine and credible performance by the ever reliable Kurt Russell) gets dumped on a desolate remote planet after he's deemed obsolete by ruthless and arrogant Colonel Mekum (deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Jason Isaacs), who has Todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of genetically engineered combatants
Todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self-reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise
Anderson, working from a smart and provocative script by David Webb Peoples, depicts a chilling vision of a bleak, cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough, gritty tone throughout
Moreover, Anderson handles moving moments of humanity well (Todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant) and stages the stirring action scenes with rip-roaring gusto
Russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of Todd; he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions
Bang-up supporting turns by Jason Scott Lee as brutish rival soldier Caine 607, Connie Nielson as the compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as the kindly Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as mute little boy Nathan, Gary Busey as crusty seasoned veteran Captain Church, Michael Chiklis as the jolly Johnny Pig, and Brenda Wehle as the sensible Mayor Hawkins
Better still, this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might
David Tattersall's polished cinematography, Joel McNeely's rousing full-bore orchestral score, and the first-rate rate special effects all further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction/action hybrid outing
Riveting drama, scripted by William Mastrosimone based on his stage play, in which Farrah Fawcett plays Marjorie, attacked in her car by rapist Joe (James Russo)
She manages to get away but the cops inform her that there is nothing they can do
She realizes, however, that Joe did get her wallet and knows where she lives
When her housemates Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) are off at work, Joe pays her a visit to finish what he started
After Joe humiliates and degrades her in a variety of ways, she gets a chance to strike back at him and imprisons him
Knowing full well she's in another "his word against yours" situation and that no rape technically took place, she has no intention of taking it easy on him until he confesses to Pat and Terry what his intentions were
<br /><br />The movie ultimately amounts to a showdown between its two opponents
As it goes on, Marjorie displays such ruthlessness that one has to wonder if she hasn't become as unhinged as her nemesis
Fawcett does a creditable enough job, while Russo is truly excellent as the depraved creep who does his best to manipulate the situation
With only two characters on screen for much of the running time, the film has an intimate nature that does suggest that it would work even better on stage
Young doesn't shy away from the uglier and more exploitative elements of the situation; the film does become uncomfortable to watch at times
And by the time Marjorie has the upper hand, things change enough so that it no longer becomes quite so easy to encourage her to go for blood, and one hopes that Pat can make her see reason
<br /><br />"Extremities", I felt, was a pretty good movie that at least maintained interest and a fairly high level of intensity
Woodard and Scarwid are both fine in support (Scarwid has a great moment where Terry reveals herself to be a rape victim), and the pace is consistent
Granted, the dialog isn't always very sharp, but the material is compelling every step of the way
To me, the final scene, in which Harris responds to the press corp, is worthy of viewing this intelligent and timeless slice of politics(especially the campaign phase)
If only the "real-life" pols would respond in the intelligent, articulate manner as did Mr Harris,then the arrogant, self-serving members of the press would perhaps think twice before surfacing irrelevant, confrontational "garbage" that has absolutely nothing to do with a candidates abilities to effectively handle the challenges of the office for which he/she is pursuing
I really liked this Summerslam due to the look of the arena, the curtains and just the look overall was interesting to me for some reason
Anyways, this could have been one of the best Summerslam's ever if the WWF didn't have Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna, now for it's time it was ok to have a huge fat man vs a strong man but I'm glad times have changed
It was a terrible main event just like every match Luger is in is terrible
Other matches on the card were Razor Ramon vs Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michaels vs Curt Hening, this was the event where Shawn named his big monster of a body guard Diesel, IRS vs 1-2-3 Kid, Bret Hart first takes on Doink then takes on Jerry Lawler and stuff with the Harts and Lawler was always very interesting, then Ludvig Borga destroyed Marty Jannetty, Undertaker took on Giant Gonzalez in another terrible match, The Smoking Gunns and Tatanka took on Bam Bam Bigelow and the Headshrinkers, and Yokozuna defended the world title against Lex Luger this match was boring and it has a terrible ending
Kimi wa petto is a cute story about a girl who one day finds a boy inside a box that is outside her apartment one day
She decides to bring him in and fix his cuts
She then leaves a note for him to eats some food she made then go home because she had to go to work
When she gets home however she finds that he is still there
He tells her that he wants to live there with her like a brother or cousin
In desperation to get him to leave she tells him that if he became her pet then he could stay
And as a pet she says that he would have no rights and do whatever she told him
(not in that perverted way!) To her surprise he agrees and from then on he is known as Momo, her pet
I don't know who could find fault with a simply human and funny film like this with lots of delights for your heart
I enjoyed each minute of it and guessed the ending half way through the movie -- but that did not disappoint me at all
It will not only touch your heart but it's such a good family friendly film--we need many more like these
A bit slow (somehow like a Sofia Coppola movie) but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls
The magic of the movie lies in its capacity to bring back many memories to how it felt like to be their age
The confusion and the insecurities are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life
The music is perfect and the acting is amazing
I highly recommend it for those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires
I would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through that period
So many movies have been made about adolescence but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexities
I had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season's entries
While there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries, at least this episode turned out well
Its rather funny that director Rob Schmidt who only has the not bad Wrong Turn to his credit and writer John Esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season
In "Right To Die" we are treated to the story of Cliff and Abbey
At the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation
Abbey has caught Cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back
While they speak, they find themselves in a car accident where Cliff is left with only scratches and bruises, but Abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire
Once in the hospital Cliff must decide whether or not Abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes
Every time she flatlines, Abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people
Hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever
From the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists I never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it, Right To Die should have the right to go on living forever
The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is a compelling documentary on the migration of the Bakhtiari tribe of Persia
Twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to get to pasture
You'll feel like a pampered weakling after watching these people herd their animals through ice cold water and walk barefoot through the snow to cross the mountains while trying to get their animals to walk along steep and narrow mountain paths
I would just like all of the fans of this documentary to know that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I am so darn proud of him
This mini-series that in shown on VH1 is a great look at the culture of drugs in the past 30 years and my uncle worked very hard on it
The amount of time and effort that I have watched him put into this documentary and the book that started it all (Can't Find My Way Home) makes it that much better to watch him on TV
I know that he loves what he does and he does it well
His eloquence is shown in the interviews, which he did himself, and the amazing additions that he himself adds to the commentary
From the music to the videos and everything in between, this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of the drug culture through the eyes of someone who lived through it
I appreciate any comments on this from those who enjoyed it (or didn't) and would love to hear from fans! Three cheers for uncle Martin!!
This is one of the best crime-drama movies during the late 1990s
It was filled with a great cast, a powerful storyline, and many of the players involved gave great performances
Pacino was great; he should have been nominated for something
John Cusack was good too, as long as the viewer doesn't mind his Louuu-siana accent
He may come off as annoying if you can't stand this dialect
The way that Pacino's character interacted with Cusack's character was believable, dramatic, and slightly comical at times
David Paymer was great in a supporting role
There were times when this picture mentioned so many characters, probably too many
It may take a second viewing to remember, "which Zapatti was which?" After so many cross-references, one has to stop and think just to recap
It was built up for so long and then was a bit of a letdown
This was one of the few problems with the film
Since the movie wasn't billed as a "huge, blockbuster" big screen hit, it made some forget that this movie even existed
Pacino and Aiello were great but the film's lack of "splash" in the theaters may have accounted for no nominations
It was semi-successful in the home market, and viewers are still learning that this title is out there
Made in 1996, it still stands up today and will remain popular for many years to come
<br /><br />So, make yourself some lemon pudding (you'll see) and see this movie
After three and half years of hibernation,Rajini has acted in this movie
<br /><br />This is not a typical Rajini film, in this film he gives some spiritual messages also
But it also includes typical Rajini actions,style,songs etc
Its a good entertaining movie and gives good messages also
<br /><br />I will rate this movie as Good instead of Excellent because of the screenplay
I've been twice in Japan last year and the movie gave me this typical Japanese feeling
The movement of the camera is superb, as well as the actors
It goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic
Japanese people are very sensitive and kind and it's all very well brought onto the screen here
The director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details
Once you've seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director
It's a real feel good movie and I can only recommend it to everybody
- Having grown tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions of New York City, Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) finds a property in the country for his wife and children
But, building a house proves to be anything but simple
As the headaches and the bills start piling up, so do the laughs
Blanding's ever get his dream house? <br /><br />- What makes this movie so special is the three main actors - Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas
Any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own, so when you combine their talents, almost every scene is special
Grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role
He is so good at playing the put upon husband
The Thin Man films she made with William Powell are near perfect
And Douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years
Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House, a particular favorite of mine
<br /><br />- The movie is definitely a product of its time
I get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a two-story, three bedroom, four bathroom house on $15,000 income a year
Throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a live-in maid and it becomes almost fanciful
<br /><br />- However, for anyone who has bought or built a house, many of the situations and predicaments the Blanding's find themselves in are easily relatable to today
How many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr
Blandings is the whole "wife in love with best friend" subplot
It's really not necessary to the plot and feels out-of-place and very uncomfortable as presented
"Painting is seeing, then remembering better than you saw
" So says Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), the painter in The Light That Failed
The movie is in the grand old Hollywood style, starring Ronald Colman and a bravura supporting cast that includes Ida Lupino in her first important role, dependable character actor Dudley Digges (who also co-starred with Colman in Condemned
),and a solid performance by the wonderful actor Walter Huston
<br /><br />The title and opening sequences of the film pretty much give away the fact that Dick will lose his sight
He's blinded by gun powder discharge as he and childhood sweetheart Maisie (Muriel Angelus) are playing with a pistol
Later a wound while fighting in the Sudan is the catalyst for his blindness
He becomes a famous painter, but he's already blinded by ambition, and doesn't really reach his full potential until the point that his sight is leaving him
Enter bad girl Bessie (Ida Lupino), and his self destruction is set in motion
Lupino is very powerful in this role and plays off Colman very well
Her evil tart reminds me of Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage
<br /><br />Well acted and well directed, this is one of my favorite Colman melodramas
An excellent movie and great example of how scary a movie can be without really showing the viewer anything
It's a set of four stories all revolving around the tenants of a charmingly old-fashioned house and their various gruesome and horrific fates, all tied together by a wrap-around story about a Scotland Yard inspector searching for a missing horror film star
It starts out with a story about a mystery writer whose main character becomes a little too realistic, followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed over a wax figure in a museum, then a story about a sweetly angelic little child who is anything but, and closing with the story of what happened to the missing film starand what he does to the inspector
It's a gorgeous print that lets you really appreciate the work of director Duffell and what he was able to accomplish with a very small budget
Add to that the acting talents of Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee and you've got a movie that can be enjoyed again and again
Just don't answer the phone if anyone from Stoker Real Estate calls to offer you a bargain on a beautiful house in the English countryside
However, What makes this film slightly unusual for Lynch is the fact that it looks very raw, almost amateurish
But i believe Lynch does this on purpose to give a greater sense of realism, which serves to increase the intensity of surreal moments
<br /><br />However, a lot of Typical Lynch motifs are present, such as: floating camera work; haunting music; long (excruciating) pauses; hanging curtains; dim lights growing darker at a slow (almost indiscernible) pace; extreme close ups; themes of women in trouble; over-bearing, incompassionate, all knowing characters facing off with characters who are distraught, temporarily oblivious, in the dark and so on
<br /><br />The performances are great and the short is thought provoking
As usual, Lynch leaves almost everything up to interpretation
Many questions are left unanswered and this ignites the imagination
<br /><br />Another brilliant effort from Lynch
I only hope he makes some shorts, more along the lines of his sony playstation 2 commercials
yes some parts are lame and exceptionally convenient, and the movie doesn't really justify the large star cast (AB, SD, Tanuja)
However, the actor that really impressed me here was Kay Kay Menon (not to be confused with the singer KK)
In the scene where he first meets Amitabh's character, I thought that a man who can just look at AB, keep staring and not say a word, and still look strong, is definitely a good actor
In fact, he has proved himself worthy again in Sarkar, alongside AB for a second time
This guy should get more roles, he's brilliant
<br /><br />If you've read any of the other reviews here on IMDb, you already know the plot, and I do agree that Akshaye Khanna's entry into Pakistan was a little too easy
And the little love angle he shared with "what's-her-face" was completely unnecessary
But he is a fairly good actor (as seen in DCH), Sunjay Dutt is cool to watch, always
I don't know if I'm his biggest fan in the world, but I know I can definitely compete for the spot
<br /><br />An interesting watch, considering it's Bollywood, although a bit inspired by Hollywood oldies like "the Great Escape" and "Bridge on the River Kwai"
How can anyone not love this movie ? I think it's a hilarious spoof of all the old gangster movies; if you've never seen them, watch this instead
Michael Keaton has a ball in this role as anything goes
One guy mangles the English language everytime he talks and Griffin Dunn plays a clueless D
, but my favorite role has got to be Joe Piscopo
Danny DeVito, Alan Hale, Ray Walston are in this star-studded movie that lampoons gangsters a lot funnier than "Mafia" did for the criminal underground
It is totally incredible, unbelievable, impossible
But it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized, even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his phantasms
Of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals you can get to on the Internet
You must not believe ten percent of what you're told there and never, ever, ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally
Most of their "businesses" there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you
But here the chap deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive, he is absurdly silly
But then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his victimizer and winning
Security in English airports is not exactly what it should be, but I guess it's not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and regulations it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them systematically
Then they have their vengeance by losing your luggage, a real plague on modern airports, and don't expect to get fair compensation
Or even confiscating a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous
I can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener
Funny, isn't it? Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yveline
Julie Waters is always marvelous but Adrian Pasdar is a positive revelation in this wry gender-bent comedy about a transvestite who cannot suppress his obsession, and the changes he goes through when he's discovered
Unerringly eschews the vulgar, raucous easy jokes for genuine wit and true insight, and has an absolute ball while doing it
This is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by Hollywood
What a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of American history
Corbett especially interesting is that Mr
Corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day
But getting back to the movie, all the performances were excellent
And although it's a period piece, the story withstands the test of time; it has not gone stale
Sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic, well-staged and highly effective
That coupled with a great script makes this movie a must
I never watched the 'Next Action Hero' show, and until reading the other comments here, did not know that this movie was the 'prize' from that competition
I was just flipping channels and came across this, and found myself watching, dare eagerly, all the way to the end
<br /><br />Yes, the plot's been done (The Most Dangerous Game, etc
) but I was hoping for, and almost received, the 'gotcha' - how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end
I think the high-tech was overdone (GPS's) and gave me cold-sweat flashbacks of Night Rider, but it nevertheless was not too overdone
<br /><br />The basic problem I had with this movie was the degree of SOD (Suspension of Disbelief) that was required of the viewer
Do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenades at a public bridge and NO COPS show up to investigate? Could a limousine do countless donuts in a Las Vegas intersection and NO COPS show up? Pleeease
Way too much of that type of thing - fun to watch, but keep it at least plausible, thank you very much
<br /><br />The final solution was good, but the ending was disappointing, with the after taste of a bad Star Trek episode
At least now I understand why the acting was so cheesy - except for Zane, who doesn't get near as much work as he deserves IMHO - they were winners from a reality show
I have always been a fan of David Lynch and with this film Lynch proved to critics that he has the talent, style, and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that he's become known for in the past decade
As much as the film is G-rated, it's pure Lynch in style, pacing, and tone
The film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power
<br /><br />The cinematography is terrific, as is to be expected from a Lynch film, and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking
It's also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly, kindhearted folk and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as being either "good" or "evil"
<br /><br />Richard Farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast, most notably Sissy Spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher, and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role
<br /><br />With this film, David Lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80's with 'Blue Velvet' and 'The Elephant Man'
Critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' and 'Lost Highway' but with this film he showed that there was method to FWWM and LH, and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film 'Mulholland Drive', considering the high praise it's received and the Oscar nomination for Lynch
<br /><br />'Straight Story' is to me one of the most moving motion pictures I've ever seen
It's a loving story about family, friendship, and the kindness of strangers
Emory is a Cincinatti steel worker like his father before him and for most of the 20th century the twin pillars of his family's existence have been the steel mill and the union
The mill, which once employed 45,000, has seen its numbers dwindle to 5,000 recently and now 1, as the plant just shut its doors, leaving a single security guard
At first, newly-unemployed Emory and his pals enjoy their independence, hanging out around town and carousing at their favorite bar, where they down "depth charges" with reckless abandon
They think the mill will reopen after listening to their union rep's optimistic spiel, but reality starts to sink in when they find themselves selling their personal vehicles in a struggle to put food on the table and stave off foreclosure of their homes
Emory's father - a dedicated union man - is sure the plant will reopen and recalls for his son all the short-lived closures during his own 35 years at the mill
Meanwhile, some of the unemployed men take demeaning make-work jobs or hop in their trucks and take off in a desperate search for employment
<br /><br />Finally the union admits its helplessness, as Emory explains to his stubborn father that times have changed and that the mill won't ever open again
Emory tearfully asks "What did I do wrong?" as a lifetime of hard work and devotion to job, union, church and family have left him with nothing and nowhere to turn
He hits rock bottom when in a drunken rage he manhandles his young sons and knocks his wife to the floor
Tossed out of his own home and stinging from the plant manager's comments that he and his men didn't work hard enough to justify their substantial paychecks, Emory recruits the steel workers still left in town to do something that will demonstrate to all what they are capable of
Early in the morning they break into the mill, fire up the furnaces and work harder than they ever have in their lives, producing in one shift enough high-quality steel pipes to fill the loading docks from wall to wall, top to bottom - something the plant manager thought was impossible
<br /><br />Arriving at the suddenly-reopened plant, the stupefied manager looks around him at the tremendous output that came from a single day's work, realizing that production like this could make the plant profitable again
The manager asks Emory: "Can you do this every day?" Emory is forced to nod "No" and the manager asks: "Then what were you trying to prove?" Emory explains that the workers' decades of hard work, honesty and devotion to their jobs had meaning and that by showing how much they could produce in one day "We just spit in your eye
" Emory bids a tearful farewell to his wife and kids as he takes off with his buddies to look for work down south, promising to relocate the family when he finds it
<br /><br />This is a powerful and honest treatment of the plight of American workers displaced by foreign competition and gives a realistic view of the costs they bear for the short-sightedness of concession-demanding unions and greedy plant owners who extracted every penny they could from their factories but never gave back by modernizing them
Peter Strauss as Emory, John Goodman as his best friend, Gary Cole as his college-boy brother, Pamela Reed as Emory's sympathetic wife and John Doucette as his dying father all turn in excellent performances in this fine picture
Story had a unique and interesting arrangement
The absence of violence and sex was refreshing
Characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings
I agree with the previous comment in naming the film's content "everyday madness" but would like to specify that: "Dog Days" is about how women are treated in (a male) society
The episodes we get to see here show some variation in everyday discrimination of women, mostly categorized by age group
There is a senior man who makes his new partner look and act the way his late wife had, treating her like a doll that shall act "worthy of wearing" the former's dress
There is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship she is nearly a slave and he a (violent) master
Further we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friend/wife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitor(s)
A young adult man makes clear to his friend - a girl who is really troubled by being pretty enough for him - that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed rules of etiquette
Finally there is a man in his late fifties who calculating his own advantage delivers a simple-minded hitchhiking woman to a furious client who - taking her for guilty in having scratched his car - natural beats her up
To complete the examples we find the pal of the man in the "master-slave"-couple - after collectively abusing her - threatening and humiliating the former "in her sake" for she shall get rid of her partner and take himself as her new "master"
During all this the inhabitants of the lately built neighborhood in which the action takes place rests under the burning summer-sun - absolutely motionless (sic!)
Unfortunately I have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic portray of the archaic structures that still reign in the relationship between women and men, but what I have seen convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination
Probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sensitive spectator what goes wrong - due to good visualization
But the acting is amazing and Melissa Joan Hart is as cute as a button
I love this show a lot, and I'm almost embarrassed that I do b/c the show has a rep
for being really corny, but it makes me feel good
My only problem is that sometimes it can be pretty low budget - sometimes actors change and you just have to deal with it
Like Sabrina's father is 2 different guys throughout the course of the movie
I mean, couldn't they just say he was an uncle or something? Still, I can't help but loving this show
Harvey and Sabrina make a really cute couple and Salem is absolutely hilarious
I definitely recommend it if your looking for some light and funny entertainment
I'm not really a fan of some of the seventh season twists
Once you get to college, Morgan joins the group and her dialog is painful and very poorly acted
Plus she is ugly, so the jokes about how she is only surviving off her good looks were lost on me
But I think it was set up to have a really good eighth season and I was really sad to see one of my favorite shows canceled
While the prices have gone up a lot, and some of the details have become dated, any homeowner who's struggled with problems of homeownership should get a lot of chuckles out of this movie
Blandings, a New York ad executive, decides to move his family to the Connecticut suburbs and build himself a nice house there
He gets into one hilarious jam after another, from mortgages to lawsuits to construction difficulties, as the costs and schedule of the construction keep escalating out of control
I thought that the funniest scenes were where Blandings hires a contractor to dig a well for water
They dig down hundreds of feet, but never find water
Yet only a short distance away, a few days later, the basement of his house-to-be floods!<br /><br />Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give believable performances as the harried Blandings couple overwhelmed by problems they never imagined, and Melvyn Douglas is even better as Blanding's lawyer and family friend
<br /><br />The only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948
Blandings is portrayed as a bit of a naive dimbulb who has no idea how much additional trouble she's causing, and there's a black maid (horrors!)
So don't watch this movie through the social lens of 2003, and you'll enjoy it all the more
This is one horror movie based TV show that gets it right
Friday the 13th the series had no connection to the movies
It may have been loosely connected to the movies
It feels like they just throw a famous title on a show so fans will watch it
<br /><br />It shows Freddy being burned by the Elm street parents(in the 1st episode I believe) and the amount of parents were disappointing
With all the kids he targeted in the 1st 3 movies, you'd expect there to be more parents
<br /><br />Freddy is basically the narrator for the show
He watches the actions of people in the real world sometimes getting involved somehow
Just like other anthology shows like Tales from the crypt, there's a supernatural or surprise ending twist involved
<br /><br />The acting lacks but believe it or not: the violence sometimes surpasses that of the movie
This show lasted a couple of seasons and was made around the time of the 4th movie
i heard it was canceled due to protesting parents
I watched a lot of R rated stuff as a kid, so its a shame parents had to ruin it for everyone
4 more movies came after the series , so it wasn't a total loss
I have seen the short movie a few years ago
The first one is really not the best - but it's the most popular one
I've already watch the making of Guinea Pig 1
Also the sequels are excellent in the special effects
I recently watched the '54 version of this film with Judy, and while i appreciated the story and music, i found that the film failed to hold my attention
I expected the '76 remake to be the same story, except with a Barbra twist
I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame, money, love and the price of it all
This version is so much more real than the '54 one, with arguably better music, better acting, a more gripping plot line, and, of course, a deeper love
I do not understand why the previous film is on the American Film Institute's top 100 list, while this gripping remake fails to make a mark on any critic's list
My favorite Beatle is Paul and my least favorite is John
I already knew quite a bit about the Beatles music and the truth behind the breakup, as well as things like John Lennon's family and Paul's band Wings
I was curious to see how this movie would handle the relationship between John and Paul so many years after the breakup
<br /><br />I was not disappointed by this movie
Although the story itself is fiction, many of the references that the two musicians used were very accurate
These included how Yoko Ono would always be with John wherever he went, the Wings song "Silly Love Songs" being the number one hit that year and the concert on the roof of Apple Studios playing music from the album "Let It Be
"<br /><br />The actors did a very good job in playing John and Paul
The accents could had used maybe a bit more work, but they seemed to act a lot like I've read the two former-Beatles used to act like
I also liked the dialogue between them, which was basically what the entire movie was
<br /><br />The ending at first disappointed me, but the more you think about it the more you will appreciate it, especially since this was how it really went in real life
They also show the fantastic skit from "Saturday Night Live" in which the Beatles are offered $3,000 to perform on the show
(as compared to the $220 million others were offering them) Overall, I was not disappointed with this movie
It does really give you more of a feel for why the Beatles broke up and why they never got back together
By Hook or By Crook is a tremendously innovative film from a pair of immensely smart and talented filmmakers, Harry Dodge and Silas Howard
They manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style, and it's beautifully shot by Ann T
Rosetti, and wonderfully written -- truly poetic
<br /><br />The lead characters are true heroes and serve as a rare kind of role model/inspiration for butch dykes and trannies everywhere
This film has so much energy, so much poignant passion and scruffy San Francisco heart to it
I can't recommend it highly enough! <br /><br />The best butch buddy movie of all time
Barjatya after the movie Main Prem Ki Deewani hoon, then a year back now I saw promos for Vivah which looked good
But I didn't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema
When the film first came out on DVD I rented it and watched and I loved the movie and took back my words for Sooraj
I just finished watching it yesterday again and this time I thought I have to review this movie
BarjatyaGot it right this time, okay I was not a huge fan of Hum App Ke Hai Kaun
But I have always loved Manie Pyar kiya, after Manie Pyar kiya to me I think Vivah is Barjatyas best work
I hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying
If you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie, the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it, my view a much underrated movie
<br /><br />The story of this movie you might call desi and very old times, but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it's an old tradition
It's done in present times, lots of people don't believe in this arrange marriage, but I do
The journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly
When Prem meets Poonam for the first time, they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way Prem and Poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen
It was a very sweet, you feel nervous yet excited, the song "Do Ajnabe" shows that very well
Getting back to the story yes it's a journey which you soon get glued to between Prem and Poonam (Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao) and there families
A twist occurs in this movie which is really good, the last 30mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box
<br /><br />What makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between Prem and Poonam, how they fall for each other is too sweet
Simple boy and Simple Girl, when they first meet during and after the song "Do Anjane Ajnabe" It's very sweet to watch, She hardly says anything and Prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking
Then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that's when they really do fall for each other
It makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have
Another factor is that Poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for Poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness, you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with Poonam more then just Prem
When she finds happiness through Prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl
Which brings me to performances and Amrita Roa as Poonam is amazing in the movie, her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness
Shahid Kapoor as Prem is amazing too, he is Poonam support in the film, he is her happiness the movie, together they share an amazing chemistry and I have never seen a cuter couple since SRK and Kajol
If Ishq Vishk didn't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will
"Mujhe Haq hai" the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show
Scenes which touched me was when Prem takes Poonam to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet
Again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to
The film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever
<br /><br />The direction is spot on, to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them
To me this film pulled me in and for those three hours I felt really connected to the movie
The songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after I saw the movie I been playing the songs non stop! The music is amazing, the story is simply amazing too what more can I ask for?<br /><br />What I can finally say it, rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good, this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person
Its basically the sweetest journey ever, its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it's the bestest part of your lifeWell this movie actually shows you way do people actually say that? Why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing! Watch this movie and you will find out why the journey is amazing
A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause) have moved into a small town, and must deal with a mean teacher (Glenn Shadix), their incestuous relationship, a lovely girl (Mädchen Amick) and one hell of a big secret
<br /><br />Okay, so technically, this is a "bad film"
But, who cares? It's so very fun! <br /><br />Impossible things (involving corn) happen, people freak out about kitty cats, there's bad one-liners, there's too much cheese to handle!<br /><br />So, yes
It won't move you, touch you, scare you, or thrill you in any way, but it will keep you entertained and laughing
If people didn't know who Barbra Streisand was before this,
they sure knew who she was after!<br /><br />This show went on to win 5 Emmys, & stands out as one the best things Streisand has ever done
Barbra singing standards from room to room, filled with musicians, including a segment where she is a little girl again,all ending with a splendid version of her signature song,(at the time)
A musical tour of Bergdoff-Goodman,while Barbra Sings poverty songs
The best part, Just Barbra,musicians,& some great songs,like
"Happy Days Are Here Again",& a "Funny Girl" medley
<br /><br />all in all, a great part of television history,made by one of the greatest performers in the world
At times, this overtakes The Thing as my favourite horror film
While Carpenter's film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick, Kubrick's is more artistic, more thought-provoking, and probably scarier
It's one of the few films where I can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it
I try not to compare it to the book  which I've only read once, a number of years ago, and which scared me to death  because the two don't have a lot in common, besides the story and characters obviously
It's almost as if Kubrick was banking on people's love of the novel in order to make his film more frightening
And it that way, it's certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations ever made, as well as one of the greatest horror films
<br /><br />What makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares, not the blood and gore, not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time
Some people have complained about the casting of Nicholson in this role, saying that it's too obvious that he's going to go crazy in the film, given his past roles and his appearance
We know he's going to go crazy  since most of us have read the book  and Jack's appearance only furthers this notion
But it's the way he acts at the beginning that makes us truly scared
He engages in inane small talk with the hotel managers and even with his own family
And with a wife and son as irritating as his, it's a small wonder that he manages to do so
But once he gets to the Overlook, he changes
The scene that always shocks me is when Wendy interrupts him typing, and he utterly loses it, telling her to "leave him the f*** alone"
This is the first f-bomb dropped in the film, and it's a shock to the system
<br /><br />Another thing I love is the multiple interpretations present in the film
We're never really sure if what we're seeing is actually happening
Many critics have noted that whenever Jack talks to a ghost, there's a mirror present, showing that he may as well be talking to himself
But what of the other characters? Wendy never sees anything until the film's climax, until she is given a tour of the hotel's many ghostly inhabitants, but she is well aware that something is wrong, while Danny connects with the place almost immediately
His psychic powers are not in question  how else would Hallorann know to come to the hotel?  but does he ever see any of the ghosts that his parents witness? It's easy to claim that Jack merely loses it, being trapped in a hotel with his family, and Wendy later does as well  seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that  but what of Danny? It appears that his body is taken over by Tony, but how do we know for sure? None of these characters are reliable witnesses
Hallorann probably would be, and he warns of the dangers in 237, but he's killed as soon as he arrives at the Overlook (a scare Kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel)
Has there ever been a more enigmatic ending in cinema? Has Jack really been there before? Or was his body merely 'absorbed' into the hotel? When talking about the acting in this film, any discussion begins and ends with Jack Nicholson
Shelley Duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history  probably on purpose, to give Jack's character more of a reason to snap  and Danny Lloyd is no better, but Jack is a powerhouse
Part method, part improvisation, he's simultaneously terrifying and appealing
For better or for worse, he's the character with whom we identify with, not the annoying kid or nagging wife
We all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season, be able to do whatever we want
Who cares if it's haunted? Of course, the technical aspects are terrific
Kubrick's long takes, strange angles, and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror
The use of colour, mirrors, long hallways, and every other motif only heightens this
And don't even get me started on that score
I don't know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting, electronic tune
Its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel, the mood, and the entire film itself
<br /><br />I know King doesn't like this film, but King's input on cinema is nothing to brag about
As great of a novel writer he may be, his screenplays are terrible, and his attempt at directing is better left unnoticed
This is not a very faithful book adaptation, but it doesn't need to be, and it really shouldn't
Part of the horror of the film is that the viewer doesn't have the book to fall back on; there's no reassuring source material
Kubrick masterfully alters the narrative to terrify the audience even more
If only for that, this is one of the most innovative films in any genre
And it's got everything else on top of that
There are too many new styles of the sitcom but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set
When the show came on the air, nobody really heard of Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp much less the adolescents played wonderfully by Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both of them are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests) I wish Topher would stay around because the show began about his character, Eric, and his close circle of friends
Ashton is already the John Travolta of our time
Remember when John was in love with Diana Hyland from Eight Is Enough, think of Ashton with Demi Moore
The cast of actors were never known to us which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it
I miss Mo Gaffney who played Don's girlfriend Joanne
I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie, the replacement could not match her and I am sorry about that
I liked the casting of Tommy Chong as the wasted but beloved father figure to Steven Hyde
I loved watching Tanya Roberts besides Charlie's Angels
I loved Brooke Shields playing Jackie's mom
She really showed her acting talent before heading to Broadway
This show has been a delight with many surprises
I hope this show lasts longer even though 2 of their cast members are leaving but I hope they don't stay too far away too long
I wish the show's creators, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created my other favorite show, Third Rock from The Sun, is more successful on Fox than they were on NBC which sabotaged their show
The Turners are not dummies and I hope they create more shows like this in the future
Brief Encounter by David Lean (1945), UK<br /><br />Well, when a woman goes to a railway station, something may happen
And it happened! How she longed to be there, in a little tavern waiting for the man of her dreams
the man was a stranger to the fantasizing woman<br /><br />2
Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun by Fei Mu (1948), China<br /><br />Well, when a woman goes to the market to buy fish, grocery and medicine, passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, there is much to think about, about the melancholy of her life, her sick husband in self-pity and lack of future
Just when a jubilant young doctor arrived, something happened
the doctor was a high school honey of the fantasizing woman<br /><br />In both movies, from great directors of UK and China, the passion vs restraint was so intense, yet in the end the intimate feelings had not developed into any physical contacts
That leaves you with a great after-taste, sniffing it intensely without biting it
I really enjoyed this film because I have a tremendous interest in American History
the Antebellum years and the Civil War in particular
I purchased it recently from a rack of previously-viewed videos on sale at the supermarket and I was very glad to add this one to my history video collection
Though not of the caliber of Civil War films such as "Glory" or "Gettysburg," provides a lot of history on the pre-Civil War brotherhood among cadets at West Point
<br /><br />Maybe it's the gray uniforms, the youth, or the military discipline, but I am fascinated by the story of the Corps of Cadets from around 1830 to the brink of the War
I imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young men, learning how to make war, then later putting the lessons to use against your own classmates!<br /><br />Actually, there were two classes graduated in 1861: one class in May, the other in June
the movie makes no real mention of this, except to mention Henry A
DuPont, first graduate of the May Class; and George Custer, last grad of the June Class
the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war, but it was the result of switching back to a four-year course of study, after a few years of experimenting with a five-year course (I think the first class had attended five years, the other for four)
As the movie portrays, cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other
George "Fanny" or "Autie" Custer; Alonzo "Lon" Cushing; James "Beauty" Stuart (for J
<br /><br />I say this film is "Santa Fe Trail" as it should have been because that 1940 film, while enjoyable, really fudges history
Cadets from several different classes are all graduating together
JEB Stuart and George Custer are portrayed as the best of friends and are side-by-side in stopping John Brown's 1859 insurrection at Harper's Ferry
In fact, Stuart and Custer were never friends, but enemies during the War
They faced each other (for the first time, I think) at Gettysburg in 1863 (Stuart was at the Harper's ferry Raid, but Custer was still a cadet at the Point when it took place)
<br /><br />"Fanny" Custer plays a role in "Class of '61," though his classmate chums, Dev O'Neill and Shelby Peyton are fictional
I believe they are respectively based on Partick Henry O'Rorke and John Pelham, two people you can look up
<br /><br />Anyway, I truly enjoy this film or any film which provides a window into mid-19th Century America
Though this series only ran a season, it has stayed with me for 20 years
It was by far and above my all time favorite cartoon ever
I would give nearly anything to have it on DVD or whatever format I can get
If you find any means of seeing this series I suggest you take full advantage
This series was the first one (in my opinion) that had a truly coherent storyline that spanned across multiple episodes
It also made me truly care about the characters and what happened to them
Heck the character Goose actually scared me sometimes
Also the leader of the group reminds me a lot of a combination of Clint Eastwood/Tommy Lee Jones
If anyone has any way of contacting the creator/holder of the rights to the series and can get them put out on DVD please by all means do so!!
Many people have commented that this movie was nowhere near as good as the first
However, how does your child react to it? Well, mine loved it more than the first
<br /><br />Disney movies of the past can sometimes be a little harsh for little kids
(For example - Bambi's mother getting shot
) This movie was really great for my sensitive little girl who likes humor and happy endings
<br /><br />If you want to be snobby about what should be Disney's standards based on the past - skip this movie
<br /><br />If you have a sweet little girl or soft-hearted little boy you really want to please, buy this movie and treat your small children
This film is great as a bedtime movie for happy dreams instead of nightmares
I'm happy with a movie that pleases my kid & doesn't need to impress the parents all the time
This dumb comedy really does a good job of wasting comedic talent
In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are misused badly here
I might have chuckled once or twice during this film, but in general, it's a boring movie, with a little bit of stupidity thrown in for good measure
The premise, although routine, still wasn't bad, but once the plot was set, the film went nowhere
I can only assume that the other reviewers of this "film" are stockholders in the production company, as this was quite possibly the worst movie I've seen in the last five years
From the opening shot of a Rabbi laughing uncontrollably for no apparent reason, it was clear that the actors in this film would kill to be considered "B-Level
" Both my wife and I were in a great mood before starting this film, and we were genuinely looking forward to a funny popcorn movie
We knew we hadn't rented Citizen Kane, and we weren't expecting to see the most amazing movie ever
However, after 40 minutes of enduring the most painfully unfunny bit of garbage I've ever seen, we shut it off instead of wasting another minutes of our lives
<br /><br />If a "comedy" with no laughs, terrible acting, thin plot and annoying characters are your thing, then this film is for you
Honestly, Troll 2 is better--at least I laughed at the popcorn sex scene
<br /><br />I cannot justify writing a longer review of this picture because I've already wasted almost an hour trying to find one joke
I was babysitting a family of three small children for a night and their mother gave me this to show for them having just grabbed it at Wal-Mart earlier in the week
All three children actually got physically ill while watching it
I'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate, or something they all had picked up from school, but really it could have been this film
How any one can produce this caliber of trash is beyond me
Fortunately, I turned off the film when I noticed the children were not responding and acting strangely
For any parents out there, I strongly advise you to refrain from letting young children view this movie
Cliché upon cliché is confirmed and story lines never come together
It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary
The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting
So, a kid dies, which results in the "natural" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death
The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and keeps him around, why, no one knows
Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship
<br /><br />All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while
I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged
I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause
It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie
Not only is it a disgustingly made low-budget bad-acted movie, but the plot itself is just STUPID!!!<br /><br />A mystic man that eats women? (And by the looks, not virgin ones)<br /><br />Ridiculous!!! If you´ve got nothing better to do (like sleeping) you should watch this
a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like "Debbie does Dallas"
I think my main complaint is about the most unattractive lead actress in porn industry ever
Even more terrible is that she is on screen virtually all the time
But I read somewhere that back in those days, porn had to have some "artistic" value
See it only if you are interested in history of development of porn into mainstream, or can appreciate art in porn movies
But the director of the movie appears to be a talented person
He even tried to get Simon & Garfunkel to give him permissions to use his songs
How the Grinch Stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy, I never did see the reason for a remake
Not to mention a remake that was made with humans, the cartoon was just perfect enough, what's the purpose of this film? But it also seemed a little odd for Jim Carrey to be the Grinch
I mean he's a great comedic actor, but him as the Grinch? It just didn't make any sense to me
His performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments
Not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable
The whole story of the Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was over done and wasn't needed
They actually just destroyed the story, period
<br /><br />All the who's in Whoville are getting ready for their best Christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly
But Cindy Lou-Who is curious and worried about the Grinch that lives above them and that he's not going to get as good of a Christmas as the other who's
He kicks her out and decides that he doesn't want Christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal Christmas all together to show the who's what his version of Christmas is all about
But soon he realizes that the who's may know that it's a little bit more than what is the materialized version of Christmas
<br /><br />How the Grinch Stole Christmas wasn't needed and was a bit over the top
I really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version, at least in my opinion
The make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done, not to mention that How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring Jim Carry
But at least this version makes you grateful for the Boris Karloff version that is played every Christmas
Yeah, Madsen's character - whilst talking to the woman from the TV station - is right: the LAPD IS a corrupt, violent and racist police
Okay, here are the good cops, the moral cops, even a black one, whow, a Christian, a martyr
And most important for the action fans: The shoot out is boring
It's just shooting and shooting and shooting
Play Counter Strike, then you will at least have something to do
The only moral of this film is: The LAPD is good now
If you like uncritical, euphemistic commercials for police and military service, watch this movie
It's the longest commercial I've ever seen
This production never really got off the ground for me
The plot is so cut up as to be disjointed and the production is so short that unless you've read the novel or seen a better adaptation (like the 1995 one with Amanda Root) you're going to be a bit lost since there's no time for character development
<br /><br />I liked Sally Hawkins as Anne, but the rest of the cast fell rather short of what they should have been
Croft was far too old, as was Anne's elder sister Elizabeth
Mary uttered everything in such throbbing accents that the general peevishness and selfishness of her character was lost
Much better was Sophie Thompson's Mary, whose selfishness and sense of ill-usage is so well established that by the time Wentworth suggests Anne stay with the injured Louisa and Mary objects that she, as Louisa's sister in law, should stay instead, you can't imagine anyone less suited to do so
In this version, she might as well stay as she is insufficiently differentiated from anyone else in the production
<br /><br />Rupert Penry-Jones is nice to look at, but he made a much better St
John Rivers (1995 Jane Eyre), probably because that character required less implied depth of feeling
I agree with the comments made earlier about the gig scene: seemed more like he was trying to get rid of Anne than do her a favor
Likewise the accident scene: it happens so fast and with so little context, you wonder what all the fuss is about
And moving the speech that Wentworth overhears in the novel to the beginning of this production is a critical misstep that only contributes to the disjointed nature of the script
<br /><br />My other problem with this version was the lighting
Sometimes everything looked like a scene from the CSI morgue -- very very blue
Other times the lighting was so bad it was hard to make out the scene very well, like when Anne visits her old school friend, Mrs
Smith (who, by the way, is supposed to be more or less paralyzed
Having her run up to Anne on the street to tell her of Mr
Elliot's awful character was such a violation that for a minute I couldn't think who she was -- I thought she was one of the Musgrove girls
All the girls were pretty much interchangeable)
in an era where propriety was at a premium, it's hard to imagine gentle Anne tearing all over Bath like some demented hoyden
Sally Hawkins had all the makings of a good Anne Elliot, but she was completely hamstrung by a poorly organized script and an over-truncated production
Steven Seagal movies have never been Oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse
<br /><br />This one starts with Seagal getting picked up by the FBI because he killed a few people 'in self defence' he's active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen Stealth plane that will be used by the cliché 'evil English villain' that Hollywood is so obsessed with including these days
<br /><br />Suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent
The story isn't interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story, characters of movie as a whole such as the 'lesbian' interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet isn't even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didn't need to
<br /><br />In short a terrible script with bad dialog, delivered by sub-par actors, boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes, and non-relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near-impossible and make the movie even worse
<br /><br />Save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss, even if you are Seagal's most ardent fan
There are some spooky moments but there aren't enough of them to make me ever want to see this movie again
There are some scenes you could fast forward through & not miss anything
The biggest flaw is that it is so predictable, & that is the reason why I rated it so low
It's watchable but don't expect anything great
Everyone in a while, Disney makes one of thoes movies that surprises everyone
One that keeps you wondering until the very end
In the tradition of Pirates of the Caribbean, this movie is sure to turn into a ghost, and kill and rape your village
If you want a mindless, senseless, predictable "action" movie, go right ahead
I believe that young kids might enjoy this, as they like it when Good ALWAYS wins
But me, I like movies where it's a toss up who's going to win
This movie never lets the Bad Guys have the upper hand
By the end, when th heroes are left in an "inescapeable" pit, you just KNOW that they can get out
Everything works out perfect for Cage and his friends, he never has to think over a riddle or clue for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complex it is
See this movie if you want to see some impressive set designs, not if you want to see good acting, or a good film
Go watch a superman movie, it would be much shorter, and the kids would like it more
For instance, the scene where Cage is fleeing from armed gunmen, and the bullets are all deflected by a the railing of a fire escape
(And I'm not talking about a fence or anything, just ONE LITTLE POLE) This movie shows the decay of films and the film industry to cheap gags and dull, unrealistic action, which this movie provides in huge quantities
You should never see this show If you see it on
Or you be cringing for the next 30 minutes
So now, if you ever wanna watch this show, please don't
Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place, or Nick for Drake & Josh, Those are much better family shows
So believe me on this, I've watched it before
and It is honestly, and I say Honestly, the worst show I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of TV
So do me a favor, and never watch this show
OK, my girlfriend and I rented the DVD and about 30 minutes into the movie, we'd exchanged a lot of "ehhh, what IS this movie about and more importantly, do I care to find out what it ends with" glances and decided we either needed drugs to keep us interested in the "plot" or just end the pain right there and then and watch something else
<br /><br />I liked "But I'm a Cheerleader" a lot, but Mango Kiss is too silly and surreal for my taste, sorry! I definitely prefer "D
S", "Better Than Chocolate", "Fucking Åmål", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire"
Films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning
While there are some exceptions, the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes
The kids in Paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds, as they're both very annoying and they don't have an ounce of acting ability between them
This isn't good considering that they're the leads, and it especially isn't good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors
It's a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isn't (not completely)
It follows a young girl who, after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook, wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created
It soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings, and so sets about making various changes, until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare
<br /><br />As you can see, this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie
However, it is squandered through a number of fatal faults
First and foremost, in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness; the movie is extremely stale
The central plot is hardly played with at all, and the result is an entirely boring experience
The lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie, as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just don't care any more (which is due to a lack of ideas)
Thanks in part to it's lead characters, the film feels like a kids movie throughout
This is to be expected as it stars kids, but Bernard Rose should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story; as the horror in the movie is laughable at best
The film is also very cheesy, and the 'romance' between the two leads is extremely cringe-worthy, and makes for very painful viewing
In fact, if I had to sum this travesty up in one word, I would choose 'painful'
Paperhouse is poorly acted, laughably plotted, very corny and dull on the whole
Save yourself the pain, see something else
Whale-hunters pick on the wrong freaking whale
<br /><br />A group of yahoo whale exploitists capture a female and string her up by her tail-fin
The whale's mate sees the whole thing including the moment the female's unborn baby slips out and slops onto the deck
'Captain Nolan' (Richard Harris) could tell that the big male is really mad by the way it stared him down as if to say, "Get out of town before high-tide
" <br /><br />This story of revenge has Harris' presence and Bo's beauty, but not much else
This was Bo's first 'released' film, though her first acting job was four years previous in 'And Once Upon a Love' released in 1981 as 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek)
Today, the date of this review (November 20), is Bo Derek's birthday
This movie has a slew of great adult stars but fails to get you interested in a way an adult film should
Among all the stars you couldn't get your kicks from any of the scenes
The movie is shot in a dream like middle age set which is embarrassingly cheesy
The acting is worse than Keanu Reeves, the sex scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbor talk about their kid in college, and the dialogue is the worse I have seen in a movie
The audio commentary was useless since it's a skin flick but even then that was bad too
Unless your a diehard Jenna Jameson fan there is little here
If you like films that are totally bizarre, then this one is for you! Abdullah is one mean mother, with a passion for strangling people and eating ham
You should check this film out, just for a laugh
It is a low budget sci-fi, musical, comedy, cannibalistic, classic
If you get bored of the film half way through you should persevere, just for the sake of seeing the aliens, which are nothing more than little toy robots, but in my opinion are the films highlight
I watched the Malayalam movie "Boeing Boeing" made in 1985 (which in turn is probably inspired by an English movie of same name) long back
The basic story of garam masala is the same - but it is told in a pathetic way, the classy jokes replaced by routine ones which are found in normal Hindi movies (probably the director did this to suit the taste of Hindi audience)
<br /><br />I haven't seen the English original
But had really enjoyed the Malayalam film (made by Priyadarshan himself)which was a side splitting comedy, back then
Of course the acting by Mohanlal,Mukesh and Sukumari (who did the cook's role) was so natural and spontaneous
<br /><br />Probably, I am too smitten by the Malayalam film that I cannot tolerate even the smaller flaws in its Hindi remake
But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have overacted
Paresh Rawal has done a decent job - but doesn't reach anywhere near Sukumari
<br /><br />But all in all its OK, if one compares it to other recent Hindi comedy movies
Having read the comments on the site I feel compelled to write in for the first time
It seems this movie is like Marmite and has split the audience
I have to say that while I agree films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) they still have to engage you with the characters
Now while I was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch's opus, I have to say I couldn't give a turd about Mr Green or the other cardboard gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world
<br /><br />Also, while so many people seem to try and say you didn't enjoy because you didn't get it I would have to disagree - I didn't enjoy because I was bored
I wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help
Call it clever if you will - I think it's repetitious
<br /><br />However, my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the film I saw
Did I watch a dud print or is this evidence of GR's pretentiousness? Or, did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed??
then they will have a proper place to file this crap
Sorry, not a "mystery" as claimed, it is religious mumbo-jumbo
I kept waiting for the "unimaginable evil" that was promised me, but the "evil" in this flick would only be unimaginable by a five year old with learning disabilities
<br /><br />I can't believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this embarrassment
Unfortunately it has forevermore changed my opinion of them, and I will likely avoid anything they do in the future
I'm also a little cheesed off that I now have a writer's name and director's name to memorize as I'll be avoiding anything they do like the plague from now on too
<br /><br />It's really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc
This could lead to more people getting tricked, as I was, into believing this movie was something other than religious preaching
<br /><br />Well, it's off to the video store to get my money back for false advertising
Too bad they can't give me back the 105 minutes I wasted watching this thinking that it was actually a Hollywood horror/supernatural film
this movie had a fairly good sounding plot, but the paste was very slow
even if someone thinks this is a cult classic, i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched
<br /><br />the cinematography is not excellent, but not the worst either
<br /><br />i still wouldn't recommend this to anyone else than maybe a film-student
<br /><br />the movie does not contain music, and the horses having sex don't make it a good one either
and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was plain stupid
<br /><br />no winnings here, skip this utter boredom
i've seen worse believe me, but this is just waste of time, and i don't get the good reviews here
The British Public School system did not evolve solely with the idea of educating the upper classes despite that popular and widespread misconception
It was designed to produce administrators and governors,civil servants and military men to run the British Colonies
These people were almost entirely recruited from the middle classes
When the Public Schools had begun to show their worth the scions of the aristocracy were sent to them rather than be educated at home by tutors and governesses as had previously been the case
They tended to favour the schools nearer "Town" so Eton and Harrow became particularly popular with that class of parent
The vast majority of Public Schools took their pupils from lower down the social scale
Tom Brown,perhaps the most famous Public School pupil ever,was the son of a country parson,not a belted earl
Thus in late 1960s England,a country in the throes of post-colonial guilt and shedding the last of its commitments to its former dependants as quickly as Harold Wilson could slip off his "Gannex" mac,Lindsay Anderson's "If" was greeted with cathartic joy by the chattering classes and mild bemusement by everyone else
It must be remembered that the so-called "summer of love" was followed by the "October Revolution" a non-event that left a few policemen in London with bruised heads and the U
Embassy with one or two broken windows,but achieved absolutely nothing
So when Mr Anderson's film reached the cinemas the disgruntled former revolutionaries revelled vicariously in what they saw as Mr Malcolm McDowell's glorious victory over an amorphous "Them" despite the fact that he was ruthlessly gunned down at the end,a fate that would have undoubtedly overtaken them had they succeeded in their attempts to get into the U
The film told us nothing new about Public Schools,homosexuality,bullying cold showers,patrician sarcastic teachers,silly traditions
It was declared to be an allegory comparing Britain to the corrupt,crumbling society represented by the school
Well,nearly forty years on the same schools are still flourishing,the British social system has not changed,the "October Revolution" has been long forgotten except by those involved on one side or the other and Mr Anderson has completed his "State of the Country" trilogy to no effect whatsoever
If by any chance you should wish to read a book about schoolboys who did buck the system rather more successfully than Mr McDowell and his friends and furthermore lived to tell the tale,find a copy of "Stalky & Co
"written by the man whose much-maligned poem "If" lent it's name to Mr Anderson's film,a man born in colonial India,a man whose work is quietly being airbrushed out of our literary history
And do it before the chattering classes succeed in declaring him a non-person
Perhaps somebody should start a revolution about that
while being one of the "stars" of this film doesn't necessarily give me sage insight, i do know quite a bit of what was first there
i remember seeing the original cut of "incoming freshman" and being very pleased
it was funny, sexy, raunchy, all the main requirements of a drive-in film
you have to remember this was shot and released before all the rest
so in its own way, this flick was truly ahead of its time
for whatever reasons, the film was given to the main distributors who editing out half the original film, and then edited in (should i say "shuffled?") THE most random scenes ever
what the heck was all that?! i'm sure it was put in for additional T&A, but it was so slowly paced, it caused anything going on prior to it to grind to a screeching and painful halt
especially in that i'm able to say that the worst movie i've ever seen
Im proud to say I've seen all three Fast and Furious films
Sure,the plots are kinda silly,and they might be a little cheesy,but I love them car chases,and all the beautiful cars,and the clandestine midnight races
<br /><br />Wanna know what the difference is between those three and Redline?Decent acting,somewhat thought out plot,even if they are potboilers,and last but not least,directors who have a clue
All three were made by very competent directors,all of them took the films in a different direction,equally exciting
Redline looks like the producer picked out a dozen women he slept with on the casting couch,and made them the extras,then picked up his leads from Hollywood's unemployment line
<br /><br />Yeah,the movie had a few cool cars,but you don't really get to see that many in action,and the action is directed so poorly you cant get excited by the chases,and if the cars aren't thrilling you,why go to a movie like this?<br /><br />Im in the audience with a bunch of teenagers,and I cant stop laughing out loud
Im getting dirty looks,but this was just a debacle
Whatever you do,avoid Redline like bad cheese
I really do not have any clue as to why some people find the power rangers television show even remotely interesting at all
The costumes are completely ridiculous and the people playing in them also look completely foolish at the same time
There is absolutely anything remotely interesting about the power rangers
This is just a higher priced television commercial designed to sell extremely cheesy plastic garbage to the unsuspecting children around the world
From the notes, I can see that it's been banned in the country of New Zealand and from what I have seen, I can agree with their decision
Avoid this show at all costs, it's terrible and ridiculous
I love Columbo and have seen pretty much all of the episodes but this one undoubtedly ranks as the worst of the lot
A mind-bogglingly tedious, pointless, muddled pile of unwatchable drivel that wastes both the time of the viewing audience and of the acting talents of an exceedingly bored-looking Peter Falk
The 'plot', such as it is, just seems to be made up as the film goes along with not even the slightest hint of the ingredients to the formula that made the show such a brilliant success to start with
One part of the proceedings which I found extremely puzzling ( or possibly annoying ) was Peter Falk's character being introduced to the guests at the wedding as 'Lt' Columbo
If the producers insist on keeping Columbo's first name a secret, why couldn't they have omitted this line altogether as it sounds ridiculous? Like I said, this is the pits and all true Columbo fans would do well to avoid it like the plague
A typical Goth chick (Rainbow Harvest looking like a cross between Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George) gets even with people she feels have wronged her with the help of an old haunted mirror that she finds in the new house she and her mom (horror mainstay, Karen Black, the only remotely good thing about this travesty) buy
The acting's pretty laughably bad (especially when Rainbow interacts with the aforementioned mirror) and there are no scares or suspense to be had
This film inexplicably spawned thus for 3 sequels each slightly more atrocious than the last
People looking for a similarly themed, but far superior cinematic endeavor would be well advised to just search out the episode of "Friday the 13th: the Series" where a geeky girl finds an old cursed compact mirror
That packs more chills in it's scant 40 minutes than this whole franchise has provided across it's 4 films
<br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />Eye Candy: Charlie Spradling provides the obligatory T&
I've rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on DVD without reading any reviews about it
So, after 15 minutes of watching I've noticed that something is wrong with this movie; it's TERRIBLE! I mean, in the trailers it looked scary and serious!<br /><br />I think that Eli Roth (Mr
Director) thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid, the movie would be funny
? WRONG!) He should watch and learn from better horror-comedies such as:"Fright Night", "The Lost Boys" and "The Return Of the Living Dead"! Those are funny!<br /><br />"Cabin Fever" is THE reason why I registered to www
com so I can release my thoughts of discontent about it
<br /><br />I've decided to watch the movie a second time >AAARGH!< and make notes for my partial "review" to show how foolish the movie is
"Resident Evil" (horror) or "Dude, Where's My Car?" (comedy) I can watch over and over again and still enjoy! But this
!<br /><br />How bad can a script and a director be??? This bad
Here are the awful scenes in chronological order:<br /><br />In the early scenes we see Henry, who doesn't realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead-glazed stare is dead!<br /><br />The movie doesn't explain anything about the blonde long-haired kid who like to bite people
<br /><br />And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question ("What's wrong with the woods?") is "nothing"
The script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for "suspense"
<br /><br />Then the "smartest" of the 5-pack, Bert, almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire
He meets now-infected Henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the "F-word"
Bert starts to freak out because Henry looks awfully ill
Bert:"Don't make me shoot you!" (he forgets to add: "
with my BB gun!")<br /><br />Bert heads back to the cabin but how about that? He meets Marcy and Jeff who were having sex, but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk! Marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire Bert had started earlier (A moment of clarity for a change?) Bert doesn't mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his BB gun
<br /><br />Later, as the Five Estupidos sit around their campfire, another weirdo shows up with his dog
(Maybe that's what the warning about the woods is all about? It's filled with weirdos
and their dogs!?) They let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis
(Their brains are completely intoxicated! No wonder why they are all so DUMB!) This is the last time we'll see this forgettable character
alive!<br /><br />Henry shows up at their cabin, (NOTE: He was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin!!!) looking worse, almost like a zombie, covered in goo! He says he needs a doctor
But the Young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker
He gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition
Henry almost seems smart enough to drive the Hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard, seats and windows
The Fantastic Five come out running, armed with: a BB Gun, a knife, a baseball bat (*huh? Ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods???), a poker, and a (insecticide?) spray-can, ready to combat the single, unarmed and terribly sick man
(clever script!) Bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his BB Gun, which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth
"What else am I supposed to do?" Bert yells in his defense
Jeff and Paul try to knock Henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the truck's windows instead
Henry walks up to the dumb girls who say: "He's coming towards us!" (Thanks for the info, dumb broads, I can see that! But I don't think he wants to do you any harm!) Marcy sprays in his eyes, making Henry yelp! And our "hero" Paul touches Henry's arm with a burning log from the campfire, which they recklessly left burning while they were INSIDE the cabin! (Where has all that wisdom gone? I guess the cannabis had started to take its toll!:-) Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs away, screaming
<br /><br />The following day, Bert and Jeff head out for a mechanic
And Marcy decides to "go for help" all by herself, in the woods, as Paul stays behind with Karen
Doesn't that sound idiotic? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already "going for help"!<br /><br />I skip my comments now to how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE rowing over a huge and winding river! How did she get a canoe? Does she even know where she's going!? Anyway, she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and, like in most horror movies, walks inside the cabin saying:"Hello? Is anyone there?" Bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her (and me at first)
How did THEY get here!? Did they swim across the river??? Do you see how brainless the script is!?<br /><br />Deputy Winston meets Paul at the cabin
He somehow doesn't notice the blood on their truck
This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the DVD out
Now, THAT's funny!)<br /><br />If you liked this movie, do yourself a favor and watch "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys", or "The Return of The Living Dead"
Then you'll see they are MORE entertaining than this
Even the "Toxic Avenger part 2", which is also a lousy film, is way MORE funnier than "Cabin Fever"
I argued with myself whether to rent this or not
I'm always afraid of renting something I've never heard of (don't remember this being in theaters)
30 minutes in, I almost stopped watching it
The first few minutes are fun to watch, but unbelievable
The writers of this movie could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their movies even a little better
Or they could just try writing something just a little bit believable
a 1 for the writing (only because there are words)and a 2 for being able to get so many good actors to agree to do this movie despite having to read the script
well if you like horrors its definitely one to see, otherwise don't even bother
It is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget, For instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere, and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow, trust me you wont need to look for them
Also try to ignore the cheesy actors, if thats what you call them!!The basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being 3 killers on the loose and whoever live's at the end gets rich
Now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days,For example when i watched it i thought to my self i would'nt mind having a go at this game! especially for $12
so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind
This film is "riveting" but in much the same way a car crash is riveting
Overall, this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment--and a futile, biased experiment at that
The filmmakers are manipulative and seem to have no problems going for the lowest possible denominator
The manner in which the money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation
The intervening steps that the filmmakers force Ted to participate in (meeting with so-called experts) were empty and devoid of any substantive attempt to connect with Ted
Instead, it's painfully obvious that they serve to cover the filmmaker's posteriors and to further exploit Ted's situation
The worst part is that the filmmakers stop following Ted after 6 months; and seemingly are cut off entirely from the subject they had followed so closely months before
If they had cared, they would have found better "experts" to help Ted
If they truly wanted to see what Ted would do, then they should have let him spend the money without any intervention
This film is at best a high-brow Jackass stunt and not a documentary
It's sad to think how much $100,000 could have actually changed a homeless person's life had it been put in the right hands
Yea the girls are pretty but its not very good
The plot having a cowboy get involved with an Indian maiden would be interesting if the sex didn't get in the way
Well, okay it might be interesting, but its not, because its so badly paced and and only partly acted
I can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen, probably more laughable then they do on TV
(I won't even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest
Never read about that in the old west) This is a film that requires liberal use of fast forward
<br /><br />I like schlock films but this is ridiculous
There is a reason that I don't go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good, the plot taking a back seat to breasts
The original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats
The clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent
The comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level, infantile but harmlessly fun
Something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudie
<br /><br />The Ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex film
<br /><br />Of interest to probably no one, the rapist and killer in the film was played by Bobby Beausoleil, a member of the Manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrapped
<br /><br />Obviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives
<br /><br />How this film ever got a 6 star average is beyond me
The script is so banal, and frankly an insult to whomevers life it is based upon
The cinematography comes straight from the slick world of advertising, and the talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed
Demi Moore however, shows none a surprise by participating in this film, if one looks at her tracklist
All in all, a "high concept" style film that even Don Simpson would be ashamed of
"Meatball Machine" has got to be one of the most complex ridiculous, awful and over-exaggerated sci-fi horror films that I have ever came across
It is about good against evil and a coming-of-age tale, with the aim of to entertain with bloody, sleazy and humorous context
Because of that the violence isn't particularly gruesome and it doesn't make you squirm, but the gratuitous bloodletting and nudity does run freely
The performances by Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka is the worst i have seen, if that was not enough it is also directed by an unheard of director called Yudai Yamaguchi
This movie just have it all, it is bad to the bone!, A must see for every b-movie freak!!!
Three unlikable New York Lotharios, ruthless "scammers," end up wooing the same woman, played by Amanda Peet, with disastrous results
Too sophomoric to be misogynistic, flaccid and ridiculous, "Whipped" mixes the philosophies of shock jock Tom Lykis with Penthouse letter fantasies
Though technically proficient it's dated, grating, poorly written, mean, and obvious
In a nutshell: this is a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really WANTS and TRIES to be something more
It wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, The Graduate
It has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, editing, all of which give it the feel of an important movie
<br /><br />But here's what keeps it from ultimately being anything more than a formulaic late-night-cable, in-flight, time-killer: <br /><br />1
David Schwimmer -- how many times can Joe sad-sack puppy dog stare blankly into space with his jaw hanging open before it starts to get annoying? Maybe some drool would have helped
Gwenneth Paltrow -- she's really flat here and not just in the chest
Her role is supposed to be this lively, nice, caring girl who just keeps getting herself into wrong situations, is very confused as a result, and that is why a sad-sack loser like Schwimmer has any chance with her
Combine this with puppy-dog drool-face (above) and you have very little chemistry to care about
<br /><br />(I kept picturing someone else in this role -- Kate Hudson for example
The script and the plot -- the stuff that happens just basically doesn't ring true; all the problems get wrapped up in the end with such a neat and tidy bow on top that it seems like a whistle blew and the script writers just said "oops, time to wrap it up, got a train to catch!" So they pulled out the Hollywood formula book, checked off all the boxes, and went home
I must say that "Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" is one of the worst movies ever made
First of all, the movie was made during the height of Disney's sequel rampage
It was created around the same time as "The Little Mermaid II," "The Jungle Book II," and "Peter Pan II," all of which were disservices to their original film classics
(Disney also made "The Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II," but I'm going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place
") Let me go ahead and say that I am an avid supporter of good Disney films, and I absolutely adore the original Disney "Cinderella
" The sequel to "Cinderella," however, was a waste of time
The character of Cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that I grew up watching
In the original, Cinderella was kind and loving
The new Cinderella had very out-of-character moments with current-era phrasing like, "I'm going to do this banquet my way!" Let me also tell you that new Cinderella (as I have affectionately named her) says, "Ewww!" That is the anti-Cinderella
I try to find the best in people, but in the sequel, Anastasia, one of the stepsisters, is good! What the heck? Why? They made it all out to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just horrible family members for poor little Anastasia
My question to the world: did the people at Disney watch the original "Cinderella" when making this sequel? Well, it surely doesn't seem so
If I remember correctly, Anastasia was just as abusive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine
I am all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no point of redemption for Anastasia in this movie
I hope Disney realizes that this movie, among other movies, is shaming Walt Disney's name
Perhaps now that Michael Eisner is gone, things will start shaping up around the House of Mouse
Elmo's Fire" who just graduated from college barely seem able to make it through high school much less four years at any prominent university
For the most part, these kids are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and stupid, yet co-writer and director Joel Schumacher appears to hold them up as touchstones for a generation
With a now-outdated cast of "up and comers", a background score that sounds awfully similar to that of "Terms Of Endearment", and writing which lords the smugness of this circle over us, "Fire" is a paltry blaze, one that gets even more embarrassing as the years pass on
Rajinikanth becomes born again after getting a magical power which he can use seven times
<br /><br />There are several problems with this movie that are obvious to the casual audience: the 50ish Rajinikanth is still at home with his parents; the father of the girl next door thinks that he is a compelling "boy" ('vaseekaramaana paiyan'); Rajinikanth suddenly interrupts the movie with his sermons, the worst being how women of yesteryears got their exercise through household work--yet we are to believe that he is not a theist; even though he was well read, he wastes six of his seven powers on a stupid kite; I can go on, but you get the picture
<br /><br />There are god-men, there are gods, and there is Rajinikanth
The directory has difficulty fitting Rajinikanth into one of these categories
Initially, Rajinikanth is just Rajinikanth doing what Tamil heroes do--stand up to villains and, in spite of being the oldest, getting courted by the prettiest girl in the movie
Rajinikanth does this well and some of Rajinikanth's trademark styles are actually enjoyable--"baba count" is a novelty
What makes this movie unbearable is that those few initial minutes are just a preface to an worst book to be ever written
Even that preface is punctuated with some comedy which are forced and obvious
<br /><br />The director doesn't explain the purpose of the hero; we see that the hero is facing several hurdles (from politicians, as usual) but we can't really root for the hero because we don't know what the hero's ultimate goal is
At the end, when everyone wants him to be the leader, the hero gives another one of his sermons and walks away to become a hermit
The director offers no solution to the problem in the climax scene
Either he shows patches of brilliance or he didn't bother to invest himself fully into this movie--who can blame him
There is one scene where Rajinikanth steps into the van of one of the crooks and then throws the knife and starts his baba count
The music is very apt for the moment and acts as a catalyst adding further tension
The songs are all mediocre, no one would bother with the songs from this movie after a few years
<br /><br />Unfortunately, 1 is the lowest rank you can assign in IMDb
This movie has all the elements that justify its rightful place at the nether of IMDb's ranking
I saw this with a friend a while ago and we both consider ourselves open-minded to the many wonders of cinema, but this sure isn't one of them
<br /><br />While there very well could be some good ideas/concepts and there are certainly some good performances (under the circumstances), it is all buried under random nonsense
Sir Anthony draws way too heavily from the same gene pool as Natural Born Killers, U Turn and similar films as far as the editing is concerned, or maybe he watched himself in Nixon for inspiration
Say what you want about David Lynch, but at least he more often than not has a method to the madness
<br /><br />His quote of stating that he made the film as a joke says it all
It's not worth your money, bandwidth or time
Is this a stupid movie? You bet!! I could not find any moment in this film that was creepy or scary
Bad effects? Everywhere! Rick Baker may have gone and done bigger and better things, this is not one of them
He is the most whiny doctor I've ever seen
He's got a melting man running amok out in Ventura County somewhere, he's not overly happy that his wife is pregnant (probably cause she's 55 years old and weighs 90 lbs) and there's no crackers to be found anywhere
Plus he's got the not-too-helpful general on his hinder wanting to find astronaut Steve
And the local sheriff wants to know what's going on even though Mr
There also some random characters thrown in for good measure who encounter the melting man
Eventually the movie ends and out monster gets scooped into a trash can to become compost
In the end it's just what you need for a great MST episode
Also known in a different form as "House of Exorcism," this messy<br /><br />little film takes itself so seriously as to kill any entertainment value<br /><br />whatsoever
<br /><br />The spare plot involves European tourist Elke Sommer who has a<br /><br />chance run in with Telly Savalas, who looks just like the devil she<br /><br />saw on a fresco in the square
Sommer is given a ride to a<br /><br />mysterious house in the country, where Savalas happens to be<br /><br />butler
There, she is mistaken for a long dead woman, and the real<br /><br />soap opera theatrics begin
The house's blind matriarch's<br /><br />husband had an affair with the dead woman, who was the<br /><br />matriarch's son's fiancee
The couple who gave Sommer the ride?<br /><br />Well, the woman is giving the chauffeur, uh, "back seat driving<br /><br />lessons," and the husband knows and does not care
Eventually,<br /><br />most of the cast is killed, Sommer is drugged and raped,<br /><br />escapes, and the viewer is taken to a climax on board an empty<br /><br />airplane
which must have resembled the empty theaters this<br /><br />thing played in
<br /><br />The alternate version of this, "House of Exorcism," has scenes<br /><br />added involving a priest
<br /><br />The VHS copy of this, from Elite Entertainment, is crystal clear and<br /><br />letterboxed
There are "extras" after the end credits; deleted sex<br /><br />and gore scenes
<br /><br />Mario Bava's direction is fast and furious, but his screenplay is<br /><br />awful
There are half baked ideas, abandoned plotlines, and<br /><br />stunning conveniences that do nothing more than propel this thing<br /><br />in some sort of forward direction
You have life like dummies for<br /><br />practice funerals, the blind matriarch does not act all that blind,<br /><br />and Savalas is given the same lollipops he had in "Kojak," (who<br /><br />haunts ya, baby?)
<br /><br />The project seems like they had two name stars, then wrote the<br /><br />script quickly, something that happens in Hollywood on a daily<br /><br />occurrence now
Savalas looks completely lost, delivering his<br /><br />lines haltingly, and wishing his character had not died in "The Dirty<br /><br />Dozen
" Sommer runs around and screams and gasps a lot, but<br /><br />her character is a blank, I use the term "character" loosely
The<br /><br />only thing we know about her is her name
<br /><br />This is a real weird film, and your reaction to it might depend on<br /><br />how heavily you are into Eurohorror, and Kojak
I for one cannot<br /><br />recomment "Lisa and the Devil
"<br /><br />This is unrated, and including all the extras at the end of the VHS<br /><br />copy, contains strong physical violence, sexual violence, strong<br /><br />gore, strong female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, and adult<br /><br />situation
And being let down bigger than ever before
I won't make any direct references or anything here, but to say the least, this film is pathetic
If you're military trained, don't bother watching
I put it on the DVD with 2 friends wanting to watch a somewhat interesting action / war flick
Why couldn't I just have read the reviews first
<br /><br />Already at the first "bomb" scene the film has huge glitches, and they continue to show and become bigger and bigger
My 2 friends, not connected to the military in any way spotted a couple of the filmmaker's mistakes almost as fast as I myself did and asked me if some of the things going on we're realistic
Well, as you might have guessed, they're not - at all
<br /><br />Avoid this movie unless you're able to overlook these completely idiotic and re-occurring mistakes being made
My friend's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out, so when she brought home The Convent, a horror movie, i couldn't wait to watch it
Given that it's supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious, I can say that in some weird way, I like this movie
<br /><br />yes, the acting is bad, and yes, it's the cheapest movie i've ever seen, but it's so damn funny! "WHAT, ARE YOU SMOKING CA-RACK?!" i didn't know this movie even was ever released
overall the movie is pretty bad (you gotta admit that much at least) but I promise you, you will get a good laugh out of it
<br /><br />*this movie kinda sucks but it's good for a laugh
especially that guy that holds the 'dagger of despair'
**SPOILERS** Redicules slasher film that makes no sense at all with a killer running around dressed in a black robe and wearing what looks like a pull-over Peter Lorre rubber mask
Were told early in the movie, almost the very first scene, that young Beth Morgan was in rehab due to heavy drug use after her boyfriend was murdered in Tennyson Collage about a year ago
<br /><br />It's also brought out that FBI Agent Sacker's (Jeff Conaway), who's obsessed in catching the killer,daughter was also murdered in Tennyson around the same time
By the time the movie "Do You Wanna Know A Secret" is over it's never explained just what those two killings back in Connecticute has to do with the slaughter in Florida of some half dozen collage students a year later? other that the killer, at least in the murder of Beth's boyfriend, wore the same silly Halloween outfit
<br /><br />At spring break in the Sunshine State the six students spend their vacation at a beach house and before you know it they start getting knocked off one at a time
Starting with computer geek Brad Clyton, Chad Allen, the killing even spill over into town with a number of people who have nothing to do with the targeted student including the police chief Gavin, Jack McGee, getting sliced open
<br /><br />The masked killer saves Beth for last in this weird ceremony at a deserted church, in what looks like the Florida Everglades
He then finally reveals who his is and what he intentions are which make as much sense as the movie does, none
Trying to scare it's audience all the movie does is confuse and bewilder it with a number of not-too convincing slasher scenes
The most effective ones having the victim Oz Washington, Tom Jay Jones, survive at least three attempts on his life and ending up, together with Agent Sacker, the hero in the film
<br /><br />Oz also had a vicious cut on is foot from a large splinter of glass that almost cut it in half and crippled him but later he miraculously recovered, after getting arrested for a murder he didn't commit, in fact he had it out two more time with the killer with him not as much as having a slight limp in his walk! It also made no sense at all why Oz and Beth went on their own to tack down and catch the killer instead of calling the police, with a cellphone that Oz had, instead? <br /><br />Beth's boyfriend, who loses his head over her, in the movie Hank Ford, Joseph Lawrence, is also very unconvincing as well as the two girls at the beach house
They together with with Beth Oz end up being the killers victims and then somehow disappearing from sight! for a moment you didn't know if they were really killed at all or if it was some kind of hallucination on Oz's or the local police part
Until the off-the-wall final scene where they popped up in the church
<br /><br />We also get an insight on a previous relationship between Tina and Hank with her, drunk and acting obnoxious, trying to get it on with Hank as Beth walks in without Hank and Tina even noticing her
That seemed to have upset Beth even more then her boyfriend being murdered at the beginning of the movie
The story is a little slow and a little stupid
Greta Garbo doesn't look very good and I couldn't understand half the things she said because of her accent, which was exaggerated for this role
Melvyn Douglas, meanwhile, plays his normal unlikeable role and Constance Bennett is just so-so except for a couple of her screams, which were funny
<br /><br />On the plus side, Roland Young had the best role in the film
I wish he had more lines, as he disappeared in the second half of the story
Also, it was interesting to see Ruth Gordon look so young
I had only seen her in those crazy roles she played from the late '60s to the '80s and a whacked out old woman
Story-wise, the best part might have been the final few minutes when we see a stunt man doing amazing things on skis, pretending to be Douglas falling down the slopes
<br /><br />Overall, I can see where this film - Garbo's last - was not a box-office success
It just drags too much, going on and on about deceptions
At first, three words: READ THE BOOK! Really guys - this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters
I loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film
It was ludicrous, with half a heart and the story bad explained
The novel - in the first place! - wasn't meant to focus on an adventure! That's only the surroundings
In the film, the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat! Additional, the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the elucidation of the events at the end were parsimonious! They screwed it up!
Basically, take the concept of every Asian horror ghost movie and smash it into one and you get this movie
The story goes like this: a bunch of college kids get voice mails from their own phones that are foretelling their deaths
There's some s*** going on with ghosts, which if you've seen any Asian ghost movie, isn't scary by now
This movie was quite upsetting because it's very clichéd
Unfortunately the actors are put into a very Ring-esquire situation, so it's nothing we haven't seen in the past
<br /><br />As far as gore, there's not much going on
We get a cool sequence that includes an arm twisting a head off (I don't know how else to explain that), but it was cut away so you don't see anything except the final result
You see some blood at times, including decapitated arms and a zombie (that looked really cool I might add), but this movie isn't too bloody
<br /><br />The scares in the movie are few and spread out, and it's really not that scary
You'll get some creepy images at times, but it's not enough for me to consider scary
It's nothing different from Ringu, Ju-On, or Dark Water, and none of those scared me either
That's really the downfall of this (and most Asian horror movies) is that if it doesn't deliver the scares then it's just not that good
<br /><br />As far as directing, Takashi Miike still did a pretty good job
He seemed a little tamed in this movie compared to his past movies, but he still portrays a lot of his messed up style he's become famous for
A lot of images were a lot like Miike (including a scene with a bunch of jars of dead fetuses), and the last 15 - 20 minutes seemed far more Miike then the rest of the movie
Still, the movie is flawed by its unoriginality
<br /><br />I would recommend this only to people who are huge on Asian horror movies (even if you are, I can recommend much better) or big Miike fans
Warning to those who want to get into Miike, this is NOT his best work
<br /><br />I'm giving it a 4 because it's just mediocre
Perhaps if this was released 4 or 5 years ago it might be worth a higher rating
<br /><br />Also, I'd like to b**** about Asian horror movies real quick
How come if it's an Asian horror movie it's automatically suppose to be good over here (US)? A LOT of these movies are the equivalent in Japan to what Scream, Urban Legends, and I Know What You Did Last Summer were over here in the 90's
And a lot of these movies rely way too much on scares and imagery that if it doesn't deliver the scares they set out to do then they're just not that good, and nothing would change that
More Asian horror films need to be more like Audition and A Tale of Two Sisters, two movies that if they don't frighten or scare you, at least they have great stories, acting, direction, cinematography, and much more to back them up
Two movies that aren't just great horror movies, but great movies in general
More Asian horror movies need to be like these instead of the cliché, "A ghost just wanted to be found so it went around killing people through their phone/video tape/house/electric appliance/water pipes/google search engine/vibrator/groceries/etc
I'm a big fan of 50s sci-fi, but this is not one of my favorites
While the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teeny bopper sci-fi flick, the director counted too heavily on it to carry the movie
It's clear he was working with no money, because the entire movie is loaded with bloated dialogue that goes on and on forever
I have *never* seen so much time-killing in a movie
<br /><br />There are probably less than 60 seconds of "blob footage" in the entire movie, and most of the rest of it is people engaging in a lot of poorly-written, run-on dialogue
how could casting have thought anyone in their right mind would believe them as teenagers
this is without a doubt the worst most idiotic horrible piece o' crap i have ever watched
<br /><br />this movies plot is that some guy goes crazy and dresses up as santa claus and kills people BECAUSE he saw his mother give his father oral sex while he was dressed as santa clause
THAT IS WHY HE WENT INSANE? is it just me or is that the worst damn reason for someone to go insane like EVER? and that's not the only thing
i'm being serious when I say NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS DAMN MOVIE
nothing until like 1 hour and 15 minutes of it have gone by
<br /><br />there's an entire friggin scene where he glues a friggin santa beard on to him
WHO THE HELL WANTS TO SEE THAT? however i must say the ending of this movie made me crap myself laughing at it
so if you see this movie on TV or something come back in like 1 hour and 20 minutes just to watch without a doubt the worst ending in all of cinematic history
<br /><br />it's not even so good its bad, it's tedious, it's idiotic, it made me want to break the vcr
it's just not worth your time also i'm sure every other review mentioned this but The actress who played the mother on Home Improvement was in this movie for a split second
YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW BAD THIS MOVIE IS? I'D RATHER WATCH HOME IMPROVEMENT FOR SIXTY SIX HOURS THEN EVEN LOOK AT THIS MOVIES COVER EVER AGAIN
SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I watched half of this movie and I didn't like it
Barely anything happens, the women sit around and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope, they smoke weed, read magazines, care for their sick friend, and cut up the occasional dead body
BORING!!!!<br /><br />Second reason: There are too many things left unexplained
Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men, restrains them in a chair and interrogates them
Who are these men? How do they know anything about illegal activity concerning the diseased flesh eaters? Why does he kill one and let another one go?<br /><br />Also there is this dude who at first I thought also had the flesh eating disease but he puts his fist through a wall with superhuman strength suggesting he's not quite what we originally thought-never explained! How frustrating is that? <br /><br />Conclusion: I found the women annoying, the story uninteresting, the duologue tedious, and the action non-existent
Also the cover art is misleading since it makes you believe this movie is going to be cool when it clearly isn't
I rented this movie based on some of the reviews made by other people on this website, and although I respect the fact that some people might have enjoyed this flick, I will from now on make sure I read more than two reviews deep into a movie so as to avoid renting another movie I regret seeing
"The Brain Machine" will at least put your own brain into overdrive trying to figure out what it's all about
Four subjects of varying backgrounds and intelligence level have been selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and environment
Since the only common denominator among them is the fact that they each have no known family should have been a tip off - none of them will be missed
<br /><br />The whole affair is supervised by a mysterious creep known only as The General, but it seems he's taking his direction from a Senator who wishes to remain anonymous
There's also a shadowy guard that the camera constantly zooms in on, who later claims he doesn't take his direction from the General or 'The Project'
Too bad he wasn't more effective, he was overpowered rather easily before the whole thing went kablooey
<br /><br />If nothing else, the film is a veritable treasure trove of 1970's technology featuring repeated shots of dial phones, room size computers and a teletype machine that won't quit
Perhaps that was the basis of the film's alternate title - "Time Warp"; nothing else would make any sense
As for myself, I'd like to consider a title suggested by the murdered Dr
Krisner's experiment titled 'Group Stress Project'
It applies to the film's actors and viewers alike
<br /><br />Keep an eye out just above The General's head at poolside when he asks an agent for his weapon, a boom mic is visible above his head for a number of seconds
<br /><br />You may want to catch this flick if you're a die hard Gerald McRaney fan, could he have ever been that young? James Best also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptic reverend, but don't call him Father
For something a little more up his alley, try to get your hands on 1959's "The Killer Shrews"
That one at least doesn't pretend to take itself so seriously
The power rangers is definitely the worst television show and completely ridiculous plastic toy line in the history of the United States
<br /><br />There is absolutely nothing even remotely entertaining about this completely awful television show
<br /><br />This is simply the worst show ever made, with awful actors, dressing up in multi colored spandex outfits that look completely ridiculous
<br /><br />The owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves, since there is no redeeming value to this nonsense
<br /><br />Kids of today should try watching better shows like the Toy Story movies instead of this garbage
What in God's name happened here? How does one go about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of Redneck Zombies? Was Zombie '90 ever supposed to entertain someone
anyone, or even make a dollars profit? But mainly, what happened here? <br /><br />Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence was directed by a lunatic by the name of Andreas Schnaas, who specializes in earth-shattering gore films, such as Goblet of Gore, and Anthropophagus 2000, and some of which contain profanity in the titles
In the gore department, this one isn't much different than the rest
<br /><br />Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence is as bad as Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive is gory, think about it
<br /><br />Getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time
An accident, involving chemicals causes the dead to come back, and eat the living
Never has the concept been treated in such a manner
I can't tell whether, or not this was originally meant to be funny, somehow, I doubt the English dubbing was being very true to the original script, but stranger things have happened
The whole thing just reminds me of a shot-on-video introduction to a Troma movie, except it lasts a hell of a lot longer
<br /><br />I've seen only one film that was worse than this, The Chooper
<br /><br />For proof that Andreas Schnaas is an actual director, I would highly recommend Nikos The Impaler If you think you have no standards in what you look for in a bad movie, give Extreme Pestilence a try, but you've been warned
It takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through
But if gore is all you're here for, then you might be able to stomach this one
Other than that, no atmosphere, no, and I mean NO budget, no entertainment value, but mostly, no pride
1/10 <br /><br />Updated 7/5/09: After a few more viewings of Zombie '90, I've had a change of heart, or I guess I just get it now
Zombie '90 is hilarious, so nevermind the harsh words, Although, Extreme Pestilence still only deserves one star
If this movie should be renamed, it should be "The Jackasses of Hazzard
" To sum it up, this movie is nothing but 88 minutes of two immature country punks joyriding the famed 1968 Dodge Charger around town and in the country, chasing the girls and eluding the law
<br /><br />I have been a fan of the "Dukes" and what tarnishes the movie is the characters are out of key
The overindulgence of profanity, sexual references, and drug use, has made the good name of the "Dukes" into trailer trash
<br /><br />Side from comparing it to the television show, the acting was horrible
The only actor that got it right was the famed 1969 Dodge Charger named General Lee
The others have exaggerated the character's role which tarnished the movie
<br /><br />The "Dukes" have been another casualty of the 21-st century Hollywood television-to-big screen transition tragedy
Skip this movie and just buy the television series on DVD
Years after the fall of the last of the great corporations, the world has fallen into a new dark age where cyborgs are harvested for their parts
Cash, a female cyborg, travels to a wasteland doctor to receive news that she is pregnant
On the run from Recyclers (bounty hunters who hunt cyborgs), Cash tries to find her way to Cytown, the mythical refuge for cyborgs
<br /><br />"Cyborg 3: The Recycler" is the third (& last so far) entry in the CYBORG trilogy
The first film was originally planned to be a sequel to MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, but was quickly rewritten into a standard post-apocalyptic martial-arts fest that became something of a cult classic due to its cheesy action scenes
CYBORG 2: GLASS SHADOW was a sequel that actually improved upon its predecessor but was not widely seen (& was dismissed by those few who saw it as cheap fodder)
<br /><br />This film, for one thing, tries to be a meld of the first two films (the first was a cheesy action film while the second was a smart Cyberpunk story) but unfortunately falls short on both counts
The budget was obviously lower than CYBORG 2, with the film being set in the desert wastelands (like so many post-apocalyptic action films of the 90s were), shot around old industrial buildings to conserve costs
<br /><br />The film's story centres on a plot device, that of a pregnant cyborg, that is as interesting as it is absurd (this film is not the first to try that idea; the anime OVA series ARMITAGE III uses it to a greater extent)
But the film falls into the same trap that so many low-budget sci-fi action films fall victim to, in the fact that the snags (synthetic organisms) featured are nothing more than androids
The visual effects amount to nothing more than prosthetic arms & makeup effects
<br /><br />The acting is pretty standard for this kind of film, with the lead actress (Khrystyne Haje) being the single worst performer on display
Instead of being joyed at the news she is pregnant, she acts all whiny & sullen
Her co-stars are much better, Malcolm McDowell being the usual gangster type who enlivens the scenes he appears in & Richard Lynch has a lot of fun as the chief villain
Of particular note is Andrew Byniarski, playing Lynch's right hand man, who would later appear in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake & its prequel
Ok, I wrote a scathing review b/c the movie is awful
As I was waiting another review (for Derrida) of mine to pop up, i decided to check out old reviews of this awful movie
They ALL, I say ALL, come from contributors have have not rated any other movie other than this one
Crimminy! and wait till you to the "rosebud" [sic] review
<br /><br />Checkout the other movies rosebud reviewed and had glowing recommendations for
Oh, shoot!, they happen to be for the only other movies by the two writers and director
<br /><br />Joe, Tony, you suck as writers, and tony, you couldn't direct out of a bad script
No jobs for you!<br /><br />ALWAYS CHECK POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR A LOW RATED MOVIE
You know you're in trouble when the opening narration basically tells you who survives
Unnecessary, "Matrix"-influenced bullet-time camera work
Ravers who become skilled combatants in the blink of an eye
<br /><br />I was hoping for at least a "so bad it's good" zombie movie, but this one is "so bad those involved with its creation should be barred from ever making a movie again"
but there were choreographed songs and dancing in it
no the acting was not good enough for that
<br /><br />Is Whoopi Goldberg a quality serious Actor
<br /><br />I had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie
The message on apartheid and the "tribute" to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted
But as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worse
<br /><br />See for yourself, but in fairness I hated i
While that could summarize 99% of the SciFi channel's movies, it really applies here
I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed, and I like action movies, and I like all of the main actors, so this could have been great
However, despite some good acting, this movie fails due to Bill Platt's bad writing and directing
<br /><br />Another review made the good point of needing to know where you're going so you can get there
It's put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words "second draft" are not in Bill Platt's vocabulary
There is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing
This scene even begins and ends with them driving a car, so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle
<br /><br />This movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others, some to the point where you can guess the entire "plot" up front
It also had a habit of aborting a fight early, probably just because they couldn't afford it
There are also a few laughably bad scenes where the "plot" is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed "toxic adhesive" (seriously, what *is* that?)
<br /><br />If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because she's OK
She does manage to break out of her "Roswell" persona a few times and make for a good tough chick (but not always)
John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he's ever done since playing Q back in ST:TNG, so that's nothing new
<br /><br />In all, I gave this movie a 4/10 rating
This bomb is just one 'explosion' after another, with no humor and only absurd situations
I would have made it a zero but that option wasn't permitted
Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles
But then at times we all need to have money
And I still recoil at that Tim Burton farce about Mars
Nicholson was brave enough to admit that was a turkey
But if that was a turkey, this movie then is not even a gizzard
I wish I could say, "give me back my money"
But that is the trouble with premium services, the subscription variety
The only reason I even gave it a 1 out of 10 is because the option to give it zero out of 10 was not allowed
This was the biggest waste of time I've ever endured
For roughly 75 minutes, you are subjected to the WORST acting (and I don't mean that in a good way either, like as in KILLER NERD which had great horrible acting) and a plot that is not only ridiculous but also has absolutely NOTHING to do with a massacre
The reason I even rented this piece of crap was because it has massacre in the title
That said, there was only one killing in the entire movie and it was pretty lame at that
You spend more time watching the kids bickering and doing yard work than anything
Speaking of the kids, the little boy actor is probably the most irritating child actor since bob from house by the cemetery
Did I mention it was shot on video as well? If you want to throw away money and over an hour of your life, then by all means watch it
But if you savor your hard earned dollars and time, then stray as far away as possible
Spinal Tap was funny because if you knew a little about heavy metal, you saw in-jokes all over the place
If you know anything about porn, this mock documentary will leave you cold
<br /><br />Spinal Tap was funny because it took a familiar world and pushed it over the top
This film is decidedly not funny because it paints a picture of how porn is made that bears no relationship to the real world
<br /><br />The acting here is uniformly awful, but that would not matter much if the core idea of the movie were good
Certainly one of the dozen or so worst movies ever released in any form, featuring a bizarrely abominable performance by Rain Joan of Arc Phoenix (River's sister, inevitably), as Bonanza Jellybean plus inconceivably awful voiceover narration by Tom Robbins, the author of the novel, which had/retains its peculiar sweet/loopy charms
Few films have left me with such a feeling of unease, and this is not a compliment
Since I saw it in a theater (How it ended there I can only wonder) I was subjected to 90 mn of hateful, derivative garbage, the main impression being a bit like this other sick-o movie "Don't answer the phone" - but worse
The nastiness of it all, rape and all, is shown without any distance (unlike strong stuff like "Last house on the left") and utter contempt for the (perfect ?) victims and everybody involved, leaving the viewer to be treated as a sadistic voyeur
I can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is
I was sold on the promise of action, with Segal and stealth aircraft, which normally make for an entertaining action movie
I can honestly say I'd rather gouge my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again
The acting was so awful that it was almost funny
The story was insanely weak, with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an F117 through them
The script was so poor, if I found out that a 10 year old wrote it I shouldn't be in the least surprised
The direction and production is so amateur, I wouldn't even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video
Those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art, and they should be ashamed of themselves
Steven Segal should never ever show his face in public again, I can't imagine what made him agree to star in this, the worst film I have seen in my entire life
I am really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones started out making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons I've ever seen
I did not laugh once throughout this short, and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, not boring! Alas, this short turns out to be Good Night Elmer (another incredibly boring Jones short) with the addition of Bugs Bunny
<br /><br />The first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no gag payoff
Good Night Elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff
This cartoon, on the other hand, is afflicted with the second warning sign of a dull cartoon: there's too much dialogue
The cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve, but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue
At one point, Elmer finishes eating dinner, and comments, "That was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb," possibly the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters reading text out loud in the later-era Woody Woodpecker cartoons doesn't count in my book)
Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 20 thanks to redundant dialogue like this
<br /><br />Elmer's Pet Rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me, but if you've sold your soul to Chuck Jones and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career, you might enjoy it
supposedly based on the life of Domino Harvey a model turned bounty hunter
I always keep an open mind when it comes to movies, however, this movie lost its chances when it became apparent it had narration throughout the film, something i can't stand, and to top it off, the heroine of the story is so hateful and depicted as an arrogant b!ch I just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head
it's too incoherent, too flashy and way too boring, it's a who gives a crap kinda story, and i really think that big time directors need to make movies based on their own or a writer's own imagination not something based on some ignorant snobby brat's life
Chesty gringo Telly Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is a US-Mexico "Border Cop"
He serves as a father figure to young immigrant Danny De La Paz (as Benny Romero), who wants Mr
Savalas to be best man at his impending wedding
Savalas is tough, but boss Eddie Albert (as Commander Moffat) may be tougher
Tough is what you need to stop smuggler Michael V
<br /><br />If you find the possibility of hearing "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas" uttering expletives to be repulsive, you ought to steer clear of "The Border"
If not, you may not have the stomach for the "realistic" cow slaughtering scene
Although it doesn't end up being worth much, Mr
De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (as Leina) steal the show
<br /><br />** The Border (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Alber
This incredibly overrated anime television series (26 episodes, 25 minutes each) is about a 14-year-old boy (and two of his girl classmates) who pilots a giant robot to defend Japan against invading beings called Angels
There is very little explanation given to the Angels or why their numbers have increased in recent times, and they just seem to pop out of nowhere for no apparent reason (why not attack all at once instead of at spaced out intervals that are convenient for the humans you're attempting to destroy?)
The robot fight scenes attempt to employ a variety of obstacles, but the action itself is poorly executed and boring to watch
Almost every episode seems like a waste of space where nothing of interest occurs
<br /><br />Some might be intrigued by fans who mention the (very few) symbolic references herein, but that's all they are - shallow one-liners to religious or philosophical concepts that are randomly tossed in with zero craftsmanship
As a whole the series is incredibly tedious due to the superficiality of the characters, who are really nothing more than self-pitying crybabies
The psychology is pathetic, with hopelessly simplistic conflicts like "I hate my father" repeated over and over and over and over again with no progression beyond their face value
It's no understatement to say that these characters plunge this series from time-wasting mediocrity to anger-inducing garbage during the final episodes with their endless, angst-ridden diatribes of excessively repetitive psychobabble (some of which is totally meaningless)
<br /><br />I'm not kidding when I say that this series just got worse and worse as it progressed
Every day I'd look at the DVD set sitting on my living room table and say to myself, "Damn, I've gotta watch the next episode at some point
(sigh) I may as well slug through another one tonight
" The real kicker was that the episodes were only 25 minutes long, yet they were somehow able to digress into a completely uninteresting borefest within the opening 10 minutes
This is coming from a guy who will happily sit through 150-minute films with glacial pacing, so my criticism of this series is most damning indeed
<br /><br />Never in my entire life have I despised watching a series as much as "Evangelion
" I had already purchased it based off of all the fanatical comments on IMDb, and I certainly wasn't going to let it collect dust after spending my hard-earned money
What followed was 10 hours of pure, unmitigated torture
My love/hate relationship with anime is turning into a hate/love relationship after this highly acclaimed disaster
<br /><br />"Evangelion" represents everything anime should NOT be - massive quantities of dull, pretentious tripe under the guise of intelligent cinema
The universal acclaim for this piece of crap is simply unbelievable; and the ridiculous assertions by fans that this series as "one of mankind's greatest achievements" is probably the most stupifying comment I've ever heard on IMDb - and I've seen some doozies
My comments on this movie have been deleted twice, which i find pretty offending, since i am making an effort to judge this movie for other people
Please be tolerant of other people's opinion
Obviously writing in the spirit of Nietzsches works is not understood, so ill change my comment completely
<br /><br />I think this is a really bad movie for several reasons
<br /><br />Subject: one should be very careful in making a movie about a philosopher that is even today not understood by the masses and amongst peers brings out passionate discussions
One thing philosophers do agree on is that Nietzsche was a great thinker
So making a movie about his life, which obviously includes his 'ideas' is a thing one should be extremely careful with, or preferably, don't do at all
Wisdom starts with knowing what you don't know
One might think this is not a review of the movie itself, but the movie is not about an imaginary character, it is about the life of someone who actually lived and had/has great influence on the world of yesterday, today and tomorrow
If someone tells a story about a tomato, i can express my thoughts about the story itself, but also about the chosen subject, the tomato
There is a responsibility for producers when they make a movie about actual facts
Specially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken
<br /><br />Screenplay: One of the first things i noticed were the ridiculous accents
Why? It distracts from what it should be about; Nietzsche and the truths he found
It doesn't help putting things in a right geographical perspective or time! Come on, make it proper English or better yet; German! Even Mel Gibson got that part right
letting his characters speak some gibberish Aramaic in the Passion
<br /><br />Secondly, it is well over-acted
<br /><br />3d, Assante is not an actor to depict Nietzsche
I watched the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 lbs and House, M
Tucci's character is brilliant but socially inept out of choice, similar to Laurie's character House, but without the acerbic wit that Laurie brings to House
Meanwhile, Tucci's 'straight guy', the emphatic doctor Seger, is not developed into a more interesting character, like the fallible 'straight guys' Cuddy and Wilson
Indira Varma's character Adrienne Holland is too similar to Jennifer Morrison's doctor Cameron to be a co-incidence
<br /><br />Someone at CBS obviously noticed the success of House, M
and told his staff to get him (her) a similar show, hoping that mimicry would prove successful
However, copying a show like House demands the same high level balance of wit and suspense and Tucci and company are just not up to the challenge
<br /><br />I didn't know the show was canceled until I read the comments on IMDb, but it doesn't come as a surprise to me
Its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film, because there is almost no development in the plot
Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry
The acting seems very poor as well, and reminds me of the old black and white Maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime Chinese television
Although this is difficult to tell with the female role, Yuwen, as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin
It reminds me of fading star Gong Li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the West for having a scowl on her face all the time
<br /><br />Tian Zhuangzhuang's film the 'Blue Kite' was a far better film
But don't be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a Small Town was set in the late '40s
Unlike the Blue Kite, the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself, the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop
<br /><br />I wonder whether Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeal to a foreign audience who can't tell the difference between a film that is 'beautiful' 'profound' or 'hypnotic' and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial
<br /><br />If any film fits the description of 'overrated,' this is it
I see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry
Stupid, mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes (piloted by Burgess Meredith) chasing a Porsche race car which runs on decades-old gasoline sludge, driven by Lee Majors, with Chris Makepeace as the runaway techno-wiz who can McGyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously, and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society
Terrible waste of Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film
Groundhog Day meets a Christian Coalition horror film
<br /><br />Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis) is stalked and possibly killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry who is quite menacing and brutal)
I say possibly because she wakes up and it was all a dream
Or was it? (Cue music)<br /><br />The basic problem with the film is that these fifteen minutes of plot (Done quite well the first time) is repeated over and over again
And since Claire wakes up every time and every scene is clearly a dream or alternate reality I just stopped caring what happened to Claire and started wondering what lame twist at the end was going to pull this together
<br /><br />I was rooting for a séance (which honestly would have made more sense) but instead got one of those too obvious by half surprise endings (Think the Village or Below) Yup the film collapses faster than Donnie Darko's directors cut
All the great twist endings in horror movies The Sixth Sense, the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Happy Birthday to Me worked because the audience wasn't expecting a left field explanation
(Heck even the canoe ending in the original Friday the 13th was worth a jolt)<br /><br />Salvage on the other hand screams twist ending with every scene change
Other nagging faults is the one note piano soundtrack (Though the featured songs were decent) the obvious time padding (Claire doing the dishes, Claire's mother's subplots), the way Claire says "hello is anyone there" every time she thinks there is a serial killer around
<br /><br />Also some of the secondary acting roles (In particular Claire's mother played by Maureen Olander who resembles a Mary Kay zombie) shows the first time actor low budget roots
<br /><br />Both too clever by half and not nearly clever enough Salvage keeps your interest if only to see how they are going to fix this mess
Bill Maher's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion
Apart from ridiculing a bunch of Rabbis inventing warped machines to get around Sabbath regulations, he really doesn't attack Judaism and seems enraged when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel
If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so called 'holy books' of organized religion
This is evidence of his complete and utter lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film
<br /><br />I find it really hard to believe that the man is atheist or even all that intelligent
Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but what do you have to offer them in return? Nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they're stupid
What makes him the "rational" person in the room? In a way it reflects how he really isn't and in the process ends up looking just as stupid as those people
<br /><br />If you want to watch a good movie/documentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization, watch Richard Dawkins' 'Root of All Evil?'
It is a brilliantly researched documentary, clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how
<br /><br />Bill Maher's Religulous is not funny, poses no interesting questions nor does it provide any insight on so controversial a topic
It seems to be the rantings and ravings of an old man disgruntled with his Catholic upbringing
There's nothing worse than renting an Asian movie and getting an American movie experience instead
<br /><br />It's only my opinion, but a good thriller is dependent upon the establishment of likable, intelligent characters
As far as likability is concerned, the protagonists in Say Yes are a quaint married couple
Unfortunately, they are stupid beyond belief
Let us count the ways they mishandle being terrorized by a stalker
After a hitchhiker threatens to kill you, be sure to tell him what hotel you're staying at when you drop him off
Beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses, thereby allowing him to press charges of assault
Don't bother telling the police about the stalker and simply assume (for no apparently good reason) that the cops were bribed by him
While trying to escape, let your lady out of your sight as much as possible to ensure that the stalker kidnaps her
After getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife, be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face him one-on-one
No point in being unfair, right? <br /><br />Now, I'd never expect that any person would be immune to making a few mistakes under these stressful conditions, but the characters in Say Yes are so dense and make so many unbelievable mistakes that it's effectively impossible for the viewer to care about their safety, since they are victims of their own doing
This kills the enjoyability of the entire film
<br /><br />In case you were wondering, the scriptwriters didn't stop with dim-witted characters
Since they themselves are surely dim-witted for writing this crapfest, they decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out the window
The stalker kills a cop inside a police station  while the protagonist is asleep no more than ten feet away
The stalker engages in all sorts of dubious activities in broad daylight and around tons of people, yet no one other than the married couple seems to notice his odd behavior
The stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being
The "suspense" scenes had no imagination whatsoever
In fact, some scenes were direct rip-offs from American movies
<br /><br />The only positive is the decapitation near the end, which was a pretty brutal scene since it was inflicted upon the wife
It's too bad the filmmakers followed it up with an outrageously stupid ending that comes out of left field
<br /><br />Truly, the Koreans behind the making of Say Yes should be ashamed of themselves
Better yet, they should just move to California and take employment with people who make movies with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence
We have a killer stop-motion dinosaur with flippers
Okay, so let's call this movie THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER
What else can we add? Hmm, two idiots called Arnie & Mitch to define the ultimate definition of "comic relief"
We also got to have a sheriff who doesn't really do a damn thing in this film and whom nobody listens to
Aw crap, we're over halfway through the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy! No worries, let's introduce some guy with a moustache, have him rob a store to indicate he's a bad guy, then have him pop up somewhere near the lake, have him chased through the woods and all this for the sole purpose of him ending up as dinosaur snack food
<br /><br />A complete, clumsy mess, this film
Its logic will twist your mind to force laughter out of you
The first film to feature Dave Allen as a "stop motion supervisor"
After this one, he joined forces with Charles Band for several years until the the mid-nineties, when Band ran out of money to pay him, I guess
The dinosaur effects are charming and the whole film is pretty damn unintentionally funny
Unfortunately, that's about the only good thing that can be said for it
The mind-bending logic in the narrative should be enough reason to put it on the list
The story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no-brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring
Some of the audience seemed to find it funny but I like more intelligent humor
<br /><br />There were several known Swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script
<br /><br />I don't remember the original movie so I can't say if it's better or worse
<br /><br />If you enjoy movies like Sällskapsresan this movie might be worth taking a look at
The title of this obscure and (almost righteously) forgotten 80's slasher inevitably reminds me of The Cure's mega-smash-monster hit song with the same title, hence a piece of the lyrics in the title-section of this user comment
Also, I didn't have anything else to say that was useful, anyway
But hey, "The Forest" isn't totally hopeless and not even *that* bad, actually
If nothing else, at least it obeys the, admittedly unwritten, first rule of 80's slasher: kill someone within the first 10 minutes of playtime
Sure you've heard about the basic premise of this film a dozen times before, but don't let that discourage you from watching it, as "The Forest" has a couple of things more to offer than just an appealingly sinister cover image
It's actually a bit of an atypical 80's slasher! The main characters aren't ordinary brainless teenagers and the script has solid ambitions towards supernaturalism
The concept isn't always successful, let alone plausible, but it's more than interesting enough to hold your attention and there are even are a couple of surprisingly strong moments of tension and plot twists to enjoy
Two married couples decide to go camping in the most isolated woods of California, but due to a stupid bet the wives travel separately from their husbands
Barely set up for the night, they receive uncanny visits from a mother looking for her two children, the children themselves and finally the father who's out hunting for human flesh
The demented family may be real or imaginary, but the women are definitely in danger and by the time their husbands arrive, they have already vanished
The men too encounter the family, and they find out more about the slightly dysfunction background
"The Forest" is a weird and unusual film, to say the least
It's not exactly a masterpiece of plotting, but the thoroughly strange atmosphere will certainly appeal to open-minded fans of 80's horror
The murders are fairly gruesome and will-filmed, including a slit throat and a painful saw-massacre, and the filming locations are stunningly beautiful
The more you contemplate about the story and its abrupt twists, the less it makes any sense, so my advice would just be to enjoy this odd viewing experience for as long as it lasts and not a minute longer
The acting performances are just above average, the music is okay and at least director Donald Jones (also responsible for the 70's exploitation-sickie "Schoolgirls in Chains") tried to be a little more creative that the majority of 80's horror films
First off let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies
Nothing, and I mean nothing in this movie is even remotely thrilling
Most of it is very confusing and as it progresses you just wish it would end!! Some people want a movie that makes them "think" through the entire thing, to which I say
"More power to you"!! I on the other hand just want to be entertained
Which brings me back to this stinker, entertainment it is not
This movie is stupid and a complete waste of time
Most of this didn't make any sense, and by the time you think you have one scene figured out another lame scene comes around and
Charles Bronson continued his 80's slump with what could possibly be his worst movie of the decade, if not ever
In it he plays a detective who goes to great lengths to track down a pimp who has abducted an Asian girl and is currently selling her to the highest bidder
It's a shameful attempt at action and is quite possibly the most depressing movie ever made
A lot of people consider the Death Wish sequels to be Bronson's worst movies
The Death Wish sequels weren't great movies but were in most cases competently made and very watchable
Kinjite however is an utterly dull thriller which is punctuated by mean spirited racism and child molestation
It really is a rephrensible film and all of it is made worse by the fact that it tries to preach a "Law and Justice" mentality that is too overwrought to really say anything
Indeed the movie begins with underage sex being interrupted with Bronson then anally raping the pedophile with a dildo
The Chicago theater I watched this in just gasped at the awkwardness of this scene, only to gasp at the awkwardness of the pimp raping the girl in this film
It has no point other than to exploit and really the movie wasn't well written enough to rise above the exploitation level and deliver something that would work
Bronson seems more into things but clearly this is far too repugnant to save
I want to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the coolest actor ever but this effort is ultimately his worst
Wouldn't it be great if Not Another Teen Movie actually put an end to all of these stupid, pointless, I'm getting more sex than you are teen movies? In a perfect world, yes
This one is not humiliating for the stars, it's humiliating for the distributor
All of the jokes are basically college students exposing stuff that people probably have NO interest in seeing, yet it's "funny
" Devon Sawa, who was actually good in Final Destination, is just plain dull in this movie
It makes you wonder if it's being bad on purpose
Nominated for the oscar "worst script ever" in my opinion
There's no decent story, rediculous acting, VERY lousy humor
By every means possible, if you have little self respect please don't waste your time seeing this movie
Although u can see the actors CAN act, it leaves you dumber after watching it
Precious braincells are being killed watching this crap
<br /><br />i warned u<br /><br />DON'T SEE THIS MOVI
The only reason I DVRd this movie was because 1
I live in Cleveland and Shaq plays basketball for us now and 2
The worst parts were, well, just about everything else
My 12 year old son and I just squirmed and couldn't look at the screen when Shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why Max didn't wish for Kazzam to fix that front tooth of his! But for all it's terribleness we just couldn't stop watching it, the story sucked you in, like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit, it was hypnotic
But it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched "Kazzam"
My husband and I were intrigued by the spectacle - a strong willed Southern lady with a messy personal life solves crimes for the LAPD
Unfortunately, the stories of her personal life in the second season became so tedious and unworthy of the strong character that we stopped watching
<br /><br />My husband and I were troubled by the episode where she tries to hide from her mother the fact that she is shacked up
But the deal breaker was the episode where she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend but tells her boss
Why would a strong, middle aged woman do those things? The answer is she wouldn't
Additionally, my husband and I pick out the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy
It is almost always a white male or female introduced in cameo at the murder scene or in an idealized family
Can't the script writers do something original from time to time? As I mentioned, we are no longer viewers
We prefer shows that don't betray the characters and insult our intelligence
<br /><br />I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel
For some reason this movie kept me interested
It was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the movie
In the first movie, he had a "reason" to kill people, but in this sequal, half of the killings/attempted killings were basicly for no reason
Stanley killed the director due to creative differences, he captured the co-writer due to creative differences, but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast? No cast, no movie
He wanted it to "look real when they died"? If this was supposed to be such a high budget movie, use the special effects, MAN
Of course like the first one, the captured girl gets away, and Stanley ends up getting messed up, and dissapears
Only because I like Judd Nelson, and he's the only good part about this sequal
A half-hearted attempt to bring Elvis Presley into the modern day, but despite a sexy little shower scene and a pseudo-Playboy magazine subplot, Presley is surrounded by the same old coy, winking clichés
up on the beach and then proceeds to take over his life--and he doesn't seem to care! Dick Sargent is grueling in another sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) try hard as Elvis' two bosses (he's moonlighting, you see)
Some of the songs are quite good, especially "Almost in Love", but if you want to see a looser, hipper, updated Elvis sex-comedy--look elsewhere
When Elvis and his Fatal Attraction get into bed together, there's actually a wooden board in between them! Get real
Alright, friends, a serious movie buff is expected to watch all kinds of movie, the bad as well as the good, and this movie put me to the test
The always wonderful Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this movie better
Indeed I asked myself why did I even bother to see this rotten trashy movie? Why did I waste my time and money on something that I suspected would be bad? The answer is, of course, that I am a movie buff and therefore cannot avoid what otherwise should be avoided
I will not waste your time explaining what exactly was wrong with this amateurish movie, except to say that the quality of the acting was, to put it politely, subpaar
A serious movie buff may want to take on the responsibility of watching this movie
stay home, don't waste your time, read a book, take take of chores or have yourself a good sandwich
It has humor that 5 year olds that will not even giggle at
I mean, sure, some parts were amusing, but most of it is not
Lindsey Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer,) and she should be working on better movies
The movie should have been aired as a Disney Channel original movie, that is FREE
<br /><br />The only thing that was well done about this movie was the music
Nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to brighten up your day
Especially Alyson and Amanda's Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter's, Beach Boy song, Fun Fun Fun
If I gave it a ten, 9 of that would be the music and 1 will be the movie
Not worth your money, but the soundtrack is
Terrible acting, lame plot, stupid story and just all around terrible movie sums up this piece of junk
The movie theaters should feel bad about actually putting this movie out there for people to watch
This "horror" film was not even in the least bit scary, creepy or disturbing
The acting was so terrible by all of the actors that any attempt to draw you into the movie through dialog are completely destroyed within moments of the actor/actress opening their mouth
Plus the entire story, i don't know why someone would make a movie with this story AGAIN
Even if it's a free ticket don't waste one moment viewing this movie
It was one of those "I have to watch this because it's so horribly bad" moments, like Roadhouse without the joy
The writing is atrocious; completely inane and the acting is throw-up-in-your-mouth bad
<br /><br />There's low budget and then there is the abyss which is where this epic should be tossed and never seen from again
I mean, the main characters go to a ski retreat in some rented house and the house is, well, ordinary which is no big deal, but they choose to show all the houseguests pouring over it like it was the Sistine Chapel
I'm sorry but watching 6 guys stare into every 10'x10' boring room with a futon in it and gushing is lame
I guess they didn't learn anything from the Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (see hotel room check scene)
wow a toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! I don't buy the its all over the top so anything goes routine
<br /><br />edit: Apparently other more close minded reviewers believe that since I disliked this movie, I am an "obvious hater" which I can only assume means I am phobic, which of course is not true
I decided to do this wacky, crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the film and not by its mere presence (i
)<br /><br />Sure, it may be refreshing to see but that doesn't equate into a great movie, just give them some better material to work with and tighter direction
Frankly, I'd rather go listen to my Kitchens of Distinction catalogue than watch this again
the acting itself wasn't even that bad, since it did't come to mind in the movie but whatever had this director in mind? the intended climb towards some climax completely missed the mark,
<br /><br />almost all scenes involve acting that stand so far from our own intentions and way of reacting on things that you don't really attach to any actor in the movie,
In this case, see through cheap method of boasting your way into potential metaphorical brilliance,
<br /><br />I guess I'm bitching but shit,
Anyone not aware of the 1973 original British Lion movie ' The Wicker Man' would,no doubt, have left the cinema with the impression 'Poor' and 'Peurile'
<br /><br />As a devotee of the original I left with the impression Purely Poor
<br /><br />From the grim reality of haggle toothed inbreds drawing the force of law and order into a web of paganistic barbaric ritual on a remote Scottish island, named Summerisle(the original) to a near Amazon-ic colony off the Maine coast of the US, named Summersisle, the remake hardly hits the spot
<br /><br />This is, quite sadly, a case of what 'could' have been a classic remake of a classic being tampered with to cater for a simple minded public
<br /><br />Gentlemen (or given the reworked context of the film) Ladies involved
Following the release of Cube 2: Hypercube (2003), and playing off the alleged success of the original Cube (1998), Director Ernie Barbarash takes the liberty of bringing us the third installment in the trilogy, the prequel Cube Zero
<br /><br />Deep in the bowels of a giant and faceless institution, time and place unknown, two low-ranking operators, Wynn (Zachary Bennett) and Dodd (David Huband) sit and observe on monitors the behavior of people that have been placed in a giant network of cubic chambers, some of which are rigged with death traps
Told that the people they are observing are convicted felons who chose this horrific and deadly ordeal over a lethal injection, these observers have had no problem with their jobs until Wynn, a mathematical genius, discovers that one of the prisoners, a woman named Cassandra (Stephanie Moore) never agreed to be put inside the Cube
Suddenly it's realized that perhaps their "jobs" are not what they seem, and that they may be part of something deeply sick and twisted
<br /><br />For people that have seen and enjoyed the original Cube, this prequel will probably not be to your liking
It's not that the story does not have potential; it's simply that the first Cube film never needed to be expanded on
Standing alone, it is a neat little psychological thriller with very interesting concepts and a certainty about its own message
The problem with Cube Zero is that it destroys some of the mystique of the original, attempting to answer questions with more questions but only really resulting in making a mess of what never needed fixing
<br /><br />What this new film has to offer, which is questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and the banality of evil, certainly are good questions to be raised, but probably should have been done so on their own merits, rather than as a continuation of a film that had no such aspirations
<br /><br />Having said this, the other traits of the film, such as acting and direction and writing, are not awful
There is a bleak, dark look to the film akin to such film noir as 'The Matrix' and 'Dark City', and they have certainly managed to recapture the claustrophobic feeling of the first Cube
Unfortunately for Barbarash, these are not enough positive qualities to save it
This is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative
It lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection
<br /><br />The animation is well done but I feel like it is too presentational
I would have preferred more images from behind, more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to me
<br /><br />But for a Hollywood style film it works OK but it is very derivative of Aardman films and this is bothering to me
Perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voice-over
<br /><br />I think the voice over is too glib
Why is this film so bad? Well, if being so stupidly annoying and unfunny is a reason, then this film is it
The character of Corky Romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst
The gags are predictable but that isn't what makes it bad
They are the lame sort of predictable jokes that your unfunny friend would say
<br /><br />Corky Romano is about a mild mannered vet that tries to do right but is so clumsy
His quiet life is thrown for a loop when the family that once spurned him now needs him to infiltrate the FBI to destroy any trace of the family's crime history
However, it isn't that easy for Corky because the FBI believes him to be a super agent and pegs him with the duty of spying on his very own family
Mishaps and mayhem ensue but it really doesn't feel like any comic hijixn are there
Corky ends up in love with his beautiful FBI partner and has to set the record straight with both the FBI and his family if he is to settle down to the quiet life again
<br /><br />I think what makes this film irritating is both the lead actor and the supposed jokes
Chris Kattan reveals his alarming limitations as and actor here as his one note slapstick routine falls flat about 10 minutes into the film
It is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb, slap stick humor
Will Ferrel, Kattan's SNL partner, seems to have made a full career out of it
The only difference between Kattan and Ferrel is that Ferrel knows when to tone it down and rely on other ways of telling a joke
There is absolutely no diversity in Kattan's routine
It's hard to hear the same joke twice, but for a whole movie that is just pure torture
<br /><br />The other problem with the movie was the lack of truly original and FUNNY jokes
The gay mafia brother, the awkward guy sch-tick, and plenty of other forgettable jokes appear none as funny as the first time you barely laughed at it
It seems as if the screenwriters had more of a fun time writing this than any one had watching it
Even with a cast that has some comedic talent (Chris Penn, Peter Falk) the jokes that commence are tired
This film was obviously one for the pocketbooks for the actors
No body seemed to care about it, or even try
Sad thing is, no body told Chris Kattan that
I ended up watching The Tenants with my close friends who rented the movie solely based on Snoop Dogg's appearance (a passionate fetish of theirs) on the cover
I thought the movie would include the typical array of Snoop Dogg related behavior and imagery often seen in cliché rap videos
However, my generalization was for the most part wrong
Unfortunately, this didn't make the movie any better
<br /><br />Most would describe the movie as a dark serious drama, whereas I would describe it as a dark seriously drawn out boring drama flick
The film tells a story of two struggling writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces
Their polar opposite lifestyles end up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship
This friendship moves throughout the entire movie like a wild roller-coaster - most of which is contributed by Snoop's character - reminiscent of someone with a severe case of split personality disorder
And although the movie is a drama, the acting - which has a morbid and serious tone - from Snoop and company was more comical than anything else
<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie for those who are attention impaired because this one has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue after that
There are some mediocre conflicts, but even they are mostly bogged down with more dialogue
The end, however, jumped at me with a sudden surprise
It was a little bit twisted, somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to wrap up a movie that needed to end
While watching the ending credits I couldn't help but picture the director thinking, "Oh God, how the hell do I end this snoozer
" By the way, the director laid out carefully planted hints and subtleties leading to the climax - all of which are more visible than Waldo in a crowded street of midgets wearing nothing but black sweaters
This movie was slower then Molasses in January
The man who put togeather the preview should get an award for managing to put every one of the 30 seconds that were interisting into the preview
I had to wake up the people I was watching it with, several times
After it was over, I felt bad for having woken them up
<br /><br />Most of the film is taken up with hoping something will actually happen, but nothing ever does
It was easy to loose track of people's motives, and the characters were flat and uninteristing
By the end of the movie, you just hoped everyone would died
Everyone runs around either being contemptible, petty, or pitiful, and usually all three
<br /><br />And worse, we watched a minute or two of the added features, just for kicks and giggles you understand, and all that we saw was people being smug about how socially aware they are
If they had spend the time on the movie that they did patting themselves on the back, it might have been worth watching
<br /><br />I was brought in expecting the excitement of '24
' I got a lecture on social awareness through the blery eyes of the sandman
I had high expectations for this movie and was excited about renting it but was very disappointed when I saw it
It was very poorly written and sort of just fell apart
There wasn't a lot of good anything in this movie except maybe special effects
This movie is written by Charlie Higson, who has before this done the "legendary" Fast Show and his own show based on one of Fast Show's characters (Tony the car sales man)
He's also written James Bond books for kids
<br /><br />Actually I've seen before this only Gordon's movies that are based on Lovecraft's stories, and every one of those is marvelous
Here Gordon tries to do something different
The style is totally "contemporary", which means shaky camera, fast and strange cutting, cool chillout music in the background
It works quite well here, I guess, but it's still pointless and cheap
It makes me often think of the cameraman who's shaking his dv-camera in front of the actors/actresses and try to make stylish moves in the pictures (hoping that something tolerable would come out of it)
The casting is good, and there is a whole atmosphere, which is the result of good directing
I think the main character, the "zero" young guy, is quite interesting in his "zeroness"
And the guy who looks like Alec Baldwin, but is not him
But pretty soon after the beginning the movie turns out to be something not-so-interesting: In this case I mean an endless line of scenes of sadism and sickness
There is not much humanity in this film/story: It's totally pessimistic, and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless, or soon dead
Needless to say that there is no humor either
It's a 1'40 long vomit without no relief in any moment
Anyway, Gordon remains to me one of the most interesting movie makers that are active today, and I think of this movie as an experiment, and as a failure in that
Everyone has to experience getting lost sometimes, just to learn and to find their way again
This might be Gordon's most uninteresting and empty work
I gave this movie a 2, and though I consider myself a science fiction fan, I found this movie very difficult to take seriously
It was on AMC one late night, and I'm glad I saw it for free
This movie is probably good for a few laughs, but not much more
<br /><br />The special effects are about average for the time period - not awful, but not great, either
Of course we know more about Mars now than we did back then, but we really can't hold that against this film
The main reason I did not like this movie is because of the story
<br /><br />There were several parts of this movie that I wish would have been explored in a little more detail - the astronaut's injury/condition, the city on Mars, the creature in the lake, etc
Overall, the movie is much like a lengthy episode of the 1960s version of The Outer Limits - complete with a cheesy ending
After seeing the low-budget shittier versions of the "Universal Soldier" franchise, I hoped and prayed that Van Damme reprised his role as Luc Devoreaux in a second Unisol movie
Well, it seemed this prayer was answered, but not the way I hoped
Universial Soldier 2 is just intense as poetry reading at your local library
The fight sequences are top-notch, Bruce Lee quality, which is the only redeeming factor in this entire pathetic excuse for a motion picture
That and having former WCW tough-guy legend "Goldberg" playing the villain
However, placing Goldberg as Seth's sidekick lieutenant would've been better
<br /><br />We offended me the most was the setting of the movie itself
It's like some film school students slapped it together
The plot holes are that bigger than Kanye West's ego is what really did this movie in
For example: Luc's daughter, Hillary looks like she's at least 11-13 years old and the first movie was filmed only seven years ago
How is that possible? Tell me that! The part in which Luc's partner was killed off and turned into a Unisol is just re-goddamn diculous! You mean to tell me that there was an experimental Unisol exposed naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the movie
The director could've spent more time with this movie like the first one and sewn all the plot holes shut
But oooh nooo! <br /><br />Speaking of the plot, IT SUCKS! Compared to the first movie, Universal Soldier 2's plot watered down and worthless
Where's the gritty thrills in which a Unisol goes berserk an re-enacts his last memories in a supermarket rampage thinking its Desert Storm or something ? This was the dawn of the Millennium, you would attracted more of an audience if this had taken place in a dystopia/Orwellian type of future cesspit
Corny is the correct adjective to describe this sad, sad, sad sequel
<br /><br />From what I seen: Double Impact, Under Siege 2, Robocop 3, and hell, even the cheap-ass/no class Terminator knock-off "Class of 1999" is more entertaining than this
In my knowledge, Largo winch was a famous Belgium comics (never read) telling the adventures of a playboy, a sort of James Bond without the spy life! So, when I had to choose a movie for a 5 years-old kid, I picked it up because the kid was already a great fan of James Bond!<br /><br />But, just after the opening credits, I got heavy doubts: when American movies offer amazing start, here, no action and a torrid sex scene  Then, the story get very complicated with financial moves I thought I lost the kid
<br /><br />But, strangely, he had been caught by Largo, and more than James Bond! <br /><br />Was it the excellent interpretation of Tomer Sisley? The difficult relationship Largo has with his father? The multiple box story in which the friends are the bad guys, the bad guys are the friends? The exotic locations of Honk-Kong, Yougoslavia? <br /><br />Dunno, but he really cares about Largo ("Will he get up?) and we enjoyed our moment
What could have been an engaging-and emotionally charged character study is totally undermined by the predictable factor
Fox is OK as Nathaniel Ayers, the Julliard trained musician who dreams of playing with the Walt Disney orchestra until his bouts with schizophrenia drive him into the street and ultimately skid row
Looking for a good story to boost his flagging career, reporter Steve Lopez {Robert "rehab" Downey } gets to know him and tells his story
Taking every element of the classic "how we hit the skids" movies, borrowing very liberally from "A Beautiful Mind", taking the bogus "feel good" attitude of films like "Rocky"-you pick the sequel number-and whipping up too much 1930s style melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie
It is corny, trite, utterly predictable and plays way too often on our sentiments
I hate to say it, but this is the kind of movie that, if you say you hated it, people will give you bad looks
I really wish I could say something positive about this film, but I really can't
The acting redeems it somewhat, but not enough for me to give it more than one star
In 17th Century Japan, there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages
He is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain
Whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives
Mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved Japan
Shogun Mayeda is a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents
<br /><br />Starring cinema legends Sho Kosugi (Tenchu: Stealth Assassins), Christopher Lee (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings Trilogy), John Rhys Davies (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Indiana Jones Trilogy) and Toshiro Milfune (The Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood), Shogun Mayeda (Kabuto) is a film masterpiece
<br /><br />The Osaka winning stunt team bought to the screen by Bob Ivy bring exciting battle/action sequences such as the opening battle against the Eastern army, the attack on Mayeda's ship carrying priceless jewels and the final confrontation between Sho Kosugi and David Essex
A fine musical score by famed composer John Scott is also present
Director Sho Kusugi was not even nominated for an Oscar for this film which deals with the emotional strife such as the death of Mayedas family, the search for love and acceptance after grieving, all of which is dealt with extremely well
<br /><br />Please note: All of the above is opposite for the film in question
This is a well-worn story about a man who marries to escape the hangman's noose, then sets about "taming" his reluctant bride
It manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time
We never find out, for example, why a woman who won the respect of an Indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband
Or why the members of her team are so eager to get a "real man" in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own
This only made sense in fifties Hollywood
<br /><br />There's a really stupid scene where she horsewhips him and he actually catches the whip--the second time--then yanks her off her horse
Never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye, which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip! Then, he prevails in a fight against her Indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp
Later, he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty Indians (as they all are in these flicks) after they reject her now she's his "squaw"
Never mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and she's been negotiating with them for years
And the way he keeps rejecting her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on him--yeah, right
Like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trail
<br /><br />Finally, neither of the leads is convincing in their roles
Madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky
Fleming flips her hair and scowls a lot, but is totally unconvincing as a fiery tomboy
The only reason you'd root for her is because you want to see Madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the film's end
The way that Madison tames Fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blow-up dolls
Even if you do see them as dolls, the total lack of suspense will bore you
It was a decent movie, I actually kind of enjoyed it
But the ending is so abrupt!! There is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends
What happens after the concert? What happens with her boyfriend? Does she hook up with Grant? Does she come beck in the next semester? And what about Angela? Obviously Holly's performance would knock Angela down a few pegs, but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts
There is so much left up in the air and it's very unsatisfying
I don't know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something, but it is a terrible ending and I think that it really makes the movie a joke
*** REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS *** I'll make this review short and sweet
I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman
How bad could it be, right? Well, it's pretty bad
Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at Edison's Police Force
LL Cool J is Deed, a cop within the force on a special force team called F
He's teamed with an "on-the-edge" bad cop named Lazerov (Dylan McDermott)
In the opening scene we see Lazerov & Deed taking on some bank robbers, but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs
I don't want to give to much away, but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs
Pollack, who works for Ashford (Morgan Freeman) goes to a trial involving Deeds & Lazerov
He suspect foul play and with the help of Ashford, does some investigate that turns ugly
Wallace (Kevin Spacey) who is all within the F
team joins with Ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice
<br /><br />You can tell from the beginning that Freeman and Spacey's performance are pretty lackluster
The only person that give a all out performance is Dylan McDermott
He is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me
He says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion
He was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea & Any Given Sunday
The film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film
<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this film
I registered for IMDb just to comment on this movie
<br /><br />I just got done sitting through this movie, and the only thing that impressed me, was that I somehow had the will power to not stop it
<br /><br />I've seen a pretty decent number of action movies and what not, but Princess Blade has some of the worst fights I've ever seen in a movie
Most of the sword fighting involves mindlessly swinging the swords back and fourth and hoping the opponent isn't doing the same
I've seen a good many student films with better action and stronger plots
<br /><br />So now we have a "futuristic" action movie with poor action, and virtually no sign of the future
<br /><br />Most of the movie doesn't even have any action and shows the developing relationship with the Princess and the farmboy/terrorist and his disturbed sister
The movie has multiple plot lines, and none of them really pan out to be worth anything
<br /><br />Part of the problem may have been that I watched the dub, which was quite bad
The entire cast mumbled all their lines so it was hard to follow what was going on
(Knowing exactly what was said would not have saved the movie in my eyes)<br /><br />If you've heard about this being a futuristic action/ninja flick, then you've heard wrong
Thats what I thought it was when I heard about it, and now I've lost 90 minutes of my life
0 and clearly should rank among IMDb's worst 100 films of all time
National Treasure is an affront to the national intelligence and just yet another assault made on American audiences by Hollywood
Critics told of plot holes you could drive a 16 wheeler through
<br /><br />I love the justifications for this movie being good
" Come on people, no wonder people around the world think Americans are stupid
This has to be the most stupid, insulting movie I have ever seen
If you wanted to see an actually decent film this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways
National Treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific films
I bet most of you reading this haven't even heard of them, since some haven't been widely released yet
<br /><br />Nicholas Cage is a terrific actor - when he is in the right movies
Time after time I've seen Cage waste his terrific talent in awful mind-numbing films like Con Air, The Rock and Face-Off
When his talent is put to good use like in Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation he is an incredible actor
<br /><br />Bottom line - I'd rather feed my hand to a wood chipper than be subjected to this visual atrocity again
Superb recreation of the base in Antarctica where the real events of the film took place
Other than that, libelous!, scandalous! Filmed in Canada; presumably by a largely Canadian crew and cast
I caught the last half of this film recently on Global television here in Canada
Nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled I was at what a blatant piece of American historical revisionist propaganda it is; and starring Susan Sarandon of all people! I can only assume that Canadian born director Roger Spottiswoode was coerced to make the USAF the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air
Jared Diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to domesticate but Europeans did, and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines
<br /><br />But then in the third episode he says that when the Europeans in South Africa got too far north they ran into Zulu people and other tribes that *herded cattle and planted crops*
So what explains their lack of technological, economic, and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for success?<br /><br />Diamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox (brought to North America by black slaves) were our biggest weapon
Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 non-military South Africans can defeat 10,000 Zulus *without a single casualty* in either case, then I think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant
With or without germs, we were going to succeed
<br /><br />He says Malaria stopped Europeans from colonizing further North, killing "thousands" of Europeans while not affecting Africans
(I'd like to know real numbers but he doesn't say
) Then at the end he says today Malaria is killing thousands of Africans and that is why they can't catch up with us
So which is it, Jared? Did Malaria help the Africans by halting Eurpeans or hurt them? And how come Europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history? <br /><br />He also seems far too eager to say that the reasons Europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck
At times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories he's reluctant to admit that maybe Europeans were successful because they worked for it
It's sad watch this obvious neo-Marxist contort reality to try to prove his point
I am not a big fan of Rajnikant in the first place, but Baba was a huge disappointment
In between an awful storyline, the action and songs were only mediocre
Instead of running for office like NTR or MGR, Rajni almost appeared to be running as Tamil Nadu's next big guru
My wife tells me that since this film came out, Rajni swore off doing any more movies!<br /><br />We were lucky initially to have bought Babu (an oldie by Sivajiganeshan) online by accident when trying to buy this one
that was a great film, which made up for having bought this dud
except it makes Baba look even worse by comparison!<br /><br />Brya
during the whole movie nothing ever happens
i almost fell asleep, which in my case happens only if a movie is rally bad
(that is why it didn't get 1 (awful) out of 10 but 2)
don't be fooled, like i was, by first review
a waste of money and your time! spend it on other stuff
at this point i'm finished with my review but i have to fill in at least ten lines of text so i will go on
(ctrl+c, ctrl+v) :))) IT IS A PIECE OF CRAP! not funny at all
during the whole movie nothing ever happens

Throughout the whole movie, I was puzzled and did not see any point to it
I had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was about
Not only is it sick and revolting but totally STUPID! Please don't watch unless you are one of those that likes to watch bad movies
If this movie questions Japanese society and their values and roles, than this is a country that i would not like to visit or bother to know
This is a totally sick movie!!!!!!!! I did not enjoy it because it made no sense
My boyfriend and I sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what it was listed under
'Metamoprhis' is the story of a dashing young scientist, revered at the local college, is brought under investigation by financial providers for the college
This forces him to take shortcuts in typical bad-Hollywood melodramatic fashion
<br /><br />My first thought after this movies conclusion was this
"Not good, but not bad, for early-to-mid eighties
" Of course, I then realized that it was made in 1990, which almost propelled it down to a '4', but decided to keep it at the mediocre '5' that it is
<br /><br />'Metamorphis' does on a few occasions, seem like a good movie desperately trying to get out
The acting, while not stellar, is mostly competent
You can even see the occasional glisten of a modest quality
After thinking I had been watching for ninety minutes, I realized I'd only been watching an hour
Special effects aren't stellar, but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around that weakness
<br /><br />The lead, a mildly charismatic male that seems to be attempting a blended channeling of Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves, reminded me mostly of Matt Dillon's character in 'Wild Things'
The female heroine does an OK job, but does not distinguish herself in anyway
There's a 'naughty girl' role in here, and the actress does what she can with it, but it doesn't seem like much
There is a child actor that the director can't decide if he's morose, cheerful or just weird
<br /><br />Pacing, as I said, is the worst problem with this movie, until a final battle with the bad guy that would make a Power Ranger blush
It is bizarre and inexplicable, until the final scene which is supposed to be dramatic but simply hilarious, saturated with every bad camera trick and overacting that can be compressed in about thirty seconds
<br /><br />A decent one-time watch on the 'Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack'
Nothing that is going to bring you back, and nothing to buy on its own
This is a terrible production of Bartleby, though not, as the other reviewer put it because it is "unfilmable," but rather because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book
Watching it, I could turn the pages in my book and follow along, which is not as much fun when dealing with an adaptation
Rather, see the 2001 version of Bartleby featuring Crispin Glover
That version, while humorous, brings new details to the film while maintaining the spirit of the novel
What's important is the spirit, not the minutiae of things like setting, character names, and costumes
The difference between these film versions is like night and day, tedious and hilarious
This version is a lesson as to what can go wrong if an adaptation is handled poorly, painful, mind-numbing schlock
I went into a Video Store and looked around to find some Horror Movies, after about 30 minutes I just rushed and picked out a few
I stumbled upon "Masters of Horror" which contained "Pro-Life" and "Right to Die"
They seemed OK, same-old cheesy Horror crap, but I was interested for some reason
It said about Pro-Life on the case about being a classic, a return to form for John Carpenter (I loved his "The Thing", so I thought this would be good) and all that
So I turned it on thinking it would be something great and interesting, I was very wrong
It started off casual, just a girl running through a Forest, scared of something
A car stops and picks her up (just so being the people she needed to see, amazing?) They take her back to some Clinic and examine her, at the sametime all this is happening her Father appears at the gates and they don't allow him in, he isn't aloud near the area
Most likely from something he would of done in the past, but you don't know of any of this at the moment
He really does not want his Daughter in this place, an Abortion center
He is very strongly against such acts, believing it's sickening and not what "God" would want
He "supports" what I heard is called "Pro-Life"
Acting against Abortions and going to extremes to allow the Babies to be born, they are sick
They don't like the Life of an unborn being taken, yet they've killed Humans in the past to allow the Birth? Justice is only a figment of the mind
Anyway, back on track, after the girl is examined they find out shes pregnant, but far ahead than what she should be
She is only a few weeks pregnant, but is months ahead
She keeps telling them they wont understand her, and that she wants an Abortion and all, but finally tells the truth that she was raped by a Demon from Hell, and that her Father wants this baby (but believes "God" wants this baby, not who truly does)
He gets his 3 Sons (they arm themselves with Pistols and Shotguns), and begin to make they're way into the Clinic (shooting down anyone who won't co-operate)
The head of the Clinic, who must of had trouble with them in the past, is well prepared this time
Ends up killing one the Fathers Sons, but in the end gets shot a few times (wearing a bullet proof jacket)
The Father then performs what he believes is done to the Women
He cuts a hole, where the Vagina would be if he we're a Female, and sticks some sort of sucking thing up there and sucks out all this blood
Whilst all this is happening, the girl gives birth to some Demonic baby with many legs, and some Demon raises from beneath the Earth (not in the same room) and starts looking for its child
The Father sees this later on, and starts questioning why this happened, he did what he was told to do, and doesn't understand why it's like this
The Demon had killed both of his Sons earlier, and now goes for Father
Whilst the girl kills the baby, and the Demon carries it away (not in the same scene)
<br /><br />Yeah, it probably sounds pretty cool, and a thrilling Horror Movie, but it isn't
The acting is horrible and lacks enthusiasm, the script is boring and not even creative, they choose the wrong characters and don't even build on them; just everything put together, all the small parts, don't even add up to something great, a waste of time
I wouldn't classify this as a Horror, though it has elements of Horror, they ultimately fail at what they try to succeed
It felt more like a "Beginners" Short-Movie, than by John Carpenter
<br /><br />Sorry for my lack of information, and detailed review, I just didn't have the time to waste to write something exciting
Also sorry if my spelling and details are incorrect, I couldn't really be bothered to research anything
First of all, I am a huge fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time
This movie, however, ruined that excitement for me
I am sorry, but Meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool
In the movie, she has straight hair and no glasses and is the "sporty type" with a deep voice
This is not how Madeleine L'Engle pictured Meg to be at all
In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young
This is just one major example how the book and movie are different
So I would say, if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, watch it but if you are a devoted fan of Madeleine L'Engle and her Wrinkle in Time series, I would suggest skipping this movie
If there was ever a call to make a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could become, this one would take the prize
The plot centers around bible prophecies that lie in hidden messages of the scriptures that prompt a group of power-seeking thugs to attempt total control of the world
Just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be? <br /><br /> The acting was bad at best
Casper Van Dien wasted his talent doing this film
Michael York's work was a fair match for the role, since he was the center of the film, and did a good job
<br /><br /> This plot was sickening and very disturbing
No tender or immature minds should see this film
<br /><br /> There must be a lot of mental disease floating around the film circles, who look for ways to market this type of junk
There must have been something censored out to get a PG-13 rating, but it was still awful
"Welcome to Collinwood" is kind of a disaster
Considering the people involved, it should've been multiple times better
<br /><br />Watching it, if you're at least somewhat attached to the faith that it'll get better, will probably make you cry
It's one of those movies that had potential, but was robbed of this potential thanks to a terrible script and some bad acting, not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary George Clooney character and the guy who reminds me of Richard Dreyfuss but about whom I care so little that I don't even want to know his name
<br /><br />The film's only saving grace is the weird con vocabulary it introduces
I found myself thinking of it time and time again as I watched more crime capers
This is the only reason I gave the film a 3
The plot is boring, the characters are neurotic, needlessly offensive, and highly unlikable
They are in a constant state of agonizing stress and they're all so irritating that I celebrated their obstacles
They yell at each other and swear crassly
The dialogue is insipid at best and insultingly stupid at its low points
<br /><br />I find that Steven "Traffic" Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney are to blame for this
They should be tried for war crimes, if anyone actually remembers this crap long enough to care
in an otherwise ghastly, misbegotten, would-be Oedipal comedy
<br /><br />I was the lone victim at a 7:20 screening tonight (3 days after the movie opened) , so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded warnings
<br /><br />The bloom is off Jon Heder's rose
The emerging double chin isn't his fault; but rehashing his geeky kid shtick in another bad wig simply isn't working
It would be another crime if this were to be Eli Wallach's last screen appearance
Diane Keaton will probably survive having taken this paycheck - basically because so few will have seen her in this, the very worst vehicle she's chosen in the last few weeks
<br /><br />Sitting alone in the theater tonight I came alive (laughed, even) whenever Daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the film's sole three dimensional character
<br /><br />In summary, even Jeff Daniels's work can't redeem this picture
Predictable parody, just about failed to impress throughout it's looooooong eight minutes
The only thing that made it worthwhile was the DO NOT COLORIZE line at the end credits
Shame something more entertaining wasn't put on the DVD, like Jonathan Ross' enjoyable profile of Romero on 'The Incredible Strange Film Show
"The Return of Chandu" is notable, if one can say that, for the casting of Bela Lugosi as the hero rather than the villain
<br /><br /> The story as such, involves the Black Magic Cult of Ubasti trying to capture the last Egyptian princess Nadji (the delectable Maria Alba) and use her as a sacrifice as a means of reviving their ancient leader who just happens to look like Nadji
Lugosi as Chandu, who possesses magical powers, tries to thwart the villains
<br /><br /> Director Ray Taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive stock footage
Fans of King Kong (1933) will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep Kong at bay in several scenes
The actor who plays the high priest (I believe Lucien Prival) for example, uses that acting coach inspired pronunciation that was so common in the early talkies
The less said about the others the better
<br /><br /> It is a mystery why Lugosi accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career, because he was still a bankable star at Universal at this time
Maybe it was because in this case he got to play the hero and get the girl, who knows
As his career started to spiral downwards in the late 30s, this kind of fare would become the norm for Lugosi rather than the exception
no, wait, that won't help because the Naked Brothers Band people a retards
You know why I am here even though I am a Naked Brothers Band hater? To warn people before they watch the dumb movie so that the NBB doesn't get any money from it so then they can't make any more amateur stupid songs that are so retarded that any old guy could go and write it in 10 seconds
Not only are the song lyrics retarded, they sing badly
Okay, I'm kinda getting off the movie here
anyways, it was boring and they acted horribly
It was NOT funny at all even though they tried really hard for it to be
I guess they deserve some credit for that
The movie (and the series) is very painful to watch for anyone who has even half a brain
Seriously, if you liked it, you need to go watch movies where the actors actually act, not babbling their lines in a monotone
I am on the drama club at my school and some people there are actually BETTER than those Nat and Alex guys
Hurry before it's too late! I seriously thought that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this piece of poopie
I don't even know why I went through even HALF of that film
I don't think it even deserves to be called a film
The Nutcracker has always been a somewhat problematic ballet
It bears little resemblance to ETA Hoffman's original story on which it is based
<br /><br />In the ballet, the story is essentially over by the second-half when Clara (or Marie in this version) travels to the Kingdom of Sweets to watch a series of character dances
<br /><br />There's an infinite variety of stage productions that re-interpret the story in myriad ways (not always successfully) to compensate for the ballet's weak libretto
<br /><br />Balanchine's version doesn't really have any sense of drama or story at all (despite the fact that there is plenty of drama and mystery in Tchaikovsky's wonderful first-act music)
The result is a completely forgettable first-half Christmas party where hardly anything happens and where even the dancing (the little that there is of it) isn't particularly memorable
<br /><br />The pantomime over-acting, particularly of Drosselmeier, which might look passable on the stage, just looks silly filmed for the big screen
<br /><br />Unfortunately, things aren't much better when we get to the Kingdom of Sweets (Act II in the stage version)
Although there are a few choreographic highlights, most of the choreography is bland and uninspiring
<br /><br />Balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance, but I have always felt he was less successful as a creator of narrative ballets
Watching this film version of his stage production of The Nutcracker has only re-affirmed this view
After seeing the trailer of this film in the cinema, i thought that it was an original concept for a thriller, setting it in the competitive world of computer companies
The all star cast was another message that this film would probably be good
But when i didn't go to watch it in it's first week of release then it disappeared by week 2 i feared something was a miss
Patiently i waited for it's DVD release, then bought it rushing home for an enjoyable evening's viewing
The anticipation on the way home was far better than the film
There's no thought gone into it at all and the director just makes up a part for himself, so he can appear in the film
I wouldn't be rushing out to employ him in the future
Secondly the lead role is completely miscast as Ryan Phillipe
Phillipe normally the cool character as in Cruel Intentions and Way of the Gun but in this he's supposed to be a bumbling hero which he attempts to portray by slipping when he's running and having geeky friends, but he just doesn't look right
The female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani don't feature enough but when they do neither of the performances are close to their bests
The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins in a role that could have been made for him and it's his fiery temper and mysterious ways that drag the film along
The final point is that this film is another one which fills the trailer with scenes you don't see in the film and instead feature only in the deleted scenes section of the DVD
Causing even more disappointment as although some of these scenes are crude they do fill in important gaps in the story
This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life
There are too many mistakes in this movie that it's impossible to keep up
I don't even understand how this movie can get any nomination, let alone 2
Here's why: 1) Sam Lee portrays a angry/irrational detective which was caused by the disappointment from his dad
Cons: When it comes to the explanation scene, he cannot convey the sadness/disappointment he has in his father
The crying scene was too fake and it seems like he is literally squeezing out tears from the corner of his eyes
<br /><br />2) To connect the movie to the title, there were barking or dog wimping sounds during the fight scenes and rape scene, which is totally irrelevant and confusing to the viewer
I understand that it's supposed to be a metaphor or what not
but it's just sooo dumb! 3) WHY THE HECK DID THE COPS NOT SHOOT THE KILLER? What the heck is wrong with this movie
When the killer started stabbing an officer, SHOOT him
He's already dead! What the heck? There were lots of opportunity that the killer could be killed, but I do not know why he wasn't! 4) During the scene where the girl had her foot hurt
In the scene, it was very clear that the LEFT foot of the girls was hurt, so how the heck in the next scene that she's lending all her weight on her left foot? And this is the actress nominated as the best new performer? WTF? 5) The sounds in the movie are off sync
<br /><br />6) I am guessing that this movie is trying to bring awareness of the brutality and violence among children in South East Asia, so why does the bad guy wins and then the cop was joining the fight? 7) This movie is just too violent without a purpose
Cops are beating CI to a pulp and then if they cooperate, they give them marijuana and coke? This is overall the worst movie
I truly feel that the person who wrote this movie is a sadist and sick person
I have never seen a more disgusting movie in my whole entire life
Everyone involved (and the audience) should seek out "The Candidate" to see how good this movie could have been
What happened the South American story? What were Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw thinking to allow their roles to be cardboard cut-outs
Up to now I have liked every Gene Hackman performance and/or movie
He was either disinterested (which I can hardly believe) or dreadfully miscast
I have also liked and defended Richard Gere (and been vilified for it)
He was never intimidating and only occasionally persuasive
I really expected much more from this director and cast
If you can't find "The Candidate" watch "Wag the dog" again or even "Bulworth"
Dull haunted house thriller finds an American family moving into a 200 year old house in Japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred
<br /><br />Novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of Motel Hell
The film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall
<br /><br />One obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned
The monk recounts the history of the house (which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence) and then the film simply cuts away to something else
Well, where is the help? The family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier--try to drive the spirits out of the house, although by this time it's difficult for the viewers to care
<br /><br />There are some (probably) unintentional campy laughs in seeing the American actors at the end become possessed by the Japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts, I say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same director's Motel Hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing, but on the whole this is a forgettable dud
If i could have rated this movie by 0 i would have ! I see some ppl at IMDb says that this is the funniest movie of the year , etc etc excuse me ? are you ppl snorting LSD or
? There is absolutely NOTHING funny about this movie N O T H I N G ! I actually want my 27 minutes back of my life that i spent watching this piece of crap
<br /><br />I read someone sitting on an airplane watching this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes , i totally understand that , i actually would have watched snakes on a plane for 2 times over instead of watching this movie once ! <br /><br />DO NOT watch this movie , do something else useful with your life do the dishes , walk the dog , hell
anything is better than spending time in front of the TV watching hot rod
The monster from Enemy Mine somehow made his way into a small mountain community, where he has taken up residence
He's being hunted by a female doctor-turned-vigilante who is out to exterminate him
This female assassin, who looks like a refugee from a Motley Crue video, rides around on a motorcycle and tries to save a bunch of kids who have chosen to have a Big Chill weekend right smack dab in the middle of the monster's turf
Decapitations and lots of blood are primarily in place to draw attention away from the story which limps along like a bad version of the Island of Dr
Moreau (and yes, it's worse than the one with Val Kilmer)
I kinda liked the film despite it's frenzied pace
BUT, I did not appreciate the comment that Canada was referred to as Montana North
It is definitely NOT Montana North and never will be
Americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world, and that is one reason why
Stop teaching the kids of the United States of America to think they own the planet
Such a centrist world view is not becoming of one of the world's great nations
I would never refer to the USA as 'Alberta South'
Walt would never put us down, so why start now
Other than that the film was pretty goofy, better luck next time
OK we all love the daisy dukes, but what is up with this cast
Lets start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is not one thing country about this girl and Daisy was not ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original
No offense to Burt, but I never noticed Boss HOg being so tall
That was part of the humor of Boss Hog was his size
Did they even try someone like Danny Devito?!? OK , now get this they cast Jessica Simpson did anyone take a look at her husband? He matches Luke Duke to a tee!!!!!! Cleary these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members
The screen t's were never present on the dukes!! This made the movie a turn off from the beginning
Nothing to say but Wow! Has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field? Well this happens about 25 times in this movie(clearly the directors' favorite scare tactic)
In one of the opening scenes the smooth talking/hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film
Shortly after he arrives to the field the 5 contestants show up and, although it is clearly at latest 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute
After about 30 minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clown's history in which we see some of his previous victims
If you watch this movie check out the ladies chest
her ribs go all the way to her neck, it was flat out disgusting
Most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day
The few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the Blair Witch Project or random shots from the directors backyard
The movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically
<br /><br />Definitely RENT THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN SNUCK UP ON IN AN OPEN FIELD
Originally aired as an ABC Movie of the Week
This involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little Southern town
They aren't allowed phone calls and nobody knows they're there
What follows is rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusion
<br /><br />The TV version was (for its time) grim
No nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness wore one down
The unrated version is even worse--there's plentiful nudity, the violence is extreme and, in one particularly disgusting sequence, we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard "uses" her
YUCK! There's nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink
You get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these poor women being tortured and degraded--all this is shoved in your face like you're supposed to enjoy it
The needlessly downbeat ending doesn't help
<br /><br />I'm giving it a 3 because the acting is good--but that actually makes the movie harder to watch
Just emailed a friend who's in film school about this flick
Something to avoid when making a film - characters blabbering senseless, overwrought, convoluted monologues on screen that are ultimately trite and unconvincing
If the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal barrages are so over-the-top that they actually draw attention to the film constructed as film and effectively neutralize that intent
Is it the acting, or the script that is bad, or both?<br /><br />The protagonist is also highly unbelievable for social realism - ravenously consuming canonical English literature and the bible while high or hungover and able to produce such profoundly sophomoric soliloquies while intoxicated? And how is such an unattractive, unwashed and verbally noxious character able to bed most of the women he meets within minutes of encountering them? (I had to applaud when one chick finally threw him out onto the street, despite his whining and self-pitying banter)
<br /><br />The viewer encounters pretentious references to Ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the Book of Revelations
The impending doom of mankind, in the form of bar codes imprinted on our foreheads or right hands in spooky biblical fashion, is presented to a character who is oh-so-cleverly exposed in his role as a guardian of empty space
<br /><br />This flick is over-scripted and over the top - a melodrama clumsily infused with pedestrian "philosophy" about the meaning of mankind, life, etc
<br /><br />There are some very fine English films available with content similar to this film
"Nil by Mouth" is an excellent, far more interesting excursion into the lives of individuals in a similar social milieu
" And although the comparison is not even warranted, check out anything by Peter Greenaway, who far more deftly handles dialogue, wit and absurd characters and situations
When I first saw the cover of this movie (a giant bug chasing a few nurses) And the name "Blue Monkey", I knew I wasn't in for any big Hollywood movie
I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Railsback in this cheese-ball flick, who always does a good job in whatever role he tackles
The FX are pretty corny, there isn't too much of a plot, and I'm still not sure why this movie is called Blue Monkey, because there is nothing in this movie to do with monkey
But come on people, what did you expect?? It's not really as bad as it seems
If you enjoy the old 50's style black and white bug attack movies, this one is basically an updated version, without the updates special F
This ABC straight-to-TV failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is A Wrinkle in Time
Madeleine L'Engle brought children and adults alike into a magical, fantastical and original world like no author before her
This novel, the first in her 'time quartet', is a beautiful take on life, the universe, and time itself
Yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand
Its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book
This film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of Ms
Honestly, what were they thinking? The effects look cheap and ridiculous, the plot is mushy and uneven, the dialogue is far-fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost
This was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen
I sincerely hope that someday an intelligent, worthy director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuarón) makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is: a masterpiece
This adaptation can only be compared to boring, fake and cheap motel-room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience
This is an in-name-only sequel to "A Christmas Story," originally entitled "A Summer Story
" Ralphie narrates his family adventures during the summer when they moved to a small hick-town in the middle of nowhere
<br /><br />The original worked because of its irreverent nature and honesty - everyone could relate to it
This one is simply stupid and not very funny at all
Charles Grodin's last movie - no wonder! It's one of his poorest roles
<br /><br />Mary Steenburgen is given little to do, everything's formulaic, and you have to wonder why they even bothered
<br /><br />And I mean, come on - a competition with spinning tops?! Sadly, it's the best part of the movie
Friends is a comedy of very basic humour aimed at teenagers and young adults, with unsophisticated sense of humour
<br /><br />It is also painfully obvious that towards the end, they were desperately trying to make it last 10 seasons, most likely so they could say they beat Seinfeld's 9 season run
The trouble with this is, Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing, Friends had (and I'm being very generous here) at most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons
<br /><br />It became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that weren't that good so start with, then got worse at the 100th time you saw them
I find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly
Had the original casting idea been kept (hunting Rutger, not Ice-T), this movie might have worked
Sadly, racism had to come into the picture (literally) and mess it up
The predominantly black production staff couldn't allow the antagonist be black, so they swapped Rutger's and Ice-T's roles
This was only the start of the downward spiral of this film
Ernest Dickerson's news-room approach to 'directing' only verified that this was another affirmative-action job assignment
Gads, 'Who's Line Is It Anyway' even uses more creative camera work
Eric's rewrite of 'The Most Dangerous Game' is at least an attempt at modernizing the classic tale, but fails to give us any motivations for why the characters are doing this
We are never given the reasons, other than "no one will miss these people", why the leader (re-written as Rutger) does these things
Aside from a heart-felt performance by John McGinley, and a fair job by Charles Dutton, do not bother with this one
One small bit of trivia, there was a real drunk-driving accident during filming that injured F
Murray Abraham, and resulted in the death of the intoxicated young driver that caused the accident
It's hard to believe people actually LIKE this dreck! I do think kids can enjoy it, but to me it's the kind of kid film parents can't bear to sit through
Predictable plot, boring Belushi, and possibly the worst kid actor of all time
I will give the director some of the responsibility for the kid, but she was truly painful to watch
I feel embarrassed for her now, having people know it was her
When she sang the Star Spangled Banner I had to turn the sound off--then I came here and discovered they did that because she won Star Search
I've always felt Jim Belushi should be ashamed to trade on the name of his wonderful, sadly missed brother, and this crap shows why
I am a HUGE Adam Sandler fan, and one day I was looking at the Cast&Crew selection on one of his DVD's and saw 'Going Overboard' and decided to go out and rent it
So I went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it
We put it on and we were shocked to see an Adam Sandler that didn't hit puberty yet, he looks as if he was 12 when this movie came out
I couldn't even watch 30 minutes of this crap, I didn't laugh, chuckle, or even smirk at this movie, actually the only time I smirked was when I saw how horrid this movie was
I could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie
Although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script I realized why I had never heard of this movie,
because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before
This movie, in my opinion, was the WORST movie EVER made,
Boston legal has turned its tail and is headed for the barn door and th pig slop it has created! When this show first aired almost four season back it was a humorous slap at the legal system which all actors seem to take pride in portraying
It was funny, diversified, and to some extent factual
The characters portrayed were acceptable and to an extent real in their portrayals
The sexual comment and activity were limited and humorous
Julie Bowen is and was beautiful as in other series she participated but is now dragged to the lower depths of Media programming of sex and violence
Julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this "production"
Rene Adjurdubois Is an excellent actor who has from the days of "Benson" to this production held his own in the field of entertainment, always showing the humor and respectful acting of the production
Funny and humorous is Candace Bergan and is to be admired for her continuing in this production and is a good actress
James Spader, there is no doubt in his acting ability, however he should go back to his XXX origins such as "Crash" as it appears he has much talent and inclination in that direction
We ask that this series be trashed as it already is and its really starting to smell!!
I watched this movie also, and altho it is very well done, I found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women who have small children
The terror on this mother's face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking
And the sad thing is--internally she dies
Eventually she goes back to the Applacian mountains
All the money in the world which she makes from making dolls does not conceal the grief she has
I remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child healed
I'm surprised this movie takes place in Detroit, because when I watched it I thought for sure the people had come to Cincinnati, Ohio
This also was a route for the poor from the mountains
This only gets bashed because it stars David Hasselhoff
Compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays, this film isn't too bad
She is super hot, but can't talk very well
There is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped
Linda Blair does nothing here as well as Hasselhoff
Think of this film as a Saturday morning live-action program from ages ago
Even the small tykes will find this one hard to please because it runs like molasses! I can't fully understand how god awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting, especially in the costume department! Too many warrior-wizard movies out there have used the same old plotline numerous times over, but this is mighty scarce considering its appeal to the little darlings
And who in the world would've let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place? I thought this was a "family" movie! MST3K, here's another fine gem for your 1999 TV season
The only connection this movie has to horror is that it is horribly unentertaining
I would rather prick my finger with a rusty nail than have to sit through it again
The screenplay is as exciting as a bowl of sand
How two directors conspired to create such a nothing movie will remain one of the great mysteries of the 20th Century
There is only one scene even vaguely worthy of inclusion in the Omen franchise, and it is shot in slo-mo and cut short at the anticipated pay-off
If you are tempted to see this, pop it in, set your alarm clock for 90 minutes and get comfy
With any luck you'll doze off quickly, and the alarm will wake you once the worst is over
Shortly after seeing this film I questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role
Elizabeth Shue is a commendable actress, why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity? I must give credit where credit is due, though
Some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing, but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of Kevin Bacon's character, Sebastian Caine
I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, man or woman, that has any form of self-respect to account for
How could I not love it? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; all icons in their own way
However, the train wreck that was Suzy Parker ruined the entire experience for me
Her acting was so appalling that I sat there with my jaw hanging open, not believing my eyes or ears
I could barely make it through one viewing, THAT'S how hideous she is in this
<br /><br />Cary? Gorgeous and in fine dramatic form
Jayne? Adorable, endearing, and obviously having a ball
The supporting cast does alright, and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its stunning, retro elegance
<br /><br />Then you see Suzy Parker attempting to speak her lines with a woodenness, a deadness, a cluelessness that simply defies belief
Who told this creature she could ACT?? Oy VEY, people
There will be a time where kids will have grown up without ever seeing the one and only Bugs Bunny kiss (technically) another man on the lips
There will be a time where it won't be Duck or Rabbit season
There will be a time where the Tazmanian Devil will be dubbed politically incorrect
<br /><br />But so help me now is not that time
<br /><br />Nobody really wants an 'EXTREME' version of our beloved Loony characters
Whoever it is in marketing who comes up with "Corn Nuts: Corn gone wrong" and "Extreme Doritos" and evidently this festering turd should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising or whatever doesn't mean they know jack about kids
<br /><br />I think that they're doing a disservice to children, depriving them of one of the greatest and most iconic shows of all time
This show disgusts me, and it's not just the dated artwork or terrible dialogue
They misuse good voice talent, like Phil Lamarr, Michael Clarke Duncan, Candi Milo, and so many others
It lacks style, humor, character development, and most importantly, heart
<br /><br />The show, like it's repackaged characters (Slam Tasmanian, Rev Runner, Ace Bunny) is but a shadow of it's former, timeless and beautiful self
With no affinity towards any type of filmmaking, and a healthy appreciation of documentaries, I can honestly say I was angry at myself for bothering to sit through the entire length of "20 Dates"
I won't waste your time with the plot, you may read other reviews
I will say though that Berkowitz's hyper, Woody Allen-style narration was extremely annoying
You either wished he'd lay off the coffee or ingest some tranquilizers
And it's potentially apparent to Berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea, as parts of it details his trials to finance the documentary
Forgive me for disguising insults as compliments, but I'll give credit to Berkowitz for having the skills to convince some idiot to finance this horrid piece of ****
I appreciate the boundaries & intentions of the film here, but even when regarding the standards Berkowitz sets for himself, he fires off and misses on all levels
In closing, I'm sure many of these female companions were not at ease going on a date with a twitchy wanna-be filmmaker, and therefore I question the film's sense of authenticity
Hey Myles, I loved your film the first time I saw it
when it appeared as an episode of Seinfeld or was a film directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith
I happen to have bought one of those "Legacy of Horror" 50 movie pack collections and would you believe I'm still looking through them to find a good HORROR movie in it
Sometimes you find an enjoyable yet campy one like The Devil's Messenger or The Devil Bat, or one of the great Alfred Hitchcock's films (some aren't horror however and are only on there because Hitchcock directed some horrors and suspense) but other times it seems that they put movies like The Island Monster and this on because they can't accept the fact they would easily be forgotten and should be for that matter
<br /><br />So we open up to sort of a Westing game idea
The rich yet cruel and abusive father played by Carradine (the one standing feature of this) has died and left his inheritance to his children and servants who he still hates
Carradine gives a good enough performance as always, but he's left mainly in a voice recording and flashback sequences leaving us to sit through the mediocre/terrible performances
The rest of the cast either overacts or underacts in scenes
Given this was an independent film of the 70's the lighting and effects are pretty limited
It's hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer can't see what's happening that well in some scenes
Some actors like the servants Igor and Elga give an effort at least and I'm ashamed to admit kind of left me chuckling at the end mainly for the sheer stupidity but still with some very minor happiness that they pulled some version of a twist to an otherwise pretty obvious who-done-it but not enough to enhance the quality of the film
You aren't meant to like the characters as they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic, but it takes it to a whole new level and makes many unwatchable
The death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there
It proves that you would probably enjoy the 20 movie pack "Chilling" containing films like House on a Haunted Hill, Little Shop of horror's with Jack Nicholson, and Night of the Living Dead over it
Like watching a neighbor's summer camp home movies, "Indian Summer" is a sleep inducing bore
Eight alumni campers are barely introduced, when unbelievably boring flashbacks begin for characters we know nothing about
Fine actors, Alan Arkin, and Bill Paxton are totally wasted in this film
One camper's observation that "everything seems so much smaller than I remember it" is repeated at least ten times, enough to make you squirm
The anticipated pranks are neither funny or original, unless you think that short sheeting is a real "howler"
This movie was a great disappointment considering the ample talent involved
"Indian Summer" did not make me homesick, just sick
I just saw this 1995 version of Bye Bye Birdy on Sky TV
I didn't know it existed and was fully prepared to see the 1963 film version when I turned it on
<br /><br />I played Albert a long time ago and I am thinking of putting on an amateur production of the show because I remembered it as being so much fun to do
I was not impressed with this newer version
This is not a moody musical, it is bright and up beat
The lighting decision was a poor creative choice
<br /><br />Bye Bye Birdy is a farce, a comedy of errors
The lighting was awful and it dulled the overall performances
At least the dance numbers should have measured up to some of the best of those, or how about some of the best of Broadway
The choreographer was asleep at the wheel it seemed
<br /><br />Although all the actors were supremely talented, there were some really bad casting choices
Vanessa Williams is not Latin, and with so many talented Latin performers out there, wouldn't it have been more correct to cast one of them in the role of Rosie
Vanessa is African American, lovely and talented, but bad casting
Jason Alexander's effort was astounding, he always does intelligent work, but he just wasn't Albert
He was miscast and I think that is obvious to most people who see this version
<br /><br />The medium of film is not the medium of stage
There needs to be translation from one medium to another
The exuberance and the flash of stage musical must be TRANSLATED to film
There is no merit being faithful to a stage script when it is being filmed
The spirit, the essence of the production must be brought forth
To me the 1963 film production of Bye Bye Birdy was bright and lively, while the 1995 production was as gloomy as the lighting and as lackluster as the dance numbers
It turned out to be an unfortunate waste of effort by many really talented people
I am a big fan of old horror movies, and since I am middle aged, old to me is a movie made before 1970 with most being made in the 1920's to 1960's period
I am not a big fan of more modern horror movies, with one exception being Creepshow 1, which I thought was great
I could reminisce about the stories there but I really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with Hal Holbrook, and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending
So why did I like them so much? The characters had some decent development, the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad, the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear, and the funny bits were really funny! This sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent! I am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on IMDb
When George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get top billing it's telling you something
Also, Romero's expertise is hard to find here, they must had told him to tone it down to a PG standard (I don't know what this was rated at but it looks PG to me), and that's not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on
It's shown on the Encore cable channel if your dieing (yuck yuck) to see it
This is one of the worst films I've seen in years!! You could randomly pluck 5 people off the streets and they could act better than anyone in this film
I only gave it a 2 as I like gory films but this is just plain rubbish
The acting (and I use that term VERY loosely) is abysmal, someone please tell me that the 5 main actors in this were making their first ever film?? Don't waste your time watching this
I cannot believe that someone has spent money making this, I hope for the producers sake it only cost $50,000 to make - it looks like a school project, made by kids who haven't got a clue
Although this isn't a "great film," there's something compelling and memorable about it
Like another commenter on the film, I saw this in childhood
It's been thirty three years since 1952, but I have never forgotten the story or its ridiculously cumbersome title
You'll feel like a voyeur of small town life as it evolves through the decades
More than any other film, this one brings a human face to the historical drama of early twentieth century "progress
" It's engaging enough for a young viewer and memorable enough for an older one
Furthermore, it's easy to like the characters and watch their passage through time
For me, this movie just seemed to fall on its face
The main problem for me was the casting of Glover as a serial killer
I don't know whether this grows out of type-casting or simply his demeanor, but I doubt Glover could ever portray a convincing villain
He's a good guy, and that's always obvious in his performances
Other than that the film is your run of the mill serial killer story
Guy gets the girl kind of thing at the end
And London has a Monorail? Bank of London??? Bank of England is what it really is!! - I did however like the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves
And the Brits were baddies? (apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) What was up with that? Oh and they kept on saying stuff like "Here come 'The Thunderbirds'" - but it was never known as 'The Thunderbirds' in the series, why do that?? I'd like to see this re-made in 20 years with more British cast
Since I had loved the Inspector Gadget cartoon in the 80's, I went to see this movie
Also, the movie could not keep me interested for long
<br /><br />If you want to see Inspector Gadget, watch the cartoon instead
The perfect murder is foiled when a wife(played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once the wife to director Robert Zemeckis, who helmed this episode), who murders her husband with a poker, has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside
an escaped insane madman dressed in a Santa Claus suit(played by a deviously hideous Larry Drake)
She fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband's corpse
She decides to use an ax, once she downs the Santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman's head, to frame the killer for her husband's murder
Santa killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman's daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child
<br /><br />This episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT just recycles tired material involving the old "Santa kills" theme while also adding the oft-used(add nauseum)woman-murders-her-husband-for-a-man-she's-been-cheating-with routine
It's essentially Trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac
There's nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions
Not exactly a new story line, but this romantic comedy makes the concept work
A young man(John Cusack) and a drop dead gorgeous woman(Kate Beckinsale)keep meeting by chance and wonder if they are meant for each other
oddly enough they still feel that their soul mate is out there somewhere
A little sappy in some places, but viva la love
Being a romantic I am almost obligated to be riveted
My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and snow starts falling
The finale is almost too sweet, but most deserving
This is not one of Cusack's deeper roles, but who in the hell could not be smitten by Beckinsale
Notable support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon
John Corbett plays the worst role I've ever seen him in
On the other hand Eugene Levy is quirky and funny
In The Lost Son, a private eye searching for a missing man stumbles upon a child prostitution ring
This film incorporates all of the worst stereotypes you could imagine in a worst-case scenario that exists only in the minds of Hollywood, the press and AG John Asscrap
If you get a chance to see this, you'd be better off getting lost yourself
This film reminded me of The Sopranos, and not in a good way
<br /><br />David Chase's seminal mob opera only ever put its foot wrong twice, the most jarring and inexplicable instance of which took place in its fourth season, when Junior Soprano went on trial for his life
Rather than pursue this riveting (and pivotal) plot line, the writers instead chose to completely ignore it, focusing instead on Bobby Baccalieri's constant whimpering over his recently deceased wife's frozen pasta dish
<br /><br />When something of genuine interest happens in Notorious - for example that first, mysterious assassination attempt on Tupac Shakur that ignited the whole East Coast/West Coast feud in the first place, and ended up leading to the deaths of both Tupac and Christopher Wallace - the film treats it as just another bit of plot to plod through
Why exactly was Tupac so convinced that he was sold out by his own people? Did he alone nurture his subsequent affiliation with Suge Knight? And was Lil' Kim's transformation from prim office drone into sex-obsessed, vampish diva really as banal as it appears here?<br /><br />None of these questions are even fleetingly addressed by the film's screenwriters, who are far more interested in depicting Wallace's turbulent love life to zero compelling dramatic avail
These sequences (including a brain-frazzlingly clichéd groupie indescretion in a hotel room) are so toothless and bruisingly manipulative that the only real comparison to be made is with a network TV movie
<br /><br />The storytelling, in both structure and content, is simplistic and trite
But more fundamentally, as a biopic; as something designed to celebrate its subject and educate the uninitiated on the intricacies of their life and work; the film is almost entirely worthless
The reliance on meat-and-potatoes genre plotting, coupled with the lifeless musical performances (an area in which a film like this should soar, surely) result in a film that appears to have been designed only to satisfy the whims and demands of those involved, leaving Wallace's questionable status as a giant in his field as the preserve of the easily persuaded and previously converted only
<br /><br />And the final twenty minutes, in which Wallace's posthumous cultural identity is broadly painted as being akin to that of a latter day saint, quite frankly made me feel like throwing up
<br /><br />On that score, much as with any other, Notorious is crass, calculating and compromised
GUERNSEY (Maria Kraakman - Belgium/Netherlands 2005)
<br /><br />The mousy Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a woman in her thirties, who finds out her husband (Fedja van Huet) is cheating on her but she doesn't dare to confront him
She painfully avoids any confrontation with human beings, her parents as well as her sister, so we have a main character in a feature film that doesn't do much at all
We barely know anything about her background or her motivations
Just a woman who seems to be stuck in a blind alley, not just during this difficult episode of her life
She obviously suffers from something, but why do we in the audience have to suffer as well?<br /><br />I almost gave up on cinema after seeing this unwatchable mess
These were a very dull and painful 90 minutes
Normally I try to avoid wasting energy on bad film making
I'll take the beating and roll with the punches, but in this case a fair warning is in place
How on earth did Nanouk Leopold get funding (in large part from publicly financed funds) for this turkey? Obviously, there was no script to speak off
It could be compensated by an ingenious filmmaker with cinematographic ideas or a cast with only a little more appeal
None whatsoever, just a vaguely defined concept, "I want to do something from a woman's point of view"
The result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on life
<br /><br />To make things worse, there's not an interesting shot to be found in the entire film
I cannot think of a cast who could have spiced this one up, but Johanna ter Steege is a (small) light in the dark, if possible with this dire lack of material
I'm trying to imagine how Leopold tried directing Maria Kraakman: "Maria, look at the horizon, we'll film you for three minutes, just express sadness"
Get a copy and watch this late at night, guaranteed too put you to sleep
Don't get fooled with all the big names like Burt Reynolds,James Woods and Anne Archer
Their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so
Whatever their motives for being in this movie, if you have an actor like James Woods you better make good use of him
To me this is a sign of bad direction through and through
And the acting from most of the actors was above average
He was so unbelievable that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes
And since this was meant as a serious movie that can't be a good thing
The action scenes were not bad,but they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting
Also the pacing was wrong for a movie like this
It took the main character almost half an hour to get in action
For an action thriller of only 90 minutes that is far too slow
The only redeeming factor is Angie Harmon
Yes,this movie could have been much better with a great director
Andy Cheng is far too inexperienced as a director to pull it off
And for an action/stunt coordinator of his caliber you'd expect at least more exciting action scenes
I guess this movie is a fitting tribute to the first Superman film,as it is just as crummy and painfully long as the original
<br /><br />After an opening scene consisting solely of murky intergalactic visuals, the credits pay homage to the even-crummy-looking-for-their-time futuristic sweeping credits of the original Superman film
<br /><br />Then there is some more murky stuff
Ma Kent sees some kind of murky ruckus on the farm, and spends a good portion of my life slowly walking up to some debris in the cornfield
Then Superman sneaks up on her and faints
<br /><br />Next we catch up with Lex Luthor in a scene about many murky close-ups of an old lady as she dies
We don't see Luthor's face until the end of the scene, an early instance of the film's drive to leave no hackneyed stone unturned
Lex Luthor is a guy who doesn't like Superman because he is not human
Also, he probably doesn't like humans either, as the movie occasionally features some kind of plot about Lex Luthor planning to kill most of Earth's population
<br /><br />After a while, Clark Kent shows up back at his old job (I forgot to mention, he had been away on a five year trip where nothing happened)
Then he finds out Lois Lane has an illegitimate kid and is dating Cyclops
It upsets him so much that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame
<br /><br />At this point we see that Miss Lane is on some kind of jet attached to some kind of space shuttle
It is some kind of important event on account of it is on television
Then we learn that there are people in a control room monitoring this event
There are also people watching it on television and there are pilots in the cockpit
The film then reminds us that these people are involved by cutting between them for most of the summer
<br /><br />As the events leading up to the inevitable disaster started to build, I excused myself to get a soda
I accidentally walked back into the wrong theater and watched that movie about Al Gore showing slides in its entirety
I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns, but I somehow wandered into Prairie Home Companion, which I watched twice in a row
<br /><br />I walked back into the first theater, found my seat, and looked up to see that the impending Lois Lane space shuttle disaster was almost upon us
Still, it seemed to be taking forever, so I wandered around the theater, met a girl, got married, raised a son and sent him off to college
While attending my son's medical school graduation, I remembered that I should probably check in on Superman Returns, so I excused myself and raced back to the theater only to learn there was no need to hurry
It still took about another half hour before things went wrong for Space Shuttle Lane
When they did, Superman saved everybody, which was pretty cool
And then there is a a subplot where Superman turns really creepy and starts stalking Lois Lane and her family with his x-ray vision and super-hearing
Then he tries to get her to cheat on Cyclops, who seems like a good guy
<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lex Luthor is involved in some kind of contest to display every possible generic villain behavior before the end of the movie
I forgot to bring my scorecard home with me (they give you one at the door), but I think he scored damn close to one hundred percent
<br /><br />At this point, things start to gear up for the big murky finale
I think maybe the projector was broken, on account of the movie seemed to be in some kind of loop for a while here
I remember seeing murky things growing out of the water, Superman getting sick, Superman getting better, back to the murky things, he's sick again, no wait, he's okay again
<br /><br />Then Lex Luthor unleashed his final bad guy move: yelling at his girlfriend a little bit
<br /><br />Then Superman died and came back to life
<br /><br />Ninety years later, the nursing home where I lived felt a little chilly
I realized I left my sweatshirt back in the theater, and I went to retrieve it
When I did, I was slightly surprised to find that Superman Returns wasn't over yet
I tried to ask some of the viewers what I missed, but most of them were only skeletons with long gray beards by now
<br /><br />I sat back in my old seat and watched as Lois Lane puttered around her house for a while
Then Superman showed up and started quoting the beginning of the movie, and since I already saw that part I thought it was okay to leave
<br /><br />So that is my review of Superman Returns
<br /><br />Oh, also, if you like jokes about people eating dogs or jokes about one dog eating another dog, you will love this movie
On account of there are two jokes like that in it
If 1977's "Exorcist II: The Heretic" did him no favors, it's hard to imagine what thespian extraordinaire Richard Burton saw in this drab exercise in non-thrills
You've seen it all before: Burton plays a writer who discovered at an early age he possesses the power to move inanimate objects through force of his mind (and you thought "Carrie" had no impact on Hollywood!)
Though adapted from a novel by Peter Van Greenaway, "Medusa" plays like recycled goods, though the special effects in the cathedral finale are solid (if typical)
Lee Remick is somewhat present as a doctor, but otherwise the supporting cast is extremely weak
not even telekinesis could save him at this point
It seems there's a bit of a curse out there when it comes to gay cinema
Beautiful Thing excluded, gay films tend to end in broken relationships or untimely death
<br /><br />The creators of this horrid piece of nonsense have a thing or two to learn about plot, direction, and timelines
Within the first ten minutes of this film, I found myself a bit confused, and even more so after the first glimpse of Jeremie Elkaim's character having a little psych session
It seems this film was randomly pieced together without the slightest attempt at continuity or consistency
There's no real way to tell when you're viewing the present or some sort of ethereal flashback
I could only take so much before it became truly unappealing
<br /><br />Stephen Holden of The New York Times called this film "
" Well, it seems that Stephen invested in beer goggles prior to viewing, as this is truly far from beautiful
Due to all the praise this film received, I expected something worth watching
And by the end of the movie (which provided no resolution whatsoever, I might add) it's plain to see that the writers, the director and the film have all Come Undone
One more of extremely unprofessional movies about computer programmers
<br /><br />Looks authors of that movie don't know real specific of programmers world
<br /><br />20 top programmers in the world, program which have own satellites (for what?), program which using satellite freq
, somebody kill somebody to steal the codes (why?) and much more of stupid moments at this movie
<br /><br />Peoples who not programmers not will see something awful at that movie, because not professionals on this
<br /><br />Programmers will find that movie odd and awful - because lots of moments inside movie is not RELATED real life (why movie not scifi in this case?)
Except people apparently buy into this garbage! As shows like "Moral Orel" have shown, even if you tried to make the most outrageous, over-the-top parody of evangelism you could possibly think of, it wouldn't come close to the hilarity of this show
It's hard to tell what's even going on when you're watching it
Is it a news show? A talk show? Who knows!? They start out by reporting on various international news stories, but at seemingly random points, the news is interrupted by this odd, troll-like little man with a forehead bigger than his entire face, mumbling and laughing and generally being creepy
<br /><br />Pat Robertson doesn't even seem like such a bad guy at first glance
He just seems like a senile, yet harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents)
But this is a man who has called for an assassination, who has befriended and offered aid to not one, but TWO murderous dictators, who has illegally used donation money to run diamond mines, who has SUPPORTED forced abortions in China, and who regularly implies that Caucasians (straight American male Caucasians in particular) are superior to all other races
<br /><br />Still, this would all be funny, except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep his little show on the air 40 years later (either that, or enough money to bribe some TV executives who don't give a damn what they show)
The idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people, somewhere, must be watching it and hanging onto every word
Even when Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is, people still listen to him
That's what my friend Brian said about this movie after about an hour of it
I had been ranting about how execrable it was and finally I relented and played it, having run out of adjectives for "boring"
<br /><br />Imagine if you will, the pinnacle of hack-work
Something so uninspired, so impossibly dreadful, that all you want to do after viewing it is sit alone in the dark and not speak to anybody
Some people labor under the illusion that this movie is watchable
It is not, not under any form of narcotic or brain damage
I would ONLY recommend this to someone in order to help them understand how truly unbearable it is
<br /><br />Granted, as a nation, we in America don't always portray Middle Eastern peoples in a tasteful manner
But how about a kid in a sheik outfit bowing in salaam-fashion to a stack of Castrol motor oil bottles? You'll find that here
Having the kid fly planes into a skyscraper would've been more appropriate
Who in their right mind would think that was a funny joke? It's not even close to "cleverly offensive"
It just sucks and makes you want to punch whomever got paid to write that bit in the face
<br /><br />In the middle of the film, a five-man singing group called the "Landmines" takes the stage at an officers' ball
Okay- are you ready? The joke is THEY SING TERRIBLY AND OFF-KEY
Why did I write that in caps also? Because the joke is POUND, POUND, POUNDED INTO YOUR HEAD with a marathon of HORRENDOUS sight gags
They start off mediocre enough; glasses cracking, punch tumblers shattering
then there is, I am 100% serious, a two-frame stop-motion sequence of A WOMAN'S SHOES COMING OFF
You read that correctly- the music was so bad, in one frame, the woman's feet have shoes on
In the very next- the shoes are off!!! Get it, because the music was so bad, her shoes came off! What the F???? <br /><br />Then there is an endless montage of stock footage to drive home the point that the SINGING IS BAD
If any human being actually suffered through this scene in the theater without running like hell, I would be astonished
This movie is honestly like a practical joke to see how fast people would bolt out the doors
directs comedy the way his son commands respect by staying drug-free
Other things to watch out for:<br /><br />1
The popular music shoehorned in wherever possible
Every time Liceman appears, a really inappropriate Iggy Pop song plays
Plus all the actors do their best to act like it got really chilly for some reason
She sounds like she's trying to talk like a baby while rolling a marble around on her tongue
There is no nudity, and there are several scenes where the boys all moan and writhe from a glimpse of her cleavage, like they're in a community school acting class and they've been directed to act like aroused retarded people
Remember; when this movie came out throwing in "abortion" and "condom" was seen as "edgy"
Tom Poston plays a mincing, boy-hungry pedophile, back when Hollywood thought "pedophile" and "homosexual" were one in the same
Tell me that doesn't make you want to explode everyone who's ever made any movie, ever
Up The Academy has been known to actually make other movies, like The Jerk or Blazing Saddles, less funny simply by placing the videotape near them
<br /><br />They didn't develop any of the characters at all and the storyline was played out horribly
You'd expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strong points but D-Wars surprises you with even a let down in that department
<br /><br />Also, the acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porno flick
<br /><br />I was actually happy to see the end credits on this one cause it was just that bad!!! Please, whatever you do people, don't waste your time and money on a crappy movie like D-Wars
Yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre
About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie, she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life
Why are they crappy, for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act
I mean we watch porn for the sex do we not
Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but it is still very erotic and nice to look at
Of course the girls in that one are very cute
Here we have a rather unattractive lead actress and that does not help things
If you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vision that is going to make me enjoy the film
The sex scenes range from yuck to bizarre
I mean there is a snake in one of them people
So for me this movie just fails as it does not excite me at all, but rather turns me off
This movie is so bad it's good -- in an unintentionally funny way
I couldn't stop watching it, I was laughing so much! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except it's not a parody
<br /><br />Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, an oppressed preacher's wife who falls hard for Luke (Corey Sevier), a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison; the only thing Sevier is guilty of, though, is bad acting! Mind you, he's no worse than the other actors
You get the sense that the actors have *no* idea they're in a really awful film; they're playing it straight
Everything about the film is bad: the acting, the script, the love scenes, the pacing, the plot twists, the choice of music
The climactic scenes are just so ludicrous -- first the shootout in the church, then Luke's final words to Emily -- I was howling with laughter
<br /><br />Evidently Luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison, and we get to see plenty of his naked torso
That's probably the highlight of the film
This movie is now my gauge against which all other movies will be compared
as in, "was it as stupid as Revolver?" I too was in the Toronto International Film Festival audience last night where a room filled with over 2000 people walked out in an eerie silence after being absolutely dumbstruck by 2 hours of sheer nonsense
Jason Stratham would have been amazing if only he had a purpose
Within the first 10 minutes he's given a proposition by Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (of Soprano's fame) which makes NO SENSE AT ALL! Then there's some shooting and then there's Ray Liotta wearing embarrassing bikini briefs, then there's some animation, Ray Liotta's naked butt, lots of shooting, teeth gnashing, art house wanna be pretensions and more of Liotta's embarrassing body that elicited laughs at every showing
which I'm not quite sure was the reaction he was looking for
Everyone in this movie thinks they're smarter than the average bear and Guy Ritchie thinks he's Yogi Bear incarnate
The story lines might have went nowhere but the posturing was outta sight! The only way this movie could have been worse is if Madonna herself was in it
The idea of In the Name of the People is good, a murderer doesn't want his only daughter to end up in an institution and asks the parents of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter
And you could expect of the actors, especially Scott Bakula to do some good acting, unfortunately they don't! In the Name of The People turns out to be the regular Friday night tearjerker
The flashbacks with the girl that was killed are pretty pathetic and at a certain stage you can just predict what the actors will say
If you want to watch a good film about this subject then watch Dean Man Walking
If you can make it thru "classic Meyer" titles/intro, you can wade thru anything
But would you want to? I did not find a lot there to dig my teeth into
I suppose if you go into it with low enuff expectations you will be delighted (a la Charlie's Angels
) But for my money I'd like a little something more, more visual, more moving
I feel like I'm begging for gruel @ the foot of the master
Ridiculous horror film about a wealthy man (John Carradine) dying and leaving everything to his four children, and his servants to be divided up equally
One condition--they must spend one week in his estate to get the money
And if any of them die, the others get more
<br /><br />I saw a brand new print of this film on cable
The colors were bright and vivid and the house itself looks beautiful
That's about all the good things I can say about it
<br /><br />Let's list just some of the problems this film has: the killer is screamingly obvious; the servants are called Igor and Elga--come on!; some of the sound recording was so bad I couldn't make out the dialogue (no great loss I'm sure); the gore was sparse and very poorly done; the other murders were simply boring, stupid or impossible and this movie contains some truly abominable acting--so bad you just stare at the screen in disbelief
Even pro Jeff Morrow was terrible! The only fairly good acting was from trouper Faith Domergue (who deserved better than this) and John Carradine (who looks painfully old and frail here)
I do have to admit though--the closing line in this movie is a gem!<br /><br />Why this was renamed "Legacy of Blood" is beyond me--there's another 1978 horror film with that name!<br /><br />Whatever its name is, it's a bad movie
This movie made me feel as if I had missed some important scenes from the very beginning
There were continuity errors and plots that stopped as abruptly as they started
I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg & Danny Glover, in addition to that have always trusted & respected Danny Glovers taste in his choice of roles, "Grand Canyon" for example
I just could not finish this movie, after what seemed an eternity, but was probably just a little over an hour; we had to turn it off
There was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them, there was no evoking of emotion at all regarding this movie and the clips of their past were poorly edited, confusing, and unnecessary
What could have been a great idea for a movie, even as a drama & not a comedy (although I think a comedy in this situation would have been better, because I love to watch white people freak out & start acting like complete idiots, it makes me laugh) became a waste of my $1 credit at the video store
I got myself a copy of this film thinking it was the 1964 film with 'Zombie Bloodbath' as one of it's alternative titles
Perversely, this film actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title; which may mean that the other one is really bad! This film is pretty bad too; obviously you cant go into a film that calls itself 'Zombie Bloodbath' and expect to see a masterpiece, and in fairness it does live up to the title with the amount of gore on display
but it all feels very old and tired, which isn't helped by the atrocious acting and stupid plot line
It's just your average nuclear spill causing people to turn into zombies etc etc
The film kicks off with a sequence that sees people melting and that pretty much lets you know what you're in for; low quality zombie garbage
There's plenty of gore in the film, and it's a real good job otherwise the film would have been really boring
Zombie Bloodbath looks really cheap too, and was clearly put together by inexperienced filmmakers! The main influence seemed to be Romero's superior Day of the Dead, although it could really be just about anything that features zombies and gore
It all boils down to a typically predictable and pointless ending and overall I can't say I was impressed with it
I will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about, to prevent it from happening again
I agree with the comments from the gentleman from UK
Historical and technical inaccuracies abound
Look up the technical specs on DE 529, or any Everts class Destroyer Escort, and you will see what I mean
I now its black history month in the US, and Im going to be called a racist just for saying this, but the history of this ship is not that great
They did some escort work, chased a "submarine" that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed
Sorry, but black people did a lot more in WWII then this silly movie gives them credit for
Let the name calling commence, I can handle it
This movie barely followed the story line of the movie
All of the fascinating points in the book didn't even exist in the movie
They ended up turning it into a cheesy "tween" Disney movie "crush" story between Meg and Calvin
It was so bad it should have been Hillary Duff playing the part, or one of the likes
This movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book
I can't believe Disney could even get away with making such a cheap, basic rendition
If you've ever read the book, I think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of "Lord of the Rings" equivalence
This movie should have never been able to use the title of A Wrinkle in Time
What a stinkeroo this turned out to be!!! At one time, much earlier in her career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - no great shakes as an Actress, but very beautiful and pleasant (particularly in films like "The Mark of Zorro" and "Blood and Sand") but when I saw this monstrosity, the memories of her golden days faded quickly
The story is unbelievable and farcical, the acting second-rate, the supporting cast insufferable
I cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked
Added to this, was the terrible photography (and I am not just referring to the color!) Everyone associated with this, must have shuddered whenever it was shown
This really was the worst movie I have ever seen
Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And she looks absolutely awful through the whole movie, the hair is so bad! They talk in like monotone voices and there is nooo chemistry
The cover of the DVD does not even remotely come close to what the movie actually is
I had to fast forward through some of it because it was so painful to watch
I really want to know how i on earth anyone could think this is good? hhaha they literally just like talk and say "yeah" and there is no passion whatsoever
I could not tell at all that they were in love
I'm sorry but this was the saddest excuse for a movie I think I have ever seen
An old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies
You get your Hitchcock, your Chaplin, your Bergman and some other stuff prior to the 80ies
To disguise that he has no clue what is going on in cinemas these days, he throws in The Matrix
<br /><br />But it's not only the same lame film-as-art speech all over again
This speech is reduced to outdated psychological platitudes: it-ego-super ego, anal phase, sexual insufficiency
<br /><br />It is garnished with the cheesy effect of having Zizte edited into the movies he is taking about
For someone who is supposed to know much about movies, his own is, cinematographicly speaking: yeiks
<br /><br />To put it in Zizek's own words - I saw 5\-\!7 on the screen, last night, or in the words of a great movie maker:<br /><br />Mr
(Zizek), what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard
At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought
Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it
I award you (two) points (only), and may God have mercy on your soul
<br /><br />What an exciting plot! A terrorist places bombs on a train
How could the writers and producers of this stinker turn this into such a dull story?<br /><br />Glenn Ford, as the expert called upon to defuse the bomb, is given awful writing material to work with
Naturally, just as he is called in, his wife, Anne Vernon, is about to leave him
After such a film, it would be enough to end her career
<br /><br />That elderly man who loved trains and interferes is our 1953 version of senile dementia
I thought it was highly insulting to show this man, even at the end
A noble effort, I guess, but ultimately a poor one
Before seeing this film, I felt "Bartleby, The Scrivener" was unfilmable
Unfortunately, I think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on, and they will be upset at the film's needless revisions (updating from 1850 to 1970, moving from New York to London)
Even the superb talents of Paul Scofield can't salvage what looks to me like a well meaning but misguided effort to film Melville's metaphysical classic
Painful is the only word to describe this awful rendition of such a fun and interesting Shakespearean play
I gave it a shot but was terribly disappointed and couldn't bare to even finish viewing it
To the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this twist of Much Ado was, I pity you and your bored brain
May your pretenses about young viewers be lifted without retribution
Please do not even bother with this gut wrenching, disgusting excuse for a performance of an acclaimed Shakespeare drama
You will be forced to induce vomiting and will require a commode close to the television with which you choose to watch this crap because involuntary defecation will take place
May the saints preserve us, because this movie is not going to help
<br /><br />Someone with access needs to e-mail Mel Gibson and tell him we need a faithful production of Beowulf
Something that actually has something in common with the epic poem that is the foundation for all modern western literature
<br /><br />The recent (since 2000) versions of Beowulf make we wonder two things
First, why is there so much interest in the story
Second, why are all these filmmakers squandering mountains of cash on this crap
<br /><br />The only reason this got a two is that the version with Lambert in it (Beowulf 2000) was worse and needed the 1
<br /><br />What is even worse, some people will watch this and get the wrong idea about the poem
How can an industry where Peter Jackson gets a literary conversion to film so right can get it so wrong
I mean really, the Roman Forum as a model for Heorot is too much
<br /><br />And PLEASE, horns on helmets? Spare me
It's quite accurate copy bringing nothing new to the story
Basinger is weak - without good directing
Baldwin is simply just a second league compared to McQueen
I watched it just out of curiosity, being a huge fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and I got what I thought
Almost a B movie with second rate acting and directing
I wasn't even disappointed, I just don't know what they were trying to do
This remake doesn't try to play with the original material, it's not a tribute and indeed it lacks some really good actor of its era
<br /><br />It reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful photograph
<br /><br />This is a complete waste of your time
Save yourself 2 hours or watch the original (again:))
A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series and the worst sequel ever in the series, even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2
I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD box set for my birthday and I watched all the sequels
The dream child was the worst without a doubt, I was surprised too since they were doing so well with the last two sequels
But I guess they just lost the charm, the story was just ridicules and I wasn't happy with where it went
Alice just became more annoying, she's not Nancy or Kirsten, so her carrying this film on her own didn't work for me
Freddy is also loosing his scare, this was just getting a bit silly
<br /><br />Alice is back and she's carrying a child, she couldn't be happier with her life
But Freddy is also back and he's not going to be too light on her since she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie
But anyways, he wants her child and to be born into the world again
Did you ever wonder if Freddy had parents too? Well that's what A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child investigates and Alice soon finds out what Freddy's childhood was like and that maybe that's the one thing that can defeat him
<br /><br />A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child is just all in all a bad movie and an insult to the series
I don't think anyone could be happy with this sequel
Just the story was really silly, I mean it could have possibly worked, but once again, it was just executed the wrong way
I know that if you're looking to see the sequels for the Nightmare on Elm Street series, you should watch it, but I really wouldn't recommend it, it's not worth it, at least in my opinion
This sequel is a total rehash of the first film
It basically just took every single sceanrio of the first film and they redid it in Omen IV except with a female antichrist this time
It even ends the same way as the first one! The music is too busy and interfering, and because its pretty much a copy of Omen I, it's extremely predictable
It's not a horrible movie, it's not terribly made, there is much worse movies out there, this just had absolutely no point in being made
The Omen remake from 2006 is much worse, even more pointless than this, so I guess it has that
If you someone pointed a gun to your head and you had to choose to watch this sequel or the 2006 reamke, I guess I'd choose this
Tourists head to Ireland for a school trip to learn about Druids
What they encounter is a horrific tale of cannibalistic killers
<br /><br />If I had to sum up Evil Breed, it would be a low grade gore fest
The film mixes Dead Alive, Evil Dead, Wrong Turn all in one
It's just too bad that the film has so many inconsistencies to keep track of that it loses any "fun" one would have watching it
The film has lots of random "horror" nudity
although the film also stars four porn stars, yup four, so there could have been plenty more
Breed also showcases a good amount of gore
<br /><br />Evil Breed has a horrible start, with laughable dialogue and horrible acting
That's a given in a straight to video horror film, but this takes the cake
I can't really figure out who the main character is, since the one female who "lives" at the end is not really in the movie all that much
Speaking of the ending, that has to be one of the most random and bogus ending in the history of film
It has no purpose with the rest of the film and totally changes one's view of the film
<br /><br />You have to see this film to believe it, since there are some pretty great death scenes
There are two death scenes that come into my mind, one in which the inbred killer rips the intestines out of a naked woman through her chest
The other id when the guy gets his intestines, yet again, ripped out through his asshole
Does that kill the guy? No, the killer continues to strangle the guy with his own intestines
These scenes remind me so much of Dead-Alive, with the right amount of humour in each
I also got the sense of Evil Dead, with the pointless mentions of horror films and Sam Raimi
Along with Halloween, when the female character is in a closet screaming for her life with the killer trying desperately;y to get in
<br /><br />Although, the gore and nudity are not enough for the poor audio and visual quality of the film
When the teacher wakes up from her bed and walks down the stairs, her footsteps are so loud and hard that it seems like she was wearing boots
As well as the continuity in the film, with only one inbred killer? As well as which character dies at which moment
I couldn't tell if the breast implant chick was Jenny or Gary's sister/cousin
As well as the random naked chick with a dead baby hanging out of her body, still attached with the umbilical cord
<br /><br />The horrible editing is distracting as well, the opening credits are too fast and disorienting
It did have a bad start and got better, but the ending just brings the film back down to a horrible level
If maybe there were better production values and more faith put into this film, then it wouldn't have been horribly butchered to death
Stay away from this film, unless you are happy with the below budget horrible bad film with decent gore
Nu Image, UFO and others produce films for the SCI FI channel that come in with budgets of roughly $2 million
Some feature extensive effects work, others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both -- for $2 million
Hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $20 million dollars but it's painfully obvious that this was probably produced for $750,000 if not considerably less than that
Few sets are utilized, a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish
Not so much because it is poorly directed, poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget
<br /><br />Those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by P
I love Zombie-Movies and I love amateur-productions
And Meat Market 2 starts really promising with a nice homage to Fulci´s Classic "Zombi"
<br /><br />So I leaned back and waited to be impressed
Okay, some of the makeups are great for such a no budget movie and some actors (the vampirelady and the cook) really stand out, but else there´s nothing
<br /><br />I didn´t expect a new Romero here but there is not one sequence in the whole movie which has even a little bit of suspense or shock value
The director sure knows how to stage body rippings and interesting eating habits, but now (after two parts) it´s time to learn something more
<br /><br />In MeatMarket2 Gore rhymes with bore - for me that´s not enough - sorry
Mr Perlman gives a standout performance (as usual)
Sadly, he has to struggle with an underwritten script and some nonsensical set pieces
<br /><br />Larsen is in "Die Hard" mode complete with singlet and bulging muscles, I'm sure he could do better but seems satisfied to grimace and snarl through his part
<br /><br />The lovely Erika is very decorative (even though fully clothed!) and shows some signs of "getting" acting at last
<br /><br />SFX are mainly poor CGI and steals from other movies
<br /><br />The shootouts are pitiful - worthy of the A-Team<br /><br />Not even worth seeing for Perlman - AVOI
This is a total thrash in terms of acting, directing, sound editing, soundtrack
There was such a waste of performance by some of the very good actors
The movie does not do justice to Paresh Rawal who is perhaps one of the most talented actors in Bollywood
Akshay Kumar who is also an emerging star did quite a poor job
John Abraham, what is wrong with him? Is that what you call acting? I mean he should thank God that he has a pretty face otherwise he'd be winning Razzie awards in India if there were any such awards in Bollywood
Asrani a great talent, but overdoes his bit as before
<br /><br />Screenplay which was not to mention a rip-off from the 1965's Boeing Boeing was quite badly framed
First of all, people in Bollywood just can't make something original
On top of that they don't even know how to copy well
The jokes in the movie were so overdone, it was getting painful to sit through them
Priyadarshan may be a star in the south, but he's just not fit to make a decent Hindi movie
I can go on and on this matter, but the bottom-line is that Bollywood should be shameful of making such a film
<br /><br />The worst part is that some people seemed to love this movie
What is wrong with you guys? This is the reason why Bollywood is where it is
Did you know that Bollywood makes more movies than Hollywood every year, however, most of the movies are unheard of abroad, because of movies like this one
I am an Indian and I am utterly shameful of Bollywood for producing this piece of thrash
Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were just terrific
They are world class films which are timeless
Garam Masala, however, is perhaps one of the worst of this century
I will probably always go to see a Woody Alleb movie, as one never knows when he just might make a real return to his past greatness
Just one or two great moments or lines could make it worthwhile
sadly however this film just does'nt make it on any score
Saying thar actually makes me sad and even a little guilty
I'm sure my reaction is much like a lot of other fans of Woody, but what can one say? It's probably time for him to concentrate on his Clarinett, which in my opinion, he is rather quite good
Saying all of this, I'll still probably go to any new film Woody may come out with in the future
There's always hope and I'll continue to love and respect The WOODY!
I'm a great admirer of Lon Chaney, but the screen writing of this movie just did not work for me
The story jumps around oddly (I've since learned that the film is missing a section), and characters appear and disappear with irritating suddenness
Some of the intertitles are overly explanatory (e
, "why, you're not a child anymore!"--cut back to picture for a long, slow beat--"you're a woman!" yes, we got it the first time) but there are a few talking sequences that beg for explanations that never appear
(Let's hear Luigi and his blond girlfriend's argument, please!) The plot, which involves incestuous desires (figuratively if not technically) was disturbing to the point that it was hard to watch
To the writer's credit, this issue was treated as a problem, and a May-December match is not portrayed as the right-and-good inevitability of some Mary Pickford films (e
Chaney gives a good performance, as usual, but I think he has been better-directed in the past--he overdid it a few times here, IMHO
I did enjoy the clown sequences, and was very impressed at the stunts
Loretta Young was charming, though astonishingly young
The film has its moments, but so far, it's my least-favorite Chaney picture
I foolishly read the back of the DVD cover of this movie in Best Buy about a year ago, and said to myself, "Seems funny, plus it has Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose!" I proceeded to pay $15
I took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted
All the "hilarious" and "outstanding" performances promised never seemed to arrive
After 90 minutes I hung my head in shame, knowing that I could never get that 90 minutes or $15
I literally almost cried as well, because if that was what could be considered "comedy" I didn't want to believe in movies anymore
My friend and I constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was
Over the holiday season this year I watched it with him because he didn't want to watch it alone
This was my next horrible mistake, because as I watched I just became angry
I began to yell at the movie, and I'm not one to talk to movies period
Everyone I know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they've ever seen
My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends, but that could not save this movie even
The fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on IMDb is astounding
The fact that its rating (at the time of this writing) is 3
I had read a few positive reviews of this film, and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was
Positioned as some cross between an AIDS-related story and some kind of "Ghost"/"Blithe Spirit" tale, this film can't always make it's mind up what it wants to be
<br /><br />Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have an "open" relationship - Simon is able to have anonymous (though safe) sex on the side when he wants
Mark is HIV+ and he and Simon don't seem to have a sex life anymore
When Mark dies, Simon - who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father - tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor
Not that his behavior before Mark's death was much different
But Mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts, while getting Simon to open up and admit his true feelings
<br /><br />Unfortunately, Simon is such a selfish SOB, it's impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film
By the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic, it's too late to care
Mark, on the other hand, follows in Demi Moore's footsteps from "Ghost," by crying profusely throughout the movie
<br /><br />There is a bizarre switch in tone after Mark returns
Suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor, a la the TV show "Bewitched
Once Simon's emotional health is at stake, the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish, with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings
The finale, with a gold-plated muscle-boy angel guiding a tearful Mark to heaven while a chastened, grief-stricken Simon waves goodbye is just stupefying, chiefly because it isn't intentionally funny
Quite possibly the nicest woman in show business, and the sexiest, Debbie gives another fine performance here
Although her work in American Nightmare was far superior, she is still worth watching in this film
<br /><br />The cast is filled with your typical Melrose Place types, chiseled features and seductive curves, that I had never seen before
Other than Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actress I had seen before, in the similar Delta Delta Die
<br /><br />The plot centers around a group of California arrogants who initiate poor naive Debbie Rochon into their clique
They tell her that they have a murder club, and that she must kill someone to be accepted
Debbie wants nothing more but to be accepted by these cool people, so she quickly kills a person, and now the group must decide what to do with her, after she fell for their joke
<br /><br />VIOLENCE: $$$$$ (Plentiful! Debbie Rochon occasionally has blood splattered all over her and all of the murder scenes are done in your face
Gore hounds will surely enjoy!)<br /><br />NUDITY: $$$$$ (Plentiful as well! Debbie Rochon has several nude scenes as do many of the no-name actresses and actors
The pool party seems as just an excuse to get everyone naked; man and woman alike
Julie Strain also has a topless cameo but her character is gone after the first five minutes)
<br /><br />STORY: $$ (Could have received a higher vote because the plot was very interesting and unique but the plot serves as filler between nude scenes
I understand that B-Rate films use nudity often, but this is borderline excessive)
<br /><br />ACTING: $ (The acting is sub standard to say the least
Rochon is always a treat, easily the best B-Rate actress in the business today, but her character in American Nightmare was superior
Danny Wolske does a fine job as Debbie's object of lust but the other actors were nothing to write about)
An uptight voyeur who wants to commit suicide encounters a free spirited bad-seed who has 5 weeks to live and then they're off to discover America
Get the idea? There's not an original moment in this whole movie
So let me start off by saying that I saw this movie as part of a bargain
I was really bored one fine 1997 day and so I biked over to the movie rental store
I asked the clerk what the worst movie he had in stock was
Without hesitation he walked me over to "Lucky Stiff
" He told me that he'd waive the $1 rental fee (he said it would be wrong to charge more) if I promised to watch the whole movie
I don't need to go into plot details, read the other reviews
I know it was supposed to be a comedy, but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting
You might try to watch it as something to laugh at, but it's so bad that it isn't even funny in that way
Everybody knows that Gregory Widen's original "The Prophecy" didn't really require a sequel, but you also don't need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cash-ins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable
Part two is a very prototypic example of a straight-to-video sequel, meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action, more witty one-liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery
The only good news is that the producers managed to keep Christopher Walken for the role of Gabriel, and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental
If it wasn't for Walken's performance (and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like Brittany Murphy and Glenn Danzig), "The Prophecy II" surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release
The movie begins with Gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing War of Heaven here on earth
The purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse Valerie Rosales (Jennifer Beals) from getting born
For you see, her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly "monkey" and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of Gabriel's evil dominion
Thus, just as in the first movie, he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts Valerie all the way down to the Eden for the final showdown
"The Prophecy II" is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you don't make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity
Whenever the storyline becomes too tedious, the makers luckily enough always insert a near-brilliant Christopher Walken moment to distract you
His interactions with the rebellious Izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences
On a slightly off-topic note, I often felt like "The Prophecy II" ambitions to look similar to "Terminator II"  Gabriel's resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the Eden location, where the final battle takes place, looks very similar to the steel factory where "Terminator II" ended as well
Coincidence, I guess? Overall, this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case you're a fan of Christopher Walken's unique acting charisma (and who isn't?)
I was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it received, but after viewing it I was terribly disappointed
Slums is a totally unfunny film mixed with a Todd Solondz type of disturbing family reality sans Todd's brand of humor
The story drags along and each scene is worse than the last
Maybe I missed the point, but if this film is an example of every girl's growing up experience I am glad to be a man
Thanks to some infamous home video distributor who brought in the so called German Independent Series, Four For Venice is not only awful, but really awful
So awful, that i have it dumped at the second hand goods store for extra cash
<br /><br />Nick and Charlotte is a married couple who reached an agreement of having sex only on Tuesday due to their hectic schedule of their profession
Eva and Luis is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and Luis, an artist
Nick indirectly causes Eva to lose her job as an waitress
Luis and Charlotte had an affair at the back of Eva and Nick
Luis cheated on Eva by lying to her that he would be flying off to London to do something related to his artwork, but the fact is, he is flying off to Venice with Charlotte for an adultery holiday
Eva kidnapped Nick and dragged her 2 kids along to Venice for confrontation
The trip to Venice ends up both Nick and Eva falling for one another
<br /><br />The presentation of the journey from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva marks the failure of the comedy
It not only look senseless, but also draggy
In the film, Nick try to seek help for several ways, but it ends to no avail
It is either the strangers around him who acts like morons, or they are just simply dumb
<br /><br />The comedy also had the tendency to add in unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story
While some of the problems that can be solved with common sense, no one in the film are using common sense to solve the problem
They prefer to go through one big round to solve the problem
<br /><br />It fails so bad, that even the beautiful sceneries in Venice fails to pull up the reputation of the film
foywonder's review of this cheap STV hits the nail squarely on the head
In case you don't, a group of scientists heads off into the deep woods of the Pacific Northwest, to fumble around with a bunch of bones in an animal graveyard
The Big Foot family doesn't take kindly to this, and proceeds to pick off the team one by one, largely offscreen
Big Foot himself has a distinctly ape-like face, but is less scary overall than Harry from HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS
Most of the movie has the wooden, generic actors pretending to be scientists tromping around in the woods and yakking away
This is a no-budget movie in which very little happens, at least on screen
We do get to watch the sexiest of the females take a shower while one of her male companions watches, but nothing comes of this
Generally, I've found that if you don't hear about a movie prior to seeing it on DVD, there's probably a good reason for it
I hadn't heard about this movie at all until I was in a Blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf
Since all the good movies had already been rented out (the ones I wanted to see, anyway), I figured I'd give this one a shot
<br /><br />It's really not much different than other movies in the genre, such as The Singles Ward or the R
If you're into those type movies, you'll probably enjoy this
<br /><br />However, if you're not a mormon, this movie probably won't appeal to you
There's no way to avoid the overtly religious (mormon) message contained within, and at times it comes across as sappy and cheesy
Ultimately, if you don't fall within the mormon demographic, you're probably better off watching something else
<br /><br />Admittedly, there were some very funny moments in the film, but I didn't think that it was enough to salvage the movie overall
I'd heard it was the best ever filmed of the novel
<br /><br />How any true Jane Austen fan can rate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes
The scriptwriters have decided to stick in bits of ridiculous humour which are embarrassing at the best of times, but also ruin the feel of the period
As for the cast: Gwyneth Paltrow makes a rather shallow heroine (but then any 'hot' American star would be questionable in the role), Toni Collette is miscast, and poor Ewan McGregor is made to look laughable!<br /><br />I really could not say a good thing about this film
I seem to be among the very few who don't rate it, but if you want my advice, see instead the TV production starring Kate Beckinsale - believe me, that is far preferable to this superficial trash
If you rent a movie titled "Exterminators of the year 3000," the odds are good you know what you're getting yourself into
I myself was sold by the promising descriptions of "nuke mutants," "motor-psychos," and of course the "exterminators" themselves which, according to the back of the movie-store case, are all cavorting around a post-apocalyptic barren wasteland wreaking all sorts of mayhem
Let the wacky hijinks and low budget buffoonery ensue--at least, such were my hopes for this "film
"<br /><br />Now I like the occasional terrible movie, and if you're reading the comments on Exterminators of the Year 3000, you probably do too
That being said, I rated this film a solid "1(awful)"--not because I completely hated the film but because it is one of the most legitimately dreadful efforts at movie-making I have ever seen
The dialogue, the acting, the cinematography, the sound-editing, the editing in general, the plot, etc
, etc--all are worthy of what must surely be low spectator expectations given that marvelous title
<br /><br />So what is really "good" about this bad movie? It does have several of what my circle affectionately terms "quality kills
" A quality kill, for those few of you unfamiliar with the phrase, isn't a hard and fast term, but in general refers to someone killed in a particularly gruesome, creative, or ridiculous fashion
<br /><br />Exterminators of the Year 3000 also has a fair supply of "dialogue-so-bad-it-becomes-funny," provided in great part by Crazy Bull, the aptly titled leader of the hapless motor-psycho gang--who incidentally also provide most of the quality kills (if you're hoping for big things from the nuke mutants, think again, they play essentially zero part in the movie
Crazy Bull, however, is all you could ask for in a b-movie motor-psycho
Shakespearean paraphrase and oddly PG-style insults are all he knows how to say
<br /><br />Despite its quality kills and bad dialogue, however, if you're looking for a truly entertaining bad movie, Exterminators of the Year 3000 does disappoint somewhat in that with its draw limited to things like silly and outdated special effects, quality killing, and bad dialogue, there is simply not enough to justify a full feature length, owing principally to the forty minutes or so in which the audience is forced to follow the characters in protracted and boring car "chases" and long desert hiking sequences
All in all, a pretty good awful movie, but hey, it's no Death Race 2000
How low can someone sink while trying to recapture an old glory? ST:HF will be glad to show you
<br /><br />If you are used to seeing what made for a good Star Trek show, do NOT watch this
<br /><br />The writing is hodge-podge, the actors' portrayals of their characters weak, and most of all, the design work is downright doggy
<br /><br />Like watching strong captains, don't look here! Like the strong Federation attitude? Forget about it here! Starfleet is mocked by ensigns wearing SPIKES in their hair
<br /><br />While a seemingly mentally feeble captain shuffles about and within two minutes of the opening show's credits, Ensign Spikey is attempting to arrange a tryst with an engineer
No, not even uniforms match, for goodness sake
They are too small or too big, collars down to their chests, and TNG Seasons One and Two Uniforms mixed in with Season Three and DS9 uniforms
The strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals in lacking in this production down to the treads! The only good thing about this show is its graphics, which seem to improve a bit with each season
Who uses CG that inexpertly? The designers of this show
<br /><br />Don't bother with it, it will offend your Star Trek sense, as it did mine
Not even the throw backs to previous shows can save this catastrophe
<br /><br />I wept openly when i watched this, probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost ruptured
***SLIGHT SPOILERS***<br /><br />A hunchback 15-year-old boy kisses a very cute 15-year-old girl and eventually he has sex for the first time
After the act, he lays in the bed with her not touching her
The next day he concludes that he does not like sex much and does not want to try it again for at least a few years
<br /><br />This is seemingly a fine opening for a teleplay about a boy discovering his homosexuality, or perhaps a medical drama about a post-pubescent teen with a severe hormone deficiency
<br /><br />However, as the plot develops what emerges is a story of a 15-year-old father who is supported and encouraged by his overbearing mother
<br /><br />At one point, his mother preaches to her co-workers who are not as understanding as they might be, "Every step of the way in this, my son has been amazing
"<br /><br />The young father's older sister, who otherwise is cold towards her brother, begins to show pride in her sibling, "You have been cool about this," as she gives him an encouraging warm hug
<br /><br />The 15-year-old father wants to be a father
<br /><br />Why not? We see the "new" baby a few minutes after birth -- it appears to be a healthy, happy 4-month-old infant
Just as babies were born on TV in the 1960's and 1970's
<br /><br />Once the young father is a parent, he has found happiness
He insists he will be the one to change the dirty diaper
We see the 15-year-old father sincerely happy holding his baby while the teen's busy=body mother is peaking over his shoulder
A worn-out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case + the equally worn-out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut out
<br /><br />With such an outstanding case, one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins
But scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity, no character arcs, and inexplicable behavior
<br /><br />The homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary -- or on the other hand, completely unexplored
It seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers
When will Hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picture?<br /><br />A regrettably dreadful movie
When will Lauren Bacall pick a good one? I expected better of her and Kristin Scott Thomas
I could give you a plot summary, or some hoity toity analysis, but I would consider it a waste of your time
All anybody needs to know about this movie is two young sisters, one incestuous relationship, homicide, post mortem mutilation, and one really disturbing infatuation
At the end of the movie you feel like you need to go take a shower to wash the filth off yourself, but not in a good way like after "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club"
It's like you're a teenager (or high schooler being that i am myself still a teenager)and have just done something you A: wish you hadn't done, and B: hope to the Good Lord of Heaven and Earth that your parents never find out about
My advise is that rather than defiling your mind and by watching piece of wanton cinematic filth, just go waste your time on something a little less horrible and watch "Kazaam"(yes, I would rather watch "Kazaam" than "Murderous Maids", read into it what you want)
Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view
The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too exaggerated
Anyway, the movie seems not to have a lot of artistic ambitions
<br /><br />Instead, I think this is a straight commercial thing
Including a character from the french part of Switzerland (the actor IS the leader of the band he is touring with in the movie - the band's called SENS UNIK) seems to aim to a larger audience
A straight German-swiss movie would not have sold in the french part - and vice versa
What really got on my nerves were the product placements all over the movie
Sometines scenes remembered of advertisement clips! <br /><br />I also think the topic of "young people taking drugs without any other targets in their lives" is a wide spread reality in Zurich
Therefore, it should be elaborated with more care
I hope Samir got enough money with Snow White, in order that his next movie is gonna show his true artistic skills
Seldom seen since theatrical release in 1970, MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has become a byword for cinematic debacles of legendary proportions
Now at last on DVD in an unexpectedly handsome package, it is as unlikely to win wide audiences today as it was when first released
<br /><br />Gore Vidal's 1968 bestseller was a darkly satirical statement
Most filmmakers felt that the novel's story, structure, and overall tone would not translate to film, and industry insiders were surprised when 20th Century Fox not only acquired the rights but also hired Vidal to adapt his novel to the screen
But studio executives soon had cold feet: Vidal's adaptations were repeatedly rejected and novice writer-director Michael Sarne was brought in to bring the film to the screen
<br /><br />Studio executives hoped that Sarne would tap into the youth market they saw as a target for the film, but Sarne proved even more out of synch with the material than the executives themselves
The cast, sensing disaster, became increasingly combative
In her DVD commentary, star Raquel Welch says that she seldom had any idea of what Myra's motives were from scene to scene or even within any single scene itself, and that each person involved seemed to be making an entirely different film
In the accompanying "Back Story" documentary, Rex Reed says that MYRA BRECKINRIDGE was a film made by a bunch of people who hid in their dressing rooms while waiting for their lawyers to return their calls
<br /><br />The accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself
The basics of Vidal's story are there, but not only has the story been shorn of all broader implications, it seems to have no point in and of itself
Everything runs off in multiple directions, nothing connects, and numerous scenes undercut whatever logic previous scenes might have had
And while director Sarne repeatedly states in his commentary that he wanted to make the film as pure farce, the only laughs generated are accidental
<br /><br />Chief among these accidents is Mae West
It is true that West is unexpectedly well preserved in appearance and that she had lost none of her way with a one-liner--but there is no getting around the fact that she is in her seventies, and her conviction that she is the still the sexiest trick in shoe leather is extremely unsettling, to say the least
But worse, really, is the fact that West is outside her era
Her efforts to translate herself into a hip and happening persona results in one of the most embarrassing self-caricatures ever seen on film
<br /><br />The remaining cast is largely wasted
Raquel Welch, a significantly underestimated actress, plays the title role of Myra very much like a Barbie doll on steroids; non-actor Rex Reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of Myron, but the entire role is essentially without point
Only John Huston and cameo players John Carradine, Jim Backus, William Hopper, and Andy Devine emerge relatively unscathed
Yes, it really is the debacle everyone involved in the film feared it would be: fast when it should be slow, slow when it should be fast, relentlessly unfunny from start to finish
It is true that director Sarne does have the occasional inspired idea--as in his use of film clips of everyone from Shirley Temple to Judy Garland to create counterpoint to the action--but by and large, whenever Sarne was presented with a choice of how to do something he seems to have made the wrong one
<br /><br />The how and why of that is made clear in Sarne's audio commentary
Sarne did not like the novel or, for that matter, the subject matter in general
He did not want to write the screenplay, but he needed the money; he emphatically did not want to direct the film, but he need the money
He makes it very clear that he disliked author Gore Vidal and Rex Reed (at one point he flatly states that Reed "is not a nice person"), and to this day he considers that Vidal and Reed worked in tandem to sabotage the film because he refused to play into their 'homosexual agenda'--which, when you come right down to it, seems to have been their desire that Sarne actually film Vidal's novel rather than his own weirdly imagined take-off on it
<br /><br />Although he spends a fair amount of commentary time stating that the film is widely liked by the gay community, Sarne never quite seems to understand that the appeal of the film for a gay audience arises from his ridiculously inaccurate depiction of homosexual people
When taken in tandem with the film itself, Sarne emerges as more than a little homophobic--and quite frankly the single worst choice of writers and directors that could have been made for this project
<br /><br />In addition to the Sarne and Welch commentaries and the making-of documentary, the DVD release includes several trailers and two versions of the film: a "theatrical release" version and a "restored" version
The only difference between the two is that the final scene in the "restored" version has been printed to black and white
The edits made before the film went into general release have not been restored, but the documentary details what they were
The widescreen transfers of both are remarkably good and the sound is quite fine
But to end where I began, this is indeed a film that will most interest film historians, movie buffs, and cult movie fans
I give it three out of five stars for their sake alone, but everyone else should pass it by
which isn't exactly a ringing endorsement
Overall, "DinoCroc" was a much better movie
Sure, in that movie Matt Borlenghi played a complete wuss-bag who spent the entire movie crying about his little brother getting eaten by the DinoCroc
But the special effects in "DinoCroc" were better, the plot lines were better, and the acting was better
Here are the problems with "Blood Surf" -- 1) the killer crocodile looks like a kid's model with a retractable jaw
get shipwrecked on a deserted island, in which they encounter a rabid group of ugly Filipino natives who try to force themselves upon the women in the group
Which was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film
There are a couple of redeeming qualities of "Blood Surf" -- the actresses are pretty attractive and Matt Borlenghi gets eaten by the croc towards the end of the movie
But if you're on your deathbed and only have enough time to watch one Matt Borlenghi/killer crocodile movie, skip this one and fire up "DinoCroc" instead
This really is one of the worst movies ever made
I consider myself a HUGE zombie film fan and usually tolerate bad acting, lame "special effects" a dumb story and whatever you may encounter in second rate movies, AS LONG as the film has a good atmosphere/story/suspension or whatever to offer
This one has basically no positive aspect to it and is third or fourth rate, maybe worse
Some friends of mine and myself made a small movie during a week´s holiday and definitely did a better job (no zombie film though)
<br /><br />This flick is not even funny, not speaking of anything else
Really bad and redundant special effects, zombies that look like normal people (except for a white additional skin pulled over their faces), WAY TO MUCH fake blood (I like realism a lot, the combination of realism and Zombie films being debatable, but the presented gore is just plain silly)
The camera stays quite long with feedings scenes, it gets boring and you cannot help but wonder, why the zombies use WEAPONS (!) to kill their prey
I will not go into the details of the dubbing (others have done so)
Although I am from Germany myself and am at least a bit curious about the original version, I will NOT waste more of my time with this movie
<br /><br />Keep away from it, as far as you can
A terrible movie containing a bevy of D-list Canadian actors who seem so self-conscious about the fact they are on-camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable
<br /><br />This film is badly written, badly edited, and badly directed
It is disjointed, incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way
McDowell does a great job with what he is given, but is the only one in this film to do so - he really has a bad story and script to work with
<br /><br />I have yet to see Van Pelleske act in a credible manner, and even the sub-characters like Eisen (with his nasal, whiny voice) confirm that we are on a lot in Toronto rather than on a barge off Africa
<br /><br />Didn't the director see that the 'creature' looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit? The fight between the blue bolts of lightning and Pelleske's orange wisps of 'magic' (!?! for lack of a better word), is obviously the result of bad actors, with no choreographer, overlaid with completely derivative special effects
Was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film (not the good kind)? <br /><br />Learn from the mistakes of others
don't even waste your time with this one, you'll regret it like I did
I have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid
Flat, soulless computer images on less than astonishing backgrounds animates a horribly predictable story in this film
Absolutely nothing takes you by surprise, you can even tell when the Bryan Adams vocals are going to come in, which are always at the wrong time
<br /><br />The main character, Spirit the horse, is given an annoying voice when he narrates what is happening
The narration is not needed, though, as everything happening is really obvious
You can even tell what the horses are saying, although all they do is neigh
Which would be good, but all the horses make exactly the same sounds - one for warning, one for sorrow, one for laughing, etc
There is no variation between the horses' voices
<br /><br />Young kids might like this film, though
It's soppy enough for a family to sit down and watch, and there's little danger of anyone being frightened
If you have nothing else to do, and want to watch a film with your kids, this isn't a bad choice
<br /><br />But otherwise, this isn't recommended
Even if 99,99% of people that has seen this movie is Brazilian, I'll keep up with the English since it is the language of this website
<br /><br />This movie is a piece of cr*p
Worst acting I have seen for a loooong time
This was the first time I saw someone with less facial expression than Arnold Schwarzenegger, and one single voice tone, like a 5 years-old kid reading in front of the class
How can someone so bad be the main actor of a movie ? The storyline is so shallow my daughter could have done better (she is 3 yrs old)
It is so simple it could be written in a napkin and told in 3 minutes
<br /><br />There are only three possibilities for someone enjoy this movie: 1) you are a pre-teen; 2) you have been so brainwashed by Globo's stupidities that you think that anything that has the Globo's seal is awesome; 3) you have a serious brain damage
<br /><br />Avoid at all costs ! A shame to the Brazilian movie scene
Ram Gopal Verma has proved himself as a very innovative and competent director
He had done a remake/reworking of Godfather with Sarkar, and succeeded tremendously
Ditto for Lolita which he made as Nishaabd
<br /><br />Sholay is been the movie he repeatedly says has inspired him the most
Unfortunately, he has managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring remake
<br /><br />The acting ranged from decent to very good, with Amitabh Bachchan being suitably menacing as the villain Babban
<br /><br />The songs were awful and forgettable
The Mehbooba Mehbooba song came off as a second rate music video
<br /><br />The worst part was the pacing, and the dialogues - which were forgettable
<br /><br />Watching the movie in a theatre, I found myself waiting for the intermission, and then for the ending
Some viewers were wise not to wait, and were seen leaving throughout the duration of the film
Ultimately, one of the worst movies made by Ram Gopal Verma
I can't say this is one of the best films I have ever seen
But then again, I can't say it's one of the worst I have ever seen
<br /><br />OK, so it's basically a girl does skating, is good at it, wants to go to an expensive school, can't afford it and has to take a Hockey Scholarship
She has to hide her skating secret from her friends
<br /><br />Personally, I didn't like the actress playing Katelin
She absolutely couldn't cry to save her life, just made wailing sounds, like a toddler pretending to cry to get it's own way
<br /><br />Katelin was just an annoying person
The way she tried to act all nice and helpful to people
Also the part where the two skaters are calling her names and they say something about her choreographer and she says she 'draws the line' made me cringe
<br /><br />We all knew where it was going to go with her and Spencer
Classically they didn't like each other and sort of get together at the end was just typical
<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a movie to watch if you like skating but if you don't mind the main skater being extremely annoying
I won't add to the plot reviews, it's not very good
<br /><br />Very improbable orphanage on Bala
<br /><br />Cushing and Lee at their height
<br /><br />Good for face spotting, and I quote, "look at the mouth, that is Cassie from Fools and Horses"
<br /><br />Otherwise, a poor example of the British film industry
<br /><br />Fulton MacKay was far better in Fraggle Rock, Keith Barron was better in anything else and Diana Dors did what she did best
<br /><br />Redeeming feature? It was free to watch on the Horror channel prior to its going over to subscription
I recently watched this again and there's another version which is shorter 1999
I get the feeling they are the same movie but I would like to know the difference
<br /><br />One is Japanese and no pikachu short is all I can come up with
Ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice?? <br /><br />Prof Ivy was rather boring
She sounded as if she was almost asleep, no expression at all with the few lines she had
<br /><br />This was enjoyable enough but there wasn't much to it at all
<br /><br />A collector (whos after Lugia, he has no plan to destroy the world) and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture Lugia causes a lot of destruction
<br /><br />The pokemon movies that follow are slightly better, deoxys (poke 7) is great, with no
When I look back on my college days at Ohio University, there will always be one event in which I will remember with fond memories
Channel 23 is OU's local access channel and until the last few years, pretty much played anything they were sent
This included many DIY movies ranging from a guy microwaving marshmallow Peeps and then scanning pictures of them online, to a version of Macbeth starring 8th graders who had apparently just learned how to make squibs
<br /><br />However, the king, in my opinion, of the channel 23 lineup was Midnight Skater
The first time I watched it was around 2AM
My roommate and I watched Midnight Skater, and when it was complete, I don't think either of us believed that any of the movie had just happened
But sure enough, it was on a few nights later, and we had to come to grips that this movie did, in fact, exist
<br /><br />I could go on and on about how awful it is, but its the sort of awful that makes life worth living
The plot is disjointed, the acting terrible, the everything soul scarring, but by god, if there are others watching with you, its impossible not to have a good time watching it
Its sort of like the first time you hear "Guts" by Chuck Pahalniuk
You hear it, you're disgusted and shaken, but five minutes later, all you want and desire is to make someone else experience the abject horror you just endured
<br /><br />Long story short, Midnight Skater, for all of its epic flaws, makes for some very late night fun
Plus, I desperately want the Theme to Midnight Skater
He was great in "Walking Tall" and had a good bit-part in "Goldeneye", but here in "Final Justice" all hope is gone
<br /><br />As with most of humanity, my main experience with this one was on MST3K, and what an experience it was! Mike and the robots dig their claws deep into Baker's ample flesh and skewer this flick completely
It's obvious they were just beginning with "Mitchell" on their anti-Joe Don kick and here lies their continuation on a theme
<br /><br />It makes for a funny experience, though: there are plenty of choice riffs
My favorites - "John Rhys-Davies for sale", "It's 'Meatloaf: Texas Ranger'", "none of them are sponge-worthy", "Why was she wearing her prom dress to bed", and my favorite - "'Son of a
'? What? What was he the son of: son of a PREACHER MAN?"<br /><br />By itself, "Final Justice" is, as Joe Don puts it in the movie, "a big fat nada"
But here, it actually has some entertainment value
You get a chance, catch THIS version of "Final Justice"
<br /><br />Two stars for "Final Justice"
<br /><br />Oh, and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don's in town
I usually try to be professional and constructive when I criticize movies, but my GOD!!! This was THE worst movie I have ever seen
Bad acting, bad effects, bad script, bad everything! <br /><br />The plot follows a group of teen cliche's on their way to a rave (that takes place in broad daylight) at a remote island
However, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes
Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party-goers, the clan set's off on a mission through a zombie-infested forest
During this crusade, they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids
They also meet up with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors
Basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the "house of the dead
" This fight came complete with cheesy Hollywood violence, redundant clips from the HOTD video game, and sloppy matrix-esque camera rotations
One of the character's even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others
Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled! I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy?!?<br /><br />To sum it all up, there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is
The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I wasted seeing this piece of sh*t could easily cover the costs it took to make it
Okay, what the hell kind of TRASH have I been watching now? "The Witches' Mountain" has got to be one of the most incoherent and insane Spanish exploitation flicks ever and yet, at the same time, it's also strangely compelling
There's absolutely nothing that makes sense here and I even doubt there ever was a script to work with, but somehow I couldn't turn it off
The scratching your head with confusion starts right away, with an opening sequence about an angry little girl that killed her mother's cat
So you think this film revolves on children possessed by evil forces? Heck no, because after this intro, the girl and her wickedness simply aren't mentioned anymore
Then cut to a guy, with the most impressively trimmed mustache you'll ever see, who breaks up with his girlfriend in a rather unsubtle way
When she asks him to spend his vacation with her, he promptly phones his employer requesting him any type of assignment! Great move
The movie finally starts now, as he travels to an isolated mountain area to photograph some peaks
Though not before he picks up a new girl (Patty Shepard) and photographs her topless! Throughout their journey, all kind of strange events occur that  you guessed it  are never explained
The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, loud petrifying music plays everywhere and someone even steals the jeep! Really, car jacking witches? Apparently a coven of silent witches owns the mountains and they practice voodoo on trespassers
That's as close as I get describing the plot, but there's a good chance I'm way off More important here is the atmosphere! "The Witches' Mountain" is occasionally very creepy, with its spooky music and interesting cinematography
The supportive characters all look uncanny and the ravishing Patty Shepard plays a good heroine
This is the type of European horror film that could have been legendary, if only someone had bothered to write a structured screenplay
This was a great book and the possibilities for a truly great film were definitely there
But the casting decisions completely wrecked the movie
Hanks is a great actor to be sure, but lacks the smarmy, morally ambivalent characteristics needed for the lead role
<br /><br />Putting Melanie Griffiths in, for eye candy reasons, is understandable, but again, she did not portray the depth or ambivalence, so need to pull this off
<br /><br />This movie is a great example of how every decision, even those early on in the movie production can make or break a file
1st watched 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Steve Purcell): Typical Mary Kate & Ashley fare with a few more kisses
It looks to me like the girls are getting pretty tired of this stuff and it will be interesting what happens to them if they ever decide to split up and go there own ways
In this episode of their adventures they are interns in Rome for a `fashion' designer who puts them right into the mailroom to learn what working hard is all about(I guess
Besides the typical flirtations with boys there is nothing much else except the Rome scenario until about ¾ way into the movie when it's finally revealed why they are getting fired, then re-hired, then fired again, then re-hired again
This is definetly made by people who don't understand the corporate world and it shows in their interpretation of it
Maybe the real world will be their next adventure(if there is one
Even my kids didn't seem to care for this boring `adventure' in the make-believe
Let's see they probably only have a couple of years till their legal adults
The words "Swedish" and "Action movie" do not mix
That becomes more and more obvious with every attempt made in the genre
<br /><br />Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) works at a military air base with top secret computer systems
One day foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he doesn't do what they tell him
They want the secret equipment and will do anything to get it
<br /><br />This movie has it's ups and downs
And usually in Swedish action movies there are no "ups", just "downs"
So i guess something in this movie showed some quality
To begin with the positive remarks i can mention that the movie is technically well made
The footage of planes and helicopters flying are well shot and look very nice
Shanti Roney makes a decent performance while Maria Bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual (i wonder how long Swedish directors are going to keep using her even though she has the acting skills of a wooden plank?)
Stefan Sauk is laughable as the "cool" special forces man who comes to the base to investigate
<br /><br />And what about the action scenes? Well as i said above the scenes of planes and helicopters flying are nice
But aside from that there is not much action to talk about
And that is a common problem with Swedish action films
Maybe it's a budget problem, maybe it's film-making culture
I don't know, but it negatively affects the experience
Because quite frankly, the story and acting is not good enough for this movie to rely just on that
I saw this trailer and thought to myself my god is this movie for real, who would want to see this movie and at the same time i thought that, my girl friend turned to me and said "we have to go see this movie"
enough said so i saw this about 5 minutes go and I tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there weren't even any of those
It has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen the director has no influence no perspective the same shots were used again and again he did not build up suspense the cast probably were simply told scream cry run fall
I would love to see the script as the first 40 mins was mostly annoying girly giggles and bad music, there was absolutely no character development
well there was no plot it was basically I know we will terrorize a high school group on their prom night with a stalker serial killer, That's brilliant! hmmm The acting was what you expect in a Australian soap opera hopeless, that main character the Blondie god dam she annoyed me
her longest line must have been half a sentence, and every time she was on camera she was just pulling another rude facial expression
<br /><br />Please listen to me if you have any taste in movies don't go see this, and if your like me and don't have a choice well then I wish you good luck, maybe smuggle in an ipod or magazine
"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" was one of the many '50s movies about hot-rodding teens encountering the supernatural
In this case, the teens can't pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted
With nowhere else to go, they decide on an apparently haunted house
As you may have guessed, once they arrive, some weird things start happening
<br /><br />There's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen in other movies, but it's nice entertainment nonetheless
My favorite character was the foul-mouthed parrot
Well, let me rephrase that: he didn't talk like a character in a Quentin Tarantino movie, but he said things that we don't expect out of a bird
Ghost Town starts as Kate Barrett (Catherine Hickland) drives along an isolated desert road, her car suddenly breaks down & she hears horses hoofs approaching
Deputy Sheriff Langley (Frank Luz) of Riverton County is called in to investigate Kate's disappearance after her father reports her missing
He finds her broken down car & drives off looking for her, unfortunately his car breaks down too & he has to walk
Langley ends up at at a deserted rundown ghost town, much to his shock Langley soon discovers that it is quite literally a ghost town as it's populated by the ghosts of it's former residents & is run by the evil Devlin (Jimmie F
Skaggs) who has kidnapped Kate for reasons never explained & it's up to Langley to rescue her & end the towns curse
<br /><br />The one & only directorial effort of Richard Governor this odd film didn't really do much for me & I didn't like it all that much
The script by Duke Sandefur tries to mix the horror & western genres which it doesn't do to any great effect
Have you ever wondered why there aren't more horror western hybrid films out there? Well, neither have I but if I were to ask myself such a question I would find all the answers in Ghost Town because it's not very good
There are plenty of clichés, on the western side of things there's the innocent townsfolk who are to scared to stand up to a gang of thugs who are terrorising them, the shoot-outs in the main street, saloon bars with swing doors & prostitutes upstairs & horror wise there's plenty of cobwebs, some ghosts, an ancient curse, talking corpses & a few violent kills
I was just very underwhelmed by it, I suppose there's nothing terribly wrong with it other than it's just dull & the two genres don't sit together that well
There are a few holes in the plot too, why did Devlin kidnap Kate? I know she resembled his previous girlfriend but how did he know that & what was he going to do with her anyway? We never know why this ghost town is full of ghosts either, I mean what's keeping them there & what caused them to come back as ghosts? Then there's the bit at the end where Devlin after being shot says he can't be killed only for Langley to kill him a few seconds later, I mean why didn't the bullets work in the first place?<br /><br />Director Governor does alright, there's a nice horror film atmosphere with some well lit cobweb strewn sets & the standard Hollywood western town is represented here with a central street with wooden buildings lining either side of it
I wouldn't say it's scary because it isn't, there's not much tension either & the film drags in places despite being only just over 80 odd minutes in length
Forget about any gore, there a few bloody gunshot wounds, an after the fact shot of two people with their throats slit & someone is impaled with a metal pole & that's it
<br /><br />I'd have imagined the budget was pretty small here, it's reasonably well made & is competent if nothing else
Credit where credit's due the period costumes & sets are pretty good actually
The acting is alright but no-ones going to win any awards
<br /><br />Ghost Town is a strange film, I'm not really sure who it's meant to appeal to & it certainly didn't appeal to me
Anyone looking for a western will be annoyed with the dumb horror elements while anyone looking for a horror film will be bored by the western elements
It's something a bit different but that doesn't mean it's any good, worth a watch if your desperate but don't bust a gut to see it
The tragedy of the doomed ship Titanic has inspired many books and movies
The battle between nature and technology always caught man's imagination
The latest film concerning this tragedy in the Atlantic Ocean was written and directed by famous action movie filmmaker James Cameron
The story of "Titanic" involves two fictional characters (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) from different backgrounds (one is a hobo-artist, the other is an aristocrat) and how their love triumphs over societal barriers and the tragedy of a sinking ship that they happen to be on
<br /><br />First of all, although using a historical name, this movie had little regard to history
The plot was built around two fictional lovers, French diamond, and treasure hunters
The deaths of over a thousand of people on the greatest luxury ship of its time became a mere background
Many historical facts were simply forgotten
Where was the radio operator that ignored the iceberg warnings? Why was there no mention of the ship that was only 5 miles away from the Titanic but did not come to the rescue because its captain failed to identify the distress signal? Omitting these facts is an insult to the tragedy
And what was the point of flavoring this historical disaster with fictional cheesy romance when the story is already as sad as it is
<br /><br />The overall plot was rather shallow; rich equals greed and corruption, poverty equals compassion and heroism
It is very ironic to spend $200 million to make a movie about how money corrupts
There was absolutely no human side shown in anti-heroes
It seemed like Billy Zane was playing a part of the devil
If DiCaprio was 2 inches shorter than Winslet, you could swear she was his baby-sitter
The length of the movie was unnecessarily stretched to over 3 hours
First hour and the half was wasted on establishing the relationships between the characters that were known to audience long before they went to theater and the dialogue that was used to do so made it even worse
Hearing corny pick up lines such as "I see you" and "This is my side of the ship" generated more pain than the screams of drowning people
Also, jokes were too abundant and rather lame
<br /><br />"Titanic" did involve some moving scenes such as the part when the musicians were playing while the ship was sinking but they were no way near anything original
The best thing about this film were its special effects, and that is the only thing that truly deserved an award
<br /><br />Although this film lacked artistical value in overall sense, the public could not resist a sentimental story starring Romeo (DiCaprio), and so the movie became a success
Now it is safe to say that the industry will be less hesitant to invest large amounts of money in a single motion picture, so it seems that "Titanic" did achieve something after all
<br /><br />It tries to be a spoof on scifi/thriller films of the 1950s and 1960s but all it succedes at is making you wish really badly that you were watching one of them and not it
A spoof has to have some aspect which has some above par quality to it
I admit, I had to fast forward through this poorly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes -- NOTHING was happening, and everyone has already described the "plot
" But has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's impaled on the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing the bratty kid did it, put it's never explained
<br /><br />I wish this had been a better written or thought out film, because what we're left with if pretty daft and a movie that makes no sense isn't a "clever" movie, it's just a poorly executed film
<br /><br />I would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage, I would like to see if it would help
Otherwise, this is an odd little film that is best if fast-forwarded through
From the very opening scene you will notice just how hard they tried to mimic the very smart and powerful 'Cruel Intentions', and how flat it landed
You'll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting Robin Dunne as Valmont
Then in the second scene, you meet the two best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother
That is, if you can get past the fact that Kathryn wasn't blonde in the first film
Then the movie goes on, you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago, and you notice Sebastian has already met an Anette in the past, here called Danielle, and a Cecile, here called Cherie
Then it turns into a low budget 'Wild Things' type of film with lots and lots of oh-my "twists"
As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice
He just doesn't have the charisma Ryan did
Amy Adams, who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time, once again delivers
But with all the talent in the world, there is no way one could save this trash
As a whole, this "movie" feels like a 'Beverly Hills, 90210' episode
The score has been stolen from 'Cruel Intentions' and 'Jawbreaker'
Couldn't they at least leave that one alone?! You'll want to pass this one
If you want more Cruel Intentions, watch Stephen Frears' Dangerous Liaisons
This was a painful example of a cheap, boring and unoriginal show produced by Australian TV stations to fulfil local content quotas
The writing was truly terrible and I'm not surprised that the writers are those responsible for the worst Australian film in recent memory the Honerable Wally Norman
<br /><br />Nothing about this TV series was funny - ever - not even mildly amusing
It was just tired and BAD and, worst of all, it really thought it was funny
<br /><br />There is something very suss about this show being given 10 out of 10 on IMDb
Try to find a (real) review by a (real) Australian viewer of the show (there weren't many) and it is impossible
There are loafs of bread that are funnier than this show
<br /><br />Avoid the show at all cost and if it does come out on DVD, remember that the laughter THAT deserves was unintentional
**SPOILERS**KHAMOSH is totally unrealistic, lacks a plot, and was basically only made to see stars portray themselves
The most suspenseful scene in the movie was when Shabana Azmi is in the shower and then we see her TV playing the shower scene from PSYCHO
This movie actually expected users to believe that Naseeruddin Shah's character has a good enough memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how many!<br /><br />***SPOILER BEGINS***<br /><br />At the end, the killer spills his guts to Shabana Azmi long enough to allow Naseeruddin Shah's character to run up and shoot him!<br /><br />***SPOILER ENDS***<br /><br />It is a little humorous (only a little) in the beginning to hear the director and cast members throwing insults at each other and hearing Shabana Azmi exclaim, "Oh sh-t!"<br /><br />Overall, a baaaaaaaaaaad movie!<br /><br />Rating: ** out of ********** (2 out of 10
My husband and I went to watch it last night
It's just a small theater, but there's usually a decent amount of people there
Not this time! My husband and I were the ONLY people watching Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why
<br /><br />The movie was by far one of the worst I've ever seen
The acting, script & dialog, directing, editing, etc
was God-awful! Since we were alone in the room, we felt free to talk during the movie
That is, we talked about how bad it was, that it reminded us of The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Godzilla, Mortal Combat AND The Lord of the Rings
It was like we expected to see Rita and Lord Zed portraying commanders of Sauron's army
<br /><br />The creatures were ridiculous
You can't just introduce legions of dino/dragon/lizard things loaded down with cannons without explanation
The Lord of the Rings has a wide spectrum of characters, but it introduces and develops them over 3 movies, not in an hour and a half
<br /><br />The scene transitions are horrible
I didn't fall asleep during the movie, but even though it was an overly simple plot, I found myself getting lost in the plot holes
<br /><br />The characters were caucasian Americans, but spoke almost with broken English because of the badly written dialog in the script
<br /><br />The final scene that could have redeemed some value of the movie
though he hadn't known her for very long during THIS life anyways
He didn't seem too upset to be left in "Mordor", not knowing where he was or how to get back
We couldn't for the love of God figure out where he was or how he got there either, but if he wasn't upset we shouldn't be either
<br /><br />Oh, and why did the dress that Sarah's spirit was wearing look like she borrowed it from Queen Elizabeth? One more thing
all 3 of the main hero characters were reincarnations brought back to finish the job
Sarah completes her task and moves on to the afterlife
Then why does Ethan get screwed? He's left alone, without the girl, without a map/compass/helicopter to help him get back
What's he supposed to do? Send smoke signals? And IF he gets back home, does he just go back to his job? He should have been given the same mercy of getting killed out of the movie that the other heroes had
<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money on this movie
We only stayed til the end because we'd paid for it, but as soon as the credits hit, we were out the door
It was the Sixties, and anyone with long hair and a hip, distant attitude could get money to make a movie
That's how Michael Sarne, director of this colossal flop, was able to get the job
Sarne is one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie
In fact, the whole studio must have been tricked into agreeing to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film, a terribly precious 60's-hip black and white featurette called Joanna
That film starred the similarly talentless actress/waif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat-like twitter
Sarne, who was probably incapable of directing a cartoon, never mind a big-budget Hollywood film, was in way over his head
David Giler's book is the best place to go to find out how the faux-infant terrible Sarne was able to pull the wool over everyone's eyes
If there is ever an historical marker which indicates the superficiality and shallowness of an era, Myra Breckinridge provides that marker
It embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea-change in the body politic
Breckinridge is a touchstone of another, equally important vein
Watch this movie and you'll get a different perspective on the less-often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years
<br /><br />Many reviewers have spoken about the inter-cutting of footage from other films, especially older ones
Some actually liked these clunky "comments" on what was taking place in the movie, others found them senseless, annoying, and obtrusive, though since the film is so bad itself any intrusion would have to be an improvement
<br /><br />In my opinion, the real reason Michael Sarne put so many film clips into Myra Brekinridge was to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed
That is to say, Sarne was so imagination-challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time
They weren't inspiration, they were desperation
His writing skills were nonexistent, and David Giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb, so Sarne was left to actually try and make a movie, and he couldn't
Hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film's worth of clips
The ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because Sarne sure as heck wasn't able to
This was what he came up with on those days he sat on the set and thought for eight hours while the entire cast and crew (not to mention the producers and the accountants) cooled their heels and waited for something, some great spark of imagination, a hint of originality, a soupcon of wit, to crackle forth from the brow of Zeus
No Zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each made from the hundreds of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window
<br /><br />As for myself, I hated the film clips
They denigrated Sarne's many betters, poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration, originality - and even of plain competency - compared to even the cheesiest of them
The fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour
In fact there are more questions than answers in this one-sided tale of romance and murder; and since we are only provided with the prosecution's side, none of these questions will be answered
This is the type of fare that appeals to the "He Woman, Man Hater" clubs of America
As presented, it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be "caught up" in a romance with a married, high-profile attorney
Is it possible that IF, she had not been two timing her boy friend and having an affair with a married man, the whole nasty murderous, sordid incident could have been avoided? When you watch this, don't worry about going to the 'fridge, you won't miss anything
Like so many media experiments, this amateurish effort contains seeds of a very interesting social commentary
In the 5+ years since it was released, the premise has been made less outrageous by real world events in software development, and I found it less boring than the previous commentator for that reason, I imagine
The director clearly is a fan of Hitchcock, and it's too bad that the film was not better executed, but in fact, it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction, including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention
One can almost see the exclamation points and capital letters on a yellowing page
<br /><br />I have to admit I found it rather entertaining for all these reasons and more
Sometimes the slick has less to offer us, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for education purposes
Oh yes--and even though the seams showed and it creaked a lot, my heart rate went up, and I was reluctant to get up and take a break
its a gem movie if anyone who hasn't seen movie sholey he cant understand what is going on there
a thakur call men for catching a big terrorist who is like god and even police don't know abut him but these ppl do
<br /><br />biggest advantage of film is its speed u never know what is going on and the part is completed
actors are at there best of worst acting and actress is here for time-pass of songs
and what u cant forget is the cool dialouge which seems to come in very long time but u cant understand them so easily try hard for that and last word i haven't seen movie complete due to a brain roast so plz tell me ditz end if it hav
Soon after watching this film you will realize why it didn't even make it to the theaters! This movie does not deserve the "prequel" tag
Instead this is a common theme in Hollywood, rip off previously good movies with disastrous prequels, sequels, etc
<br /><br />This film's plot was bouncing all over the place like a ping pong ball, and the character development was non-existent
I seriously felt like I was watching a comedy at some points in the movie because the acting was so bad
P Diddy needs to stop tainting movies with his horrible acting, he actually made me laugh every time
<br /><br />The only good thing that comes out of this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis, who looks excellent in this movie and actually brought some enjoyment from watching this film
<br /><br />If you are a big Carlito's Way fan, I recommend you not watch this
If you decide to watch it anyway then treat this movie as if it ripped off the original, because that is exactly what it did
A badly-acted two-character comedy-drama abruptly transmogrifies into a weren't-we-awful-to-the-Indians polemic, with lousy special effects, exploitative use of nudity, and ugly violence
It's as sincere as a politician's handshake, as obvious as a car salesman's pitch, one of the worst movies in the history of the universe
Not sure why this film was advertised as a wild, quirky, laugh filled comedy
There is not much in this movie that will entertain, nor amuse the moviegoer
Annette Bening (whose acting was touted as being Oscar worthy) comes off here as mannered, with her performance seeming routine
Brian Cox's character is confusing and irritating, and the lead playing Augusten  Joseph Cross  appears to simply not have the personality to carry his role
The best thing about the film is Evan Rachel Wood, but she is not enough to endorse this boring, unsavory film
<br /><br />The film disappeared quickly and it seems with good reason
I found some of the scenes distasteful (the scene with Brian Cox and his just utilized toilet rivals some of the worst scenes in 'You and Me and Everyone We Know' and 'The Squid and the Whale'), some embarrassing, and most of them unsettling
I found the whole experience a waste of time
Sogo Ishii can be a skilled filmmaker under the right conditions, but Gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival, a scion of the Genji clan
The film-making has the main hallmarks of a low-budget production, including blurry fight scenes and clumsy montages (the kind you might find in an under-produced dorama)
The monk Benkei informs his spiritual teacher that his destiny lies in defeating the mysterious spirit that guards Gojoe bridge at night, but he doesn't realize that this decision will bring him squarely into conflict with nearly every element of society at that time - but which could earn him enlightenment
<br /><br />There's no absence of ambitiousness, however, in its depiction of the conflict between the holy and the worldly
Artsy flourishes in some of the photography and editing help to compensate for the loose film-making style
FLIGHT OF FURY takes the mantle of being the very WORST Steven Seagal flick I've ever seen
<br /><br />It's a dreadful bore with no action scenes of any interest, Seagal isn't really trying in this - he's fat and his voice is dubbed once more
<br /><br />The Co-stars fare no better, being a rather sorry load of 3rd raters
<br /><br />The Direction by Keusch is very poor and it comes as no surprise that he's also responsible for another couple of Seagal stinkers (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE) The screenplay Co-written by Seagal himself is laughably inept
<br /><br />According to IMDb $12M was spent on this boring load of old tosh - If these figures are correct I sense a big tax fiddle as nowhere near that amount was spent
<br /><br />FLIGHT OF FURY is actually a shot for shot remake of the Michael Dudikoff flick BLACK THUNDER - which has to be better than this tripe
<br /><br />This has NO redeeming qualities whatsoever,Give it a MISS! 1/2 * out of ****
This film was made and cast from my home town
I remember the fuss about it and the whole hullabaloo about the fact Molly Ringwald was in town
<br /><br />Essentially 20 years after a film was "laid to rest" without being finished, a group of film students set out to complete it - with dire consequences
It would seem someone does not want the film completed
One has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little tounge in cheek, but it had no real oomph
The characters are mostly transperant and the little info that you recieve about them you just don't care about, it seems irrelevant
It is weird hearing Kylie's accent as Australian again and nice to see a kid I went to school with in a starring role
Goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in Molly Ringwald
Perhaps due to the nature of the film (it sort of pays homage to 80s films / bad horror films)but really an Aussie actor would have done just fine
<br /><br />As far as casting is concerned a lot of the acting seemed constipated
Some of these kids (especially the two main chics - they played "director" and "producer") looked like they were trying to act
Also, the shots had a rough feel about them
Over lit perhaps? Just not as smooth as one is used to
Could it be less frightening? There are some shock factors though, and a couple of gross scenes
I did like the film, but it was not great
It went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less
Perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better
They had a lot of characters get killed - but no real build up to them getting slayed
Maybe if they had killed less people and actually concentrated on a scary atmosphere it would have been better
<br /><br />Now I know it is a comedy and elements were funny
The first half of the film is OK, the second half one of the most tedious experiences imaginable
Quite possibly the most overrated movie of all time
"Pulp Fiction" was robbed for "Best Picture
" This is one of those films that people feel required to love because the main character is "slow
While the original First Blood had its far-fetched moments, it was at least exciting in parts
In Rambo: First Blood, Part II the emphasis is shifted very much onto comic-book action
Plausibility is totally rejected; logic nose-dives; Stallone becomes so impregnable that there can be no doubt he will succeed in his mission
Just like any other wish-fulfilment actioner of that time (e
Invasion USA, Commando, Red Scorpion), Rambo: First Blood, Part II cancels out its own opportunities for real excitement by presenting a hero too invulnerable to fear for
If you can tell from the word go that Rambo is going to wipe out hundreds of enemy soldiers, what is left to get excited about?<br /><br />Imprisoned after the events of the first movie, John J Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is offered a pardon if he will join a covert operation in the Far East
The year is 1985, and a mission is being arranged to find out if there are any American PoWs still trapped in the jungles of Vietnam
Rambo is encouraged to take the job by his old mentor Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), but the assignment is actually the brainchild of a government outfit fronted by Marshall Murdock (Charles Napier)
Rambo's job is merely to head for a prison camp in the jungle and check out if it contains any American PoWs  if it doesn't, he is to rendezvous with a chopper; if it does, he is to get photographic evidence of their existence so that they can be rescued at a later date
Aiding him in his quest is a lady soldier with local knowledge, the beautiful and resourceful Co Bao (Julia Nickson)
Sure enough, Rambo discovers that there are PoWs in the camp, but he exceeds his orders by rescuing one of them when he reaches the rendezvous point, the rescue chopper abandons him on the orders of Murdock who, it seems, doesn't really want to find any PoWs because of the political and military implications
Rambo is captured by the enemy and tortured, but following an explosive escape he sets out to free the PoWs and get his revenge on the treacherous Murdock
<br /><br />The few good points of the film come from Jack Cardiff's polished photography, Jerry Goldsmith's exhilarating score, and the sheer professionalism of the stunt team in performing various action antics
Beyond these scant pickings, the film is a failure
The actors are reduced to macho posturing, the plot rings false, the action sequences are soulless and suspenseless, the dialogue is absurd even the violence becomes numbingly predictable
At the time of its release America was under the presidency of Ronald Reagan, a man with simplistic and near-hysterical anti-communist sentiments
For this reason, contemporary audiences lapped up this Commie-bashing shooting-fest as if it was the greatest movie of all-time, transforming it into an undeserved box office success
Thankfully times have changed  nowadays we can look upon it as a simple-minded action flick with a ludicrously high body count, ludicrously dumb politics, and a ludicrous hero
<br /><br />Pyramid Category: Movies that were funnier and more thrilling than Snakes on a Plane
<br /><br />Hell, with that definition I'd have to include the relatively harrowing journey of Ted and Elaine in Airplane! as superior to Snakes in both laughs and thrills
<br /><br />The sad truth is that this isn't even close to the mother of all unintentionally intentional funny snake movies: Anaconda! Besides the never to be seen again casting of JLo-Cube-O
Wilson-Stoltz-Wuhrer in the same flick, you had Jon Voight pulling off the all-time cinematic heist
His final scene alone represents everything SOAP tried and failed to do as a "so-ludicrous-it's-fun" movie
<br /><br />In the end, Snakes on a Plane is definitive proof that studio execs and fanboys make the worst collaborators possible
Every big scene had been discussed and dissected so much the last year, all that was left to amuse by opening night was the amount of fanboy flop-sweat that had to be mopped up at my theater
I heard more forced laughs here than at a studio taping for "According to Jim"
Harsh, yes, but I call 'em like I see 'em
<br /><br />I saw this in the late 80's, and it was truly one of the most awful, boring films I've ever forced myself to watch
<br /><br />Yes, the cinematography is lovely
The political backdrop is enticing, but unlike similar "historically set" stories (e
Zhivago_ (qv)), this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story, or even interesting
<br /><br />Sure, Olin and Binoche are beautiful
But this film manages to make even "erotic" scenes plodding and slow
I'm all for romance, but this movie was so boring, I started hoping the Russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery
<br /><br />I'm sure if I'd read the book, the story would have made a bit more sense
However, life's too short to expend any more time on this one
Tenants Two writers struggle to complete their books in an all but empty apartment house
They at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them begins to build
<br /><br />This is based upon a Bernard Malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are in that novel
Very little of the dialog is natural, its purple and brimming with shades of meaning
Its as if a college English major with a head full of pretensions wrote the script
It's awful and I found myself instantly immune to anything the film had to say, which is a shame since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom
Snoop Dog on down are fine form, unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the words and the premise
<br /><br />I can't really recommend this movie
While not really bad, its very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away
I lost interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the end
If you're interested I'd try it on cable, but I wouldn't lay out good money to see it
This movie has some of the worst acting that I have ever seen! Some scenes are original such as the nails coming through the floor
I can't believe that this movie is not even in the bottom 100 movies of all time
I also can't believe that there are sequels! The next crap movie that I want to watch is R
R really be much worse than this?<br /><br /
well well One cant b wasting time just cause of a big star-cast
i think all i could see is a bunch of talents wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor which will appeal to i do not know who? some pathetic songs that will be heard by who? some pathetically abrupt turnings justified by who? race against time? u mean waste against time? OK so first you spoil your kid,then you teach him a lesson wow we are so ignorant of this fact whoever said its a brilliant new concept probably is some other species other than human alright fine let me come comment like humans do movie has a nice message to be given but it could well have been given by a stranger sitting besides you in the bus rather than you going for such a wasteful movie to learn it Hindi movies have proved it a lot already and also i cant waste my time writing about waste anyway
<br /><br />First off, nothing really happened in this movie, other than a woman bleeding inexplicably
Third, it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever
The sound was edited by either Beavis or Butthead  I'm not sure which, so let's just go with Beavis
The movie gradually gets more and more quiet and the people mumble and mutter, forcing you to turn up the volume (I watched this at home)
Then Beavis blasts some really loud sounds with supposedly scary/shocking images, forcing you to quickly lower the volume again
This occurs many times until, mercifully, the movie ends
I can picture Beavis laughing vulgarly from behind the two-way mirror while watching the test group franticly reaching for the remote each time
If you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after they fall asleep, this one is a big mistake
Here's a thought  if you're going to make a horror movie, at least add a gratuitous beheading, a 19-year-old blond girl who screams at the top of her lungs just before she can take off her sweater, the shadow on the wall of someone being eaten alive just out of the camera range, a cat being thrown at the camera to scare the audience, some drifty weirdo with a maniacal laugh, or a monster who looks like a stage hand covered in aluminum foil (a la TV's Lost in Space)
Normally I would have given this movie a 6
It tackles a very important topic and it does it relatively well - despite Katie Wright which is an accomplishment in and of itself
<br /><br />I have no idea if she was actually instructed to play the character like this or is naturally irritating, but she did an awesome job at making it impossible for me to care for Lexi
There's no dimension to her other than how confused, helpless and clueless she is, and how good she is at whimpering
I can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorder has spiraled out of control would be distraught, scared and in pain
However, Wright's entire performance is based on incessant wailing and sniveling, the rest being whining
I couldn't help but feel this particular girl's problem was caused not by the demon that is Bulimia, but by her not having a backbone
I very much doubt that's the point the movie meant to make
I think I've seen worse films, so I'm giving this a 3, but it's a struggle to remember what they could have been!! Possibly Xtro (nasty & dull) or possibly Creep (just plain dull), but it is a struggle to think of something worse
Let's just say it's a poor man's Under Siege, starring an even poorer man's Jean Claude Van Damme
The only redeeming feature was seeing Casper Van Dien - I always wondered what happened to him after Starship Troopers
Yes, he was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know
<br /><br />Judging from this site, he's been stuck in TV movie hell
please!!!!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I've just turned over and there's a half decent film on called Criminal Law
now I'm beginning to get really resentful about the last 1
I can not believe such slanted, jingoistic material is getting passed off to Americans as art house material
Early on, from such telling lines like "we want to make sure they are playing for the right team" and manipulative framing and lighting, A Love Divided shows it's true face
The crass manner in which the Irish Catholics are shown as hegemonic, the Protestants as peaceful and downtrodden, is as poor a representation of history as early US westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians
The truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the Irish Catholics in the story; a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves! It is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it's obvious intent, so far from attempting art
This film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library
This movie introduces quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first half-hour or so
None of them generate any interest or positive response
I waited for the intrigue to begin, hoping things would get better and ended up sticking around until the bitter end, but there was no reward for doing that
<br /><br />If you want a synopsis, look elsewhere
Not that the story was that bad, I guess you could say I had some problems with the script--i
A look at the credits will show you that there's a pretty strong cast here, used to no avail
Most of the old pros in this flick do good jobs; of the actors I hadn't seen much of before I especially liked Deborah Kara Unger
That's about all that I can find good to say about this picture
There's nothing I hate more than self-congratulating pretentiousness
Kevin Smith deserves to be hung up by his toenails for inspiring every white middle-class whiner to make a movie about why they can't get laid
I don't really mind inexperience and low-budget productions but when the writing is this obvious and cloying it really burns my potatoes
The money put into this could've gone to a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like John Gulager
If you watch Project Greenlight you'll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system
Anybody could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that doesn't manage to say anything really, at all
When will we be saved from the Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world? The revolution can't come soon enough
Go watch a real first time effort by buying Desperado or searching out Friends With Benefits
Hawked as THE MOST OFFENSIVE MOVIE EVER, GUARANTEED TO OFFEND EVERYONE- Guess what? It worked, I'm offended that we shelled out money to rent this
Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on TV was true
Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us! It was by far the worst movie I've seen since Hollow Man
I generally avoid the crappy ones, but got sucked into this one
We have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it, and his movie picking privileges have been revoked
There is nothing remotely funny about this movie
even the "adventures of dickman" scene was sophomoric at best
Thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason
NEVER WATCH THIS! for any reason whatsoever
Not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny
Please for the love of all that is holy, if you cherish your sanity- never view this movie
It's many things- stupid, pointless, and worthless to name a few
But the main thing it was aiming for: offensively funny- it failed miserably
This is just horrible, really horrible trash
Yes, we've got beautiful naked women dancing and having sex
But while this may work in the mechanism of a porn movie  may have even been a hit as a porn movie  this tries to mask itself as a "film" with actual things to say, with real emotion and struggle
It's an excuse to get some girls naked and have a fun time
I'm sure all of these women (and men) in this particular movie could have faired decently in the porn movie business of the 1970s
<br /><br />The acting was hackneyed, so bad, I mean real terrible
I can't lay all blame on these actors  they had nothing to work with
The very broad structure or plot of the movie could possibly be done and done well with good writers and competent actors
The very broad structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from afar, as a sniper
These shootings were motivated from men not respecting their women enough
If there was more writing - better writing, much better writing - and less gratuitous sexual imagery we might have something to work with
<br /><br />This movie should have been shot, made and marketed a hardcore porn movie all along; it would have made more money
It practically is a hardcore porn film already, and it remains the only non-porn movie I've seen that shows a male erect penis
I remember watching this film back in 86' when it first came out & what an awful film
The acting was atrocious the plot was so flimsy it would or is that should have blew away in a breath of wind
I think it put me to sleep on more than one occasion & i was not tired that i remember
Please avoid at all costs better still have all your teeth taken out with no anaesthetic cos that would be more entertaining
It's just a pity i couldn't give it a zero or a negative score
I wish i had not wasted my money getting this one from the video shop all i can say was that the tape it was on was still brand new practically hardly surprising as the film was so poor
If i remember right i sat & watched it with a girl i really wanted to go out with & the fact she was sat next to me was still not enough to keep me awake thats how bad this film was
Rip off of "Scream" or especially "I know what you did last summer", there's some entertainment here, and a little scary, but they needed some originality
I remember I saw this cartoon when I was 6 or 7
My grandfather picked up the video of it for free at the mall
I hated the fox that became Casper's friend
He was so stupid! Casper cried his head off if he couldn't find a friend
So what? Get over it! The only good part and I don't want to sound mean-spirited was when the fox got shot and died at the end
I laughed my head off in payback because this cartoon sucked so much
The bad news is the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost
I think I even gave the video of this to somebody because I hated it
No wonder they were offering it for free at the mall
If you have a child don't let them watch this
They will probably agree with me that it sucks
The original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won't do for the TV series because most people watch for the 1930s style
Ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the Underground can play at that game too
Hanging the storyline on a plot about the Jarrow March was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so I suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing
All the stuff about Japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time
This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show
It is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content
My husband and I went to see this movie, being the horror movie buffs that we are
Two hours later I found myself wanting both my money and time back
The teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film
There was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances, etc
I found most of the 'scary' parts to be more comical than anything
After viewing other movies based on the works of Japanese writers, I have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in Japan is not what is frightening here in the US
My advice: If you are a fan of true horror movies, save yourself the pain of sitting through this one
I can't really say that I would recommend renting it either, unless you have a free rental coming to you
Personally, while I'm able to appreciate really good movies, I also have a strange ability to somewhat enjoy even the most crappiest of crap
You know, those times when you just want to sit there and watch some horrible cookie-cutter action movie to kill time
This is the only movie that I can remember actually shutting off in the middle, and I have absolutely NO intention of going back to finish it
The plot was so contrived and predictable, I was calling out what the next scene would be easily (and I'm usually not very good at this)
The actors were horrible, I've seen better acting in middle school plays
Even the scene cuts were bad, the flow was all wrong
<br /><br />This movie is like a parody that forgot the funny
Somewhere, buried very deep inside this film is a half-way decent movie trying to get out
The only traces are a few early scenes in Los Angeles (in a bar and a graveyard) and thereafter a couple of pieces of production design
One of the biggest challenges faced by movies involving the supernatural is how to have characters react believably in unbelievable situations
Annie Mcenroe's reaction to being told that her sister (presumably Dee Wallace from the first movie) is (was?) a werewolf is, if I recall, along the lines of; "Oh! Really?"
Not one of the better responses to said challenge
The non sequitirs continue as the story moves to Trannsylvania in search of Stirba the (apparently self-appointed) "Queen of the Werewolves"
As Stirba, Sybil Danning is the two best things in the movie
Yes, even better than the werewolf group-sex scene, Reb Brown's acting, and the oddly simian-looking werewolf suits
The end credits have assumed minor legend status and are available in all their glory (at least until the censor finds them) on Youtube
Check them out to see why and remember, the whole film makes about the same amount of sense
If you happen to catch this on US television the credits have been re-edited to replace the endlessly repeated shot of Danning ripping off her top with another endlessly repeated shot of her ripping open a cloak only this time she has some kind of top on underneath
It's a sort of absurdity, cherry-on-top moment which defies satire
Worst movie I have seen since Gingerale Afternoon
I pretty much predicted every scene in this movie
I believe that I could come up with as good of effects from what I have lying around the house
I wish I could have something good to say about this movie, but I am afraid that I don't
Even Coolio should be ashamed of appearing in such a turkey
I do, after a little thought, have one thing good to say about this movie - it ended
As a veteran of many, many pretentious French films I thought I'd taken the worst the industry had to offer and was able to stomach anything
Pointless, relentless, violent, unpleasant, meaningless
The film has nothing to offer and is random hatred and aggression dressed up as pretentious art
I had to give this film a 1 because it's that bad, but don't make this think that I didn't enjoy watching, because I laughed and laughed, and I even had a few questions
So half of the time I was laughing, half of the time I was saying "what in the hell is going on?" or "why would someone do this?" et cetera
I mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effects, the 80's style nude scene/battle/dialogue/nude scene, and the way that the warrior's swords flap in the wind when they ride their horses
And there's some crappy model effects (those aren't supposed to be real trees, are they?) and I still don't understand this guy that they find in the cave, what in the hell is he? A friend of mine told me about these movies and I thought I would give em a try, and I basically liked the film as people like Ed Wood films, I have no real enjoyment of what the film was meant to be, I look at it in my own hilarious way
So don't let this distract you if you really thought this was an action movie, it is, I just liked it for other reasons
It's much, much worse than Evil Dead, so it can actually make you think as though you are wasting your life by watching it (which came into my mind a few times)
I guess the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks, have some friends around, and laugh at this film
Maybe this is a bit harsh, but I don't think so, rent it and you'll see
This movie kind of reminds me of A Mary-Kate and Ashley movie-only worse
Just the rich sisters kind of thing I think even though Alysons more the actress, in this movie Amanda michalka was okay sometimes but Alysons acting stunk
i think that after high-school musical they needed to come up with somethihng better and this definitely wasn't it
The story line wasn't that great and I think they should have gotten two other people to play Taylor and Courtney
I'm not a big Alyson Michalka fan and this movie didn't make me like her any better
i think they should definitely sick to singing and only watch this movie if you have nothing better to do (which sadly I didn't
I gave this movie a single star only because it was impossible to give it less
<br /><br />Scientists have developed a formula for replicating any organism
A group of industrial spies break in to steal the formula and the remainder of the film is one endless foot chase
<br /><br />Of course the T-Rex(a rubber puppet)gets loose and commences to wipe out the cast
It has the amazing ability to sneak up within 2 or 3 feet of someone without them noticing and then promptly bites their head off
<br /><br />One cast member escapes in a police car and spends the remainder of the film driving aimlessly through the city
She is of such superior mental ability that she can't even operate the radio
She never makes any attempt to drive to a substation or a donut shop and appears hopelessly lost
<br /><br />The T-Rex wreaks havoc throughout the city, there are blazing gun battles and buildings(cardboard mock-ups)blowing up, but a single police car, or the army, nor anyone else ever shows up
Such activity must be commonplace in Los Angeles
<br /><br />We can only hope that a sequel isn't planned
If you made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book, please don't give up on the series
I bought my first copy of any of the books in May of this year, and already I'm almost finished with book 10
I dare say the movie is a piece of trash that doesn't do the series even a sniff of justice
While "Left Behind: the movie" only vaguely follows the story of the "Left Behind" (the book), the characters aren't even close to accurate
<br /><br />A few examples: Rayford never acts on his feelings for Hattie (he is about to when he's informed of the vanishings); Buck Williams is a blonde haired, magazine writer, not a TV reporter; Chloe is at Stanford, and a lot of the book details Rayford wondering if she 'survived'; Buck and Chloe don't meet until much later, at a meeting in New York, set up by Hattie; Irene and Raymie are never 'in the book,' rather just in Rayford's flashback thoughts; the roads are so jam packed with wrecks following the rapture that Rayford and Hattie have to helicopter back to the suburbs
<br /><br />And that's just from the first movie; they're about to release the third
Please, even if you didn't like the movies, give the book series a chance
Nathan Detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in NYC, but the heat is on and he can't find a secure location
He bets chronic gambler Sky Masterson that Sky can't make a prim missionary, Sarah Brown, go out to dinner with him
Sky takes up the challenge, but both men have some surprises in store <br /><br />This is one of those expensive fifties MGM musicals in splashy colour, with big sets, loud music, larger-than-life roles and performances to match; Broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing, which I don't
My main problem with these type of movies is simply the music
I like all kinds of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but Broadway show tunes in swing time with never-ending pah-pah-tah-dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar aren't my cup of tea
This was written by the tag team of Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on a couple of Damon Runyon stories), and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak
Blaine's two numbers for example are identical, unnecessary, don't advance the plot and grate on the ears (and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you)
There are only two memorable tunes, Luck Be A Lady (sung by Brando, not Sinatra as you might expect) and Sit Down, You're Rockin' The Boat (nicely performed by Kaye) but you have to sit through two hours to get to them
The movie's trump card is a young Brando giving a thoughtful, laid-back performance; he also sings quite well and even dances a little, and is evenly matched with the always interesting Simmons
The sequence where the two of them escape to Havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise, bustle and vowel-murdering of Noo Yawk
Fans of musicals may dig this, but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show
Within 15 minutes, my whole family was rooting for Goldie Hawn's character to die, or at least for Steve Martin's character to leave her
There are only a couple of movies a year we try that turn out so annoying that we can't even stomach it long enough for the story to get established
<br /><br />Normally I like both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, and I remember enjoying the Neil Simon original
Combine the director of "Whats The Worst That Can Happen" and the writer of "Miss Congeniality 2", and I guess this is what we end up with
Frank Tashlin's 'The Home Front' is one of the more lifeless Private Snafu shorts, a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the military
Rather than have Snafu take some inadvisable actions leading to disaster, 'The Home Front' instead focuses on his loved ones back home and how much they have to offer to the war effort too
Snafu realises he was wrong when he thought they had it easy
It's a concept with few possibilities for good gags and instead Tashlin plays the risqué card more heavily, extended jokes involving strippers and scantily clad dancing girls in place of much effective comic relief
The result is a well-meaning short which has little relevance or entertainment value today other than as an historical artefact
Daniella has some issues brewing under her attractive exterior
She starts to lose her mind when she finds out about a distant relative (who she resembles) that was burned for being a werewolf
She goes a bit feral when she beads horny men and slashes out their throats
She does eventually find a man that helps contain her inner beast but when others ruin their bliss she extracts her violent and furry revenge
<br /><br />'Werewolf Woman' isn't a very goof film but it does pose as a good crowd film
A fun time could be had by harping the bad acting / dubbing / translation and the just plain cheesiness of the production
But on it's own it moves slowly but does have ample nudity to keep you awakebarely
I guess I have still enough brain left to NOT find this movie funny
-Great comedians - but a very poor movie! The "best" performance still did NINA HAGEN <br /><br />TRIVIA: Did you realize that it the "real world" scenes (in Hamburg) the cars are almost ONLY new BMWs ?? <br /><br />I guess I have still enough brain left to NOT find this movie funny
-Great comedians - but a very poor movie! The "best" performance still did NINA HAGEN <br /><br />TRIVIA: Did you realize that it the "real world" scenes (in Hamburg) the cars are almost ONLY new BMWs ?
I still can't believe how bad this movie was
If I wasn't a massochist I don't know if I would have survived the viewing
It looks like it cost about $1000 to make, but it wasn't the money that brought them down
The acting was horrid - not just bad, 3rd graders could have read the lines better
Second, the only other reason to watch this kind of movie is the skin, and that is sorely lacking in this flick
We don't even get to see the more attractive chicas in the buff
<br /><br />Ahh well, better luck next time eh
"A scientist discovers signals from space that appear to carry information concerning a series of seemingly unrelated natural disasters, occurring across the globe
Hoping to discover the source of these signals and who's behind them, the scientist and his wife set out on a trek to locate the intended recipient of the signals
What the couple eventually discovers is a small remote convent with occupants who are not really who they appear to be," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis
<br /><br />Kirk Scott (as Andrew Boran) is the scientist who intercepts alien messages on his computer
He suspects a series of "Large Earth Disruptions" may be connected to the weird space static
Scott and pretty blonde wife Sue Lyon (as Sylvia Boran) investigate the mysterious signals from outer space
They discover priestly, but creepy Christopher Lee (as "Father Pergado"), and other silliness
Given that, "End of the World" is remarkably dull
<br /><br />*** End of the World (1977) John Hayes ~ Kirk Scott, Sue Lyon, Christopher Le
Revenge is one of my favorite themes in film
Moreso, "the futility of revenge" is one of my favorite themes in film
Having seen Gaspar Noe's Irreversible (2002), I was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme
Instead, this film is a weak half-hearted attempt which expressed nothing but the film's lack of conviction and focus
<br /><br />*SPOILERS* The end scene, a gratuitous male-on-male rape/torture scene, came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy
However, the film doesn't even follow through with this
Instead, the drawn out scene (which FAR exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized) is crowned with a shot of Dawson's face in an expression of either regret or "This didn't fix anything" while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the background
<br /><br />My problem with the scene wasn't one of shock, but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience
I mean, do we feel bad for the rapist? Do we rejoice in Dawson's revenge? Are we disgusted by the brutality of it all? Do we feel Dawson's moment of regretful clarity? Aside from this failing, the film is really sort of awkwardly paced with more style than substance
Character's are thin, dialog is monotonous, etc
<br /><br />Normally I try to take films on their own terms but Descent didn't really seem to know what those were
Watching a videotaped replay of about 8 various 1994-1997 Spider-man cartoons made me realize why I couldn't stomach it when it first came out
<br /><br />I'm from the old school, where the 1967 Spider-man cartoon was the best and still remains the best
(I won't get into the psychedelic version which is terrible - give me traditional villains please
)<br /><br />The acting in the new stuff is lousy, read off a sheet with either no feeling or overacting
Paul Soles, where are you now? This guy was the best at voice acting for Spider-man
Watching Secret Wars, a great idea for a cartoon mini-series, made me wince
Doom sounds like a comedy version of Bela Lugosi
In a scene with Red Skull and Doc Ock, Red Skull has no German accent while Ock is heavy Russian! The old Marvel comic hero series from 1966 had much better voice acting
Iron Man sounded like he was wearing an iron mask, Captain America sounded authoritative not like some teenage kid
Paul Frees as the Thing in the 60s was the best Thing ever
The old voice actors were pioneers and there will never be anyone like them
Ever hear Mel Blanc's son? No way can he replicate his dad
Okay, so they have all the fancy character shadings and nicely painted backrounds
Sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement looks bad
Sometimes when you let the computer take over the movements they become robotic
I really don't think any of these animators know what in betweeners are
<br /><br />The stories are badly written, and some of the lines they give the heroes are horrible
Why, for example, when heroes are teamed together for the first time they start fighting with each other? In Secret Wars, it was a lame excuse that got them in disagreement
I can see if the hero was dark, unknown and mysterious - like the Punisher, but why the Thing and Iron Man can't hold their tempers with each other is ridiculous, then the Torch joins in
This is just another of the later comic trends to get heroes to square off at each other for a few seconds because 'everyone' wants to see that stuff
Give them a better reason to fight and maybe it can be pulled off, but "Hey what are you doing here" and "You don't tell me what to do" are LAME reasons
Another badly written scene is in The Wedding where Harry Osborne unmasks himself to spoil Peter's wedding
<br /><br />Last, but certainly not least, is what another critic calls Juvenile Violence - meaning no punches at all
In Secret Wars, the Lizard carefully ducked the Thing's charge
But the Thing punches the bad guys across an entire block in the comics
He must simply revert to lifting heavy things and subduing a bad guy by grabbing hold of him in the cartoons
Sure, these cartoons were not made strictly for us adults but for kids under 12
That's why they can't have punching, because mommy and daddy don't believe in that type of violence
But you can blow things up, these cartoons will include that
As a kid before political correctness came in fashion I saw cartoons punching each other
What's wrong with a punch to the chops? Is there really less violence in the world today because those slick and crafty new cartoons took out the punch? I find this the most insulting of all when I watch the new stuff
They've written out "the punch' because we could all hurt ourselves
<br /><br />Kids, enjoy these cartoons all you want, I've seen enough
Rent it it's really good) is the worst of the bunch (Pretty stiff competition but he is amazingly god-awful
) One would be hard pressed to find a home movie participant with such an awkward camera presence
The film actually screeches to a stunning painful halt when he is on the screen
<br /><br />Not that the film actually has any redeeming qualities for Mr
It is filmed with a home movie camera and by the looks of things a pretty old one complete with attached boom mike
Come on there has to be some shovelware a five year old computer could use that could clean up this picture
Throw in bizarre stock footage pictures of autopsy's and aircraft carrier takeoffs and this is one visually screwed up picture
The autopsy pictures are interjected the way Italian cannibal films interject those god-awful real life animal killings
And the Navy footage is supposed to be some anti war statement (Cause we know all the bloodthirsty maniacs join the Navy) What in the world is Lion's Gate is doing releasing this garbage? It would embarrass Troma
The plot is about the Zodiac Killer (Last seen in Dirty Harry
Rent it it's really good) Somebody gets shot in the stomach in LA and the cops assume the Zodiac Killer is back? Uh-huh
What can you expect from a movie that doesn't know that DSM IV is a book not a psychiatric disorder and where the young killer older man relationship resembles that of a congressional page and closeted congressman? Yeah eighties haircuts and production values meet a Nambla subplot
This can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you don't take it seriously
It is a bit dated and the effects are lame, but it is so enjoyable
And the ending, which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome
Predictable, but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat
Don't even give this film a chance and you will love it
Susan George is fun to watch and yes, she does appear naked
Her daughter isn't quite worth putting up with, but she does get attacked by giant crabs
As a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I give it a 7
In the small American town of Meadowvale Dr
Anthony Blake (David Gale, the IMDb listing for this character is wrong it's definitely Dr
Blakely) is the director and founder of the famed 'Psychological Research Institute' and also host's a local T
show to hypnotise the viewers and make them commit acts of violence
Blake has the help of a large brain with an evil face that uses it's spinal cord as a tail thingy
Usually the brain is just sitting in a tank, eats mice and the odd bad actor, each time it eats someone it gets much bigger
Meanwhile at the local high-school gifted but troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski (Tom Bresnahan) has been caught putting Sodium down the toilets
Blake at the PRI for help with his attitude and behavioural problems
Blake hooks Jim up to, well something I'm not actually sure what
This whatever it is, is attached to the brain
At first Jim is able to resist the brain's mind control
The brain feels that Jim is a threat to itself and it's plans
Once out of the PRI Jim starts having bizarre hallucinations and crashes his car
Jim makes it to his waitress girlfriend Janet (Cynthia Preston as Cyndy Preston) but is handed back to Dr
Blake's assistant Verna (George Buza) soon after by Officer Marks (Harry Booker)
The brain wants to kill Jim because he is the only one capable of withstanding it's mind control techniques, and with 'Independent Thinkers' going national the brain doesn't want anything or anyone to stop it's evil plan for world domination! Jim quickly realises that the brain is controlling the entire town and he alone must stop the brain, before it takes over the world!<br /><br />Directed by Ed Hunt who calls himself Edward Hunt here, the Brain wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be
Don't get me wrong as it certainly isn't great either
The script by Barry Pearson tries a stab at satire with the brain washing and mind control by T
It moves along at a fair pace and isn't too boring
No explanation is given for the existence of the brain at all, it's just there and that's it we have to accept it
The story is a little choppy and never fully explores one single element, there's the T
mind control, the brain itself, Jim being hunted by the police & his misbehaviour and various other little bits and pieces here and there including a bizarre revelation regarding Dr
Production wise this film looks cheap, and probably was cheap
The acting isn't great but I've seen worse, and what is David Gale doing in this? In fact this role is similar to Gale's role in Re-Animator (1985) even down to his character's deaths in both films
The brain itself at first sits in a tank and starts to grow whenever it eats someone and by the end it is pretty big
It doesn't look particularly good and isn't scary or creepy, just cheap
There's no blood or gore in it apart from a blink and you'll miss it decapitation
Blake's assistant Vivian (Christine Kossak as Christine Kossack) before she gets eaten
The brain had a certain entertainment value for me but I would think most people would dislike it
Maybe worth a watch if you can see it on T
This is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers
Some of the acting reminded me of John Waters' early offerings
Perhaps I should take that back--I don't want to insult Waters' ability as a director/storyteller
<br /><br />I particularly loved the lawyer taking about the "full faith and credibility" clause
It's "full faith and credit," by the way!<br /><br />This also reminds me of "The Conrad Boys," where the main actor is also the writer, director, film editor, etc
Those sort of multi-involved undertakings such as that are probably best left to very seasoned film professionals who would have the technical ability (albeit a stunt, some might say) to pull something off like that
Unless you are already familiar with the pop stars who star in this film, save yourself the time and stop reading this review after you've reached the end of the next sentence
<br /><br />FORGET YOU EVER STUMBLED UPON THIS FILM AND GO WATCH SOMETHING ELSE
<br /><br />But if you insist on reading, consider: <br /><br />Lame vehicle for Japanese teen idol pretty-boys featuring nonsensical, convoluted "plot" that drags out for an insufferable amount of time until you're ready to scream
<br /><br />Nothing in this film makes sense
It's an endless series of people expressing various emotions, from joy to anger, from happiness to tragedy, FOR NO GOOD REASON
We can obviously see something incredibly "dramatic" is happening, but we just don't GIVE A CRAP WHY 'cause there's no backstory
<br /><br />By the time this film is over, you will be sick and tired of these stupid, lanky, girly stars' faces
You'll be revolted at having spent all this time watching them smile, sneer, cry, look mysterious, be "serious," and any other pointless expression they slap on their faces
<br /><br />That some moron would ever go so far as to refer to this piece of insipid trash as being the "soul" of any of its "actors" should prove to you beyond the shadow of a doubt what the trailer and countless adoring comments on this site will not tell you: <br /><br />Only the "converted," mindless minions will like this film, the majority of them teenage girls with a pathological adoration for anything androgynous
<br /><br />Unless you're one of these mindless "fans," stay the hell away from this abomination
You know how everyone jokes about the acting in porno movies? Well if you've always found the plot line of a porn to captivate your interest, then this movie is for you
Or if that analogy is not to your liking, imagine you and your drunk roommate found a movie camera abandoned on a park bench
-Horrible acting -bad camera work -Music done on a casio keyboard This movie has it all, and more
For those who are masochists in the crowd, this is a premiere piece for your collection
<br /><br />All I can figure is that the only people to submit reviews for this dripping pile of movie, were people who 'starred' in it
<br /><br />Their movie career is over before it started
Well, Jesus of Montreal is basically an intelligent movie
The actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay
But, although I was very interested in the topic and like to think and discuss about religion (I am an atheist), it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end
Why is this movie so incredibly boring? I don't know
It just is and so it is not recommendable
This is surely one of the worst films ever made and released by a major Hollywood studio
The dialog is written in clichés; you can complete a great many sentences in the script because of this
The acting is ridiculously bad, especially that of Rod Cameron
The "choreography" is silly and wholly unerotic
One can only pity the reviewer who saw 23-year-old Yvonne's dance as sexual; it's merely very bad choreography
The ballet scene in the film's beginning is especially ludicrous
If you are into bad movies and enjoy laughing at some of Hollywood's turkeys, this is for you
I bought the colorized version on VHS, making the movie even worse
Yvonne's heavy makeup, when colored, has her looking like a clown all the time
I ended up watching this whole (very long) movie because I was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivity of it
It seems difficult to believe that so many famous people (Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, John Gielguld, Vittorio de Sica, etc
) would have willingly participated in this farce
But maybe in 1968 people really *were* so naive? The plot seems written by some confused Latin American Marxist priest with an agenda
There is a superpower conflict and the Russians are actually the good guys, with the Communist Party General Secretary being a nice and spiritual man, who, suddenly, after 20 years, sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a Siberian gulag
The priest then promptly becomes the Pope by a series of coincidences
We are allowed to see the secret Vatican papal voting process which is portrayed in the most hillariously pious form you can possibly imagine
<br /><br />Meanwhile, the communists in China achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their country to death
To solve this minor hiccup on the relentless shining path towards communism they want to start a nuclear war (in order to justly distribute the Western capitalist riches to the poor workers of China)
<br /><br />Our good old comrade General Secretary gets a bit worried and calls the Pope just before his coronation to ask him to broker peace
They meet with the Chinese leader comrade Peng who looks and acts like a 15 year old boy
You will roll on the floor laughing about what people in 1968 thought the Chinese looked like
Comrade Peng demands that the Western capitalists must pay (which is quite logical after all, don't capitalists always have to pay for the madness of the socialists?), and that the Pope needs to sacrifice something, too, for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice
<br /><br />So when the Pope gets crowned in Rome, he pledges the entire wealth of the Catholic church world-wide to feed our poor Chinese brethren in Christ
And thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaust
<br /><br />Apart from this, there are also some minor sub-plots, which, alas, provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie
<br /><br />By the way, Anthony Quinn looks quite unlikely as a Pope
He is much more plausible as Zorba the Greek
Being a big fan of Corman's horror movies I expected from his western a bit more than I got
I had almost as many laughs as watching Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles
<br /><br />See the spectacle of mobile tire tracks on the prairie of the old west
You can kill time by counting them if there happens to be an otherwise boring scene going on
And the horses seem to have gears in them too, considered the fast-forward chases
See also the swinging bar room queens of the traditional wild west saloon doing a number that reminds of a certain fashionable dance from 1920's, here decades before the style was invented
Hope the saloon around them won't crumple
<br /><br />In the middle of all this mayhem the main actors do a decent job
Ireland, Garland and Hayes are all truly fine
A special praise for them for doing the best they could with the material that seems mostly having been lifted from 'Johnny Guitar', but doesn't quite impress the same way
But there is really nothing wrong with a laughable western like this
Just like a really bad old horror movie, it might fail one way but succeeds to give joy anyway
That is one of the reasons Corman's work appeals to me and that is why I dare to recommend you to experience this movie if you get the chance
I'm sorry, but even TJ Hooker's Adrian Zmed couldn't save this sequel
I went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original
Then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene (notice that this is the only movie that Patricia Birch directs); and I sadly realized they were trying to be serious
I did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang, having lost their "wheels" due to their gambling habits in the original Grease, were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie
Being shamed by that putz character Carrington, I'd hate to see what they would resort to later: maybe Mopeds?<br /><br />I also never bought the hackneyed theme: hunky-Australian-boy-can't-fit-into-Outsiders-dominated-school-ergo-goes-for -tough-guy-with-stupid-biker-helmet-look
<br /><br />So, it looks like you CAN ruin a good thing by placing a bubble-gum smacking Michelle Pfeiffer in a musical
The only thing I took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it
There's enough star power in THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS to create another galaxy, yet the final product is pretty debatable
The film and its messages are very noble, and I think perhaps most would agree with them
(Liberal Democracy good, violent fascist regime bad; open-mindedness good, racism bad, etc)
Unfortunately, we're battered from head to toe with these, and as much subtlety is used as I've described them
<br /><br />Ultimately, we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities
It radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated "pro" wrestling match
<br /><br />Jeremy Irons plays the patron, a man of many contradictions
Meryl Streep as his gifted bride and Glenn Close, as her sister in law
When the camera stays with these folks, the movie tends to move, and is quite enjoyable
Unfortunately, THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS engages with simply way too many subplots, and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets
We don't get to know them, hence we don't get to care for them
<br /><br />If Bille August, the director and screenwriter (from Isabel Allende's book) had either lengthened the film or snipped a few characters, this film might have worked completely
As it stands, it was a nice try, with nice messages, and a bonecrushing yawnfest
The statistics in this movie were well researched
There is no doubt about it! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this movie got the praise that it got
But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this movie, there are political tidbits and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the movie
<br /><br />Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a man of integrity who not only talks the talk, but walks the walk as well
When Carter thought we needed to conserve energy, he turned down the thermostat in the White House and got warm by wearing a sweater
<br /><br />Al Gore tells us that we have to conserve energy and claims that we are creating global warming while he travels around in his own private jet
How much energy does his jet use and how much more pollution does his jet create? How much energy does it take to heat Gore's swimming pool behind his mansion? It would be nice if we could conserve electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used
But if we did, the power company would react to a 50% reduction of energy by calling it a "50% loss in revenue" and recouping their losses by raising the rates by 50%
So "just turning it off" would not be a very good idea
<br /><br />This movie is a veiled appeal to allow Big Goivernment to take control of everything, in the name of saving planet earth, that is
I remember back when I was little when I was away at camp and we would campout under the stars
There was always someone there that would have a good story to tell that involved the woods that surrounded us and they would always creep me out
Well, when I found Wendigo at the library, I checked it out hoping to be one of those films that had a supernatural being haunting people in the woods much like the stories that were told at camp
Well, much to my dismay, I was so far from the truth
The story starts of when a family of three is driving to their winter cabin, which looks like your normal suburban home and nothing like a cabin in the woods, and they run into a deer
Well, it seems the local rednecks were actually hunting this particular deer and are pretty upset at our city folk
The movie spends far too much time following the families everyday activities instead of getting to the point of the film
It wasn't until about the last 15 minutes that we actually have some action involving the "wendigo
" My suggestion is that you stay very far away this film
It will leave you wanting your hour and a half back
For years Madonna has tried to prove not only herself, but the public eye, that she can act
Unfortunately, trying too hard while failing to shed her own persona doesn't mix well
<br /><br />She seems to fare better when she's NOT the star of any movie: if you watch her in supporting performances in DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN (1985) or A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN (1992), she actually comes off looking good
Since the story revolves on other actors, the weight of the expectation is taken off her shoulders by default
<br /><br />The trouble starts when she is asked to be the star of a movie, regardless the genre
Being the focus of a plot that needs to be told in a visual way, whether it be good, mediocre or plain awful, she has to emote in ways that are akin to an actual movie performance as opposed to a video performance
This is the crucial difference between Madonna and, let's say, Bette Davis, or Meryl Streep
The latter two, even if the movie were to fail (because the visual storytelling lacked some effectiveness in having us relate to it, or because the script fell short, or because the actress per se was just not at her moment), there would be an extra something in their performances that would elevate the movie from being a complete bomb
Both Davis and Streep have had their share: Bette, having a longer career than Streep, in such fare as BUNNY O'HARE (1971) and WICKED STEPMOTHER (1989); Streep in SHE-DEVIL (1989)
But at least there's been that naturalism in the way both attacked their roles that made us forget the banality of the movie and watch the performance
<br /><br />Madonna, on the other hand, not being an especially gifted actress capable of really letting us in on her ability to convey a persona other than herself, fares much worse, and even in the hands of someone as Woody Allen in SHADOWS AND FOG (1992), an inferior classic, she in her pat screen time seems stilted and a little stiff, maybe even nervous, as if she were aware of the cameras and crew and just couldn't let go
<br /><br />So here she tries yet once again to prove she can act in what is essentially a two-character movie
Guy Ritchie, more known for action movies filled in masculine energy, seems as adrift telling a story closer to someone of the likes of Michaelangelo Antonioni or Ingmar Bergman, who could tell a tale of two people with incredible ease
And at 89 minutes, the events which take place happen in such an unconvincing way that when the final half hour comes along and the story takes a dramatic turn, it doesn't feel sincere
From being an absolute witch with no redeeming values to suddenly being in love, this has to be the most unconvincing 180 degree turn since Fay Dunaway's Laura suddenly discovered her passion for Tommy Lee Jones in THE EYES OF LAURA MARS (1978)
Equally unconvincing is Adriano Giannini's nasty turn around the middle of the movie -- it lacks any humor and feels genuinely psychopathic -- and when he gives in to Madonna's love, it's too quick to be believed
Filming this in slow music and a visual montage of lovemaking and beautiful scenery doesn't enhance or add upon this "transformation" from what would have been a story of survival between to unlikeable characters to a love story where both discover each other
<br /><br />Trying to have an unsatisfying ending works against the movie as well -- it only makes it drag, bog it down, and when Madonna has to be filmed going from hope to devastation in a tight close-up, it feels she's trying too hard
Many an actress have done better in conveying so much doing so little
Hers is a performance more suited to acting styles of the late 20s, early 30s where posturing compensated as acting a part or an emotion
<br /><br />Could the movie have been better? Of course
There are a myriad of ways to have filmed it in a way that would leave the viewer feeling that these people could at least hope to see each other again -- it's been done before, in OVERBOARD (1987), for example
It could have had an existential undertone in which two very different people have to rely on each other but not necessarily change (to ensure a moral tone)
Much dialog and unnecessary erotic scenes could have been spared for a more "silent" film look -- as in PERSONA (1966)
It could have even been something of a thriller, providing that the Giannini character have a mean streak as Billy Zane had in DEAD CALM (1989)
Even if it would have been done as a sex farce it would have worked better for Madonna as the over the top, uber-control freak getting her comeuppance
But with its mean streaked humor, without at least a glimpse of her character having a softer side that hides behind a mask of bitchdom, and without really defining Giannini's own character, this becomes another misfire trying to look like a battle of the sexes
The original Out of Towners was manic and very funny, of course they used the script written by Neil Simon
For some reason Neil Simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again
Even the audience I was with never laughed
The direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i
They announce it is a lighting ceremony for New York, well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging Goldie & Steve do a bit of slap stick
Why isn't Goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie
You will also notice every close up of Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens)
I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, that's if you want to laugh
I was so disgusted by this film, I felt obligated to warn off others
This film has no story, plot or hint of purpose
The film starts after the standard "lets be scary" movie intro, which by now every film watcher has become accustomed
So we can ignore the beginning completely
We are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better off watching static
(Unless you have seen white noise - EEK) Acting is a DISGRACE and all of them should return to the travelling pantomime from where they came
Having said that, even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely watch able
Their poor performances merely contribute to the disaster
Senseless violence and what I can only assume is the written word of yet another junked up "eccentric" writer, who probably considers himself to be an artist, has resulted in a film which will test your patience
It was not until my fellow watcher turned to me and said, "We have been watching this for 45 mins" did I realise that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag
Clearly something was missing and unfortunately it wasn't the audience
Rather than suggest what the film is missing, let me tell you what it has: Dumb Blonde (surprise surprise), Victims, bad-monster-guy-thing, about 2 mins of storyline which is stretched over hours, days, weeks, months
<br /><br />Want a silver lining? Well, the blonde girl is a bit saucy looking in some of the scenes, but expect to want to see her face ripped off for the rest of the film
A Christmas Story Is A Holiday Classic And My Favorite Movie
So Naturally, I Was Elated When This Movie Came Out In 1994
I Saw It Opening Day and Was Prepared To Enjoy Myself
The Anticipation that Rang True In A Christmas Story Is Curiously Missing from This mess
A Red Ryder BB Gun Is Better to get than a chinese top
Charles Grodin Is Good but the Buck Stops There
I'm Chinese, so I thought everything was totally wrong
The only thing right about Chinese history in the movie was when Wendy's mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded ShiHuangDi
I also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake
Many of the actors and actresses were not very great
Some of the jokes that were supposedly "funny" were really stupid
I think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it could get
Disney has really got to get more information about Chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie
Watch this movie if you want to waste some time
Two days after seeing this thing, I'm still in agony over HAVING seen it
It's so bad, you have to wonder how anyone could write this tripe, much less allow it to be loose on the general public
Stilted acting, a leading man who looks like he's sleepwalking, and Alison Eastwood embarrassing herself
The action is indicative of low budget movie making, which means it is painfully bad
The plot? Well, if you were 6 years old, then you could have written this movie
Simplistic, idealistic, and just plain lame
I watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of Sophia Loren
I'm a person who they call a Cultural Barbarian
Rambo is more my kind of movie, action, kills, blood, horror
If you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague
No one dies, no action, no nudity, nothing of the kind
Let me give you a résumé in a few sentences
It starts out with 5 minutes in black and white Nazi propaganda
Every Italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of Hitler, except for a housewife, an anti fascist and a caretaker
The housewife who is cheated by her husband, meets the anti fascist
She falls in love with him, wants to make love to him, but the anti fascist is gay
Despite of this they make love with each other
At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book from her gay lover, and the guy himself is deported by agents
That short enough? The guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself, to save the audience from this atrocity
On a side note my sister loved this movie
I caught this movie at a small screening held by members of my college's gaming club
We were forewarned that this would be the "reefer madness" of gaming, and this movie more than delivered
<br /><br />Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man re-starting his college career after "resting" for a semester
What we, the viewer, find out as the movie progresses, is that Robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role-playing game called "Mazes and Monsters," a game that he gets re-acquainted with after a gaming group recruit him for a campaign
<br /><br />This movie is laughable on many, many levels
One scene features the group "gaming by candlelight," which is probably the best way I can describe it
While I'm sure that this was meant to be "cultish" in some way, as most gamers know, it's horribly inaccurate
Most role-play sessions are done in well-lit rooms, usually over some chee-tohs and a can of soda
<br /><br />The acting, while not Oscar-caliber, isn't gut-wrenchingly awful either
This is one of Tom Hanks's first roles, and Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party were still a year or two over the horizon
The supporting cast, while not very memorable, still hand forth decent performances
<br /><br />Mainly the badness lies in the fact that it was a made-for-TV movie that shows the "dangers of gaming" Worth a view if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night
at least to me for probably all the wrong reasons
I have never seen the original so can't compare the two
<br /><br />This movie reminded me of that weird Christopher Reeve movie Village of the Damned
THe two movies have different plots, but that creepy disgusted feeling and unwanted comedy exist in both
<br /><br />The wicker man is suppose to be a mystery/thriller/men please don't anger the women movie
I don't know the whole pagan thing and sacrifice was a little off
<br /><br />Nicholas Cage, his glorious bad self goes to a secluded Island called Summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long lost fiancée who claims her daughter has been taken and hidden by fellow islanders
<br /><br />Cage is a police officer and being the weary policeman he is he goes to the semi uncharted island leaving no word of his whereabouts to anyone who is located in the real world
<br /><br />Things get weirder when the large Amish-esquire women who populate the island snarl at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl
His fiancée is no help who seems to be elusive and weary the whole time
Cage stays on the Island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and he is the lucky man tricked to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the islands sick harvest festival
<br /><br />In this movie males do not fare so well
A sick twisted display of feminism? <br /><br />I found the movie laughable at times particularly when cage punches some women and runs around in a bear suit
I think there were too many potholes in this movie
I find the whole concept of angry women secluding themselves on an island without any care for males quite entertaining, but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just weird
While most women have had some jerk hurt and anger them this is clearly a form of sexism
I would have turned the movie off in disgust if the roles were reversed
This movie is something to watch maybe just once or twice
It is NOT a thriller it should be categorized as just strange
What a disgrace! I was checking this out hoping it would be an undiscovered James Garner gem and what a stinker it turned out to be! The production quality was fine, but the plot was undeniably lame and I can honestly say that I am only a couple hours older and a lot dumber now
The movie really had no redeeming qualities and if this kind of stuff keeps coming out, it will give Hallmark a bad name
For those of you who insist on knowing what it was about, it's about nothing, and in this case, it's not a good thing
We are subjected to watching one old ornery woman who is one of the dumbest creatures ever to roam the earth, who happens to be married to a real sweetheart who is probably the only person alive that could put up with her
She drags him through one mess after another, gets him into one embarrassing situation after another, and is proud of herself the whole time
What a relief that was! Not worth the time it would take to watch it, so do yourself a favor and skip this one, you'll be glad you did if you knew how bad this one really is
I saw Creep and thought, 'Oooh, this is getting interesting' several times
Yet somehow the interesting plot lines wound up unexplained or ignored, like they never happened
The lead character was irritating throughout the movie, and at one point my fella and I both shouted that we wanted her to die
There are some genuinely spooky/scary moments, but these are grossly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed the hell out of me
It's another one of those horror movies that crops up and intrigues you for a while, but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the movie makers were trying to achieve
<br /><br />The one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy, but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character you know you're on to a loser
This film's premise is so simple and obvious that only a Texas millionaire high on oil fumes and whiskey would have a problem understanding it if someone shouted it across the proverbial parking lot
In summary: the oil business is in cahoots with The Government (or Gummint if you prefer), the Gummint is in cahoots with Middle Eastern despots, and the CIA is a singular festering pool of double dealing sons-of-(insert word) willing to toe any line that comes their way
The only people that get done over are the good ones, like Mr Clooney ("Bob")
Oh, and terrorism is a result of the poverty which globalization creates when wicked multinationals stalk the world looking for a tasty takeover or three
That really fits to the profiles of the well-heeled 9/11 perpetrators
<br /><br />In Syriana this facile tissue of political half-truths and Hollywood holograms is stirred up in a repugnant vermicelli of story strands that twist, turn and whirl through the gloopy circumlocutions of their own insignificance until the poor viewer is left alone with the conclusion that: <br /><br />1
the "director" (good joke) should never be let near a camera again <br /><br />2
people like Clooney and Hurt might know how to act, but they sure don't know how to pick a script <br /><br />3
if you want to see a film that deals with corruption in big business and the state, go and see Claude Chabrol's "L'ivresse du pouvoir", which is insightful, funny and brilliantly acted
<br /><br />Empty, doom-laden sententious piffle spun out to evening-ruining length
Boring children's fantasy that gives Joan Plowright star billing but little to do
Frankie wants to be a ballerina and a baseball player (yuk) while best-friend Hazel runs for mayor---she's 13! Totally pedestrian in every way, plus the added disadvantage of syrupy performances by the girls as well as the baseball boys
Certainly a lesser effort for Showtime---no limits
those that occasionally result when people (even talented people) get together with good intentions to produce a movie and for whatever reason it turns out to be a disaster
Movies like "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes", "Plan 9 from Outer Space", "Manos-Hands of Fate", and "Heavens Gate", etc
<br /><br />So, when I heard that this movie, "Rachel's Attic", was considered by many people to be the single worst film of the decade, naturally I just HAD to see it
<br /><br />Boy, do I regret that decision
it is SO bad that it is not even as enjoyable as the usual bad movie
are even worse than a low budget porno film: the sound is utterly horrible, the "plot" is completely incomprehensible, the "acting" is laughable
it is a complete waste of everyone's time and money
At least the porno film has porno to break up the monotony, while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy squeezing a rotten apple, and a "mad hatter's" tea party
many "scenes" take place in semi or complete darkness, which is probably just as well
The "writer-director" (I use the terms loosely), David Tybor, tries to get kinky with bondage scenes
but the results would be laughable, if they weren't so pathetic
There is some nudity, but it is of such abysmal quality that it actually acts as a sexual suppressant
I could go on forever and not do justice to all the flaws and shortcomings of this truly awful waste of film
<br /><br />For the love of god, avoid this train wreck
I know that despite (or perhaps because of) my negative comments, you may still be tempted to see if this piece of trash is really as bad as I claim it to be
it's even worse than I have said, and you will absolutely, positively regret the experience (and expense, if you waste your money on a purchase or rental)
This is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made - even for Fellini
About the only one more bizarre is his SATYRICON
This is a two and a half hour romp through a strange nightmarish world of decadence, opulence and sexual challenge
Sutherland makes a curiously unappealing Casanova and the odd goings on in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover's autobiography fail to engage the viewer
The art direction and costume design are however OUTSTANDING
The Academy missed on not even nominating the former but did itself justice by rewarding an OSCAR for the latter
Also nominated (oddly) was the disjointed, pointless and almost inacessible screenplay
Go figure!! The film on video is only 150 minutes, 16 minutes short of the original running time
Well, I suppose the good news concerning William Winckler's 2001 opus, "The Double-D Avenger," is that it manages to unite three of Russ Meyer's mammarian marvels--Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven de la Croix--in one picture
(I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were busy the week they shot this thing
or else managed to see a copy of the script in advance!) The bad news, though (and there's plenty of it), is that this film--if it can even be called that, having been shot straight to video--is a complete misfire, a total abortion, an out-and-out atrocity, an absolute abomination, and truly one of the worst pictures that I have ever seen
Look no further for the lamest superhero movie ever made! The plot here, such as it is, deals with Kitten gaining superpowers after fellating the rare cockazilla plant in South America to cure her breast cancer (oy), and later battling a trio of megalunged bikini dancers back in L
Too bad that every lame boob joke trotted out falls completely (you should pardon the expression) flat, that there is ZERO actual nudity in the film at all (other than some old photos of Kitten in her heyday), and that some shaving cream and a papier-mache boulder are the sum total of the special FX
The Meyer gals here are a bit long in the tooth/saggy in the chest, to put it kindly, although Sheri Dawn Thomas, as bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!), does manage to, uh, stand out nicely
So why have I given this juvenile, unfunny, failed embarrassment of a movie 2 stars instead of 1? To be succinct: Joe Bob Briggs
His voice-over commentary in the special features of the DVD I just watched is absolutely hilarious, especially when he pulls out around 100 synonyms for the word "breast" from the 1,000+ on his Web site's "Canonical Hooters List
" The man is a national treasure, and he manages to upgrade this skeet of a disc to coaster status
This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! There were people leaving the theatre, others were falling asleep (ok, it was a late night show)
This is a no-sense movie, one of those who can make you never want to see an out of mainstream picture again
I would love to watch the making-off of this movie as I am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such garbage
Do they laugh when they create all this ridiculous stuff or do they actually think they're doing something interesting? I wonder
The soundtrack is awful apart from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous Bjork album
Even if you're a fan of Bjork's music, stay home
The little, tiny, pieces of nice music are no reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this torture
i watched it while i worked at home writing emails and answering the phone -- i ONLY watched it because i hoped the "revenge" part would be good
needless to say, the revenge and the forced plot twists were not worth the emails during which they were watched
in fact, i'm not even sure what happened at the end any more
the acting was as bad as re-enactment scenarios on the "FBI Files" show -- by far, the worst re-enactments (really only "Arrest and Trial" can possibly be as bad at re-enactments)
i didn't even know that the leading man was in Third Eye Blind until i looked the movie up here on IMDb, but its obvious why he hasn't made any movies since
I remember the days in which Kim Basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who adorned movies with typical characters of dumb Blondie,romantic interest or damsel in danger
But,everything changed when she won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress for her role in the excellent movie L
Confidential,and I think I was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance
However,after that moment,her career did not follow the ideal path
Sure,the prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies (like People I Know or The Door in the Floor),but we have never seen her again on a substantial character
The movie While She Was Out does nothing to put her on that situation; and it is not only that her character is not too tasty,but also that the movie is really crappy
The screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basic
However,Basinger brings some conviction to her character,and that makes this poor movie to win a few points
This movie is full of clichés and generic villains
The work of director Susan Montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainly,because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone
The ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous
I do not recommend While She Was Out at all
This film commits the capital sin of being boring
A shame that even a talented director, Desplechin, could not muster a decent performance out of a bleakly-talented actress, Phoenix, Esther Kahn lacks the substance to convey a very concise and clear plot
In an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of an actor's plight, the performance and presentation is too contrived and poorly executed to draw any compassion from the viewer
In an overly long running time, the redundancy of Esther's struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the storyline into a frail frame of a disastrous display
The content is incoherent and gratuitous as Phoenix struggles to carry out Desplechin's instruction, just as Esther is supposedly trying to do the same
Never feeling a convincing victory over Esther's pain, we never feel a victory in Phoenix's talent
I guess I've seen worse films, but that may be becuz I'm so jaded by how standard these bad horror movies are
The killer monster thing is really really bad, basically its a guy in some kind of green body suit
There is much worse acting as far as B movie go, but don't think for a second this was anything stellar, hell no
It actually did have a plot with substance, but was still pretty stupid
Basically its just a bad low budget horror movie
But at least its not as bad as titanic, that movie sucks balls, this one just sucks
The blood looks really fake in this movie
Thats one complaint I have about all the horror of the new millinium, low grade gore, looks stupid
A good gruesome death scene with really fake blood is so stupid
I gave this a four purely out of its historical context
It was considered lost for many years until it popped up out of the blue on Showtime in the early nineties
<br /><br />Moe is the straight man and Larry and Curly act as a duo
I guess it had something to do with working on a ranch
I'm not quite sure because the plot was so minimal nothing really sticks in my memory
I vaguely remember it being a western musical comedy
Even the Stooge's seem to be going through the motions
Overall there's nothing much really to recommend here
<br /><br />If you're not a Stooge fan then don't bother
If you are a Stooge fan, then stick with the shorts
Having seen the hot Eliza Dushku in the pretty good Wrong Turn, I decided to pick this one up instead of Return of the Living Dead, of all movies
Haven't seen that one yet, but, considering it is one of the most highly acclaimed horror movies ever, safe to say I made the wrong choice
There is simply nothing to recommend this movie, and I am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut
It didn't even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer or Valentine or Urban Legend
It simply made no sense, held no excitement, had very little interesting acting or compelling writing
The release date was apparently put off numerous times for about a year running, and the reason is obvious
The whole movie comes off as a bunch of meaningless scenes thrown together haphazardly, to meaningless effect
Get Wrong Turn instead, if you want to see Dushku
I would like to see a movie with her and the super-hot Elisabeth Harnois--but I don't think even that would have made this movie watchable
Casey Affleck, so promising in Good Will Hunting, is awful here--he seems to lack both intelligence and guts
the writing of the journalists and the required over eager reckless press officer and sobbing grandma was ham-fisted and cliché ridden
<br /><br />I cant blame the actors, but surely someone must have said "are you joking I cant say this!"<br /><br />This episode had a press perspective and police perspective, while the police perspective was standard enough, the press perspective and characterization was overdrawn exaggerated and at points insultingly unbelievable
<br /><br />I notice that this was an HBO co production, if so then perhaps the sledgehammer stereotypes can be explained in that light,<br /><br />I was completely cringing during the press conference scene
it lacked any credibility and did not remotely ring true
40 minutes into the first episode and I am still waiting for the suspense
the 2008/9 production with these characters is far better and more suspenseful even if the crime is over the top
<br /><br />This story had unforgivable moments which can only be described as staggeringly unbelievable
<br /><br />For a press officer to start a press conference without an investigating officer present to take press questions
<br /><br />so unbelievable it felt like amateur hour
<br /><br />I then began looking for Journalists called "Scoop" and for Perry White to make an appearance
<br /><br />I saw the 2009 Hunter before "five days"made it to Australia, not realizing it was a prequel and was looking forward to Bonneville and McTeer going around again
You MUST be kidding!!!! Let's entertain the possibility that Parker Posey is really an actress, and not just some entry in the "quirk of the month club" of actors
Really, unless this is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek satire on David Mamet-- terse, confusing dialog delivered alternately in machine gun rapidity or monotone (think Ben Stein) blandness--or a flat out dry comedy; this film has got to be in the running for a Rotten Tomato Award---or worse
<br /><br />As if the stiff and uncomfortable Posey weren't enough, we've got the stiffer and even more uncomfortable Jeff Goldblum
There's more wood in this film than a toothpick factory
<br /><br />Adding to this already bizarre casting, are several other roles, all populated by forgettable actors, who look or sound like escapees from America's Next Top Model, Don Pardo, or even the kid, who pronounces the word "been" like "bean", which just brings our attention to the fact that there is so little to like about this film, we are analyzing his accent to guess if he's Canadian or not!! I think I laughed heartily in places that are supposed to be serious, and took seriously sections that are meant to be humorous
Even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature of Alarik Jans music for Mamet's "The House of Games"
If taken as a spoof, the film is almost droll; if taken seriously, just a self-conscious piece of drek
This HAS to be the worst movie I've ever attempted to watch
In the first 15 minutes, there wasn't anything to keep my interest in this movie
I was on vacation at the time, and had plenty of time to devote to a just-for-the-fun-of-it movie
The condo we were staying in had this movie in stock -- they must have got it from the $1 store or something
<br /><br />If you like Adam Sandler, this is nothing like any other movie he's made
This started with a bad premise and then just got worse
There's nothing even remotely funny in it
<br /><br />I've watched a lot of movies, including some I didn't care for
But if you decide to waste your time on this movie, don't say I didn't warn you
Another Priyadarshan/Vohra flick another movie that was seen for TP rather than actual desire, the only reason i did see this movie was the fact that the regulars were not there in this movie (Akshay Paresh and many others), but needless to say i had low expectations from this movie
<br /><br />I was happy with the casting in general except, Rajpal Yadav who once again annoys to no limit, he does however extract some laughs, but these were those standard slapstick non-original jokes, in fact this whole movie is like playing the dhol, I mean it takes hardly any talent to make loud noise, or even play the odd good beat on the dhol for a small time does it?? Its only those who can carry different beats in a nice sequential manner, for an extended period who are considered great
<br /><br />Which brings us to the other instrument, the Dumroo hardly requires any talent, it has no variations, and it may be enjoyable for a while the monkey dances (hmm sounds like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy), but its not a instrument that will entertain you for long or even get you dancing like the Dhol does
<br /><br />This movie was like the dhol and the dumroo being played, sometimes the Dhol was played sometimes the dumroo, sometimes both together, but mostly the Dumroo played alone and the monkey danced
And like any 24 year old sooner than later I got bored
<br /><br />The movie has some good Dhol (good) moments but after a while all i heard was the annoying Dumroo (entertaining initially, then tolerable then irritating), the large ordinary parts really ensure this movie is mainly good for a few funny clips on "MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA" (if you haven't watched it watch it on Filmy, it comes in the evenings and is really quite funny)
<br /><br />This movie had its moments, the actors did a fine job, except Rajpal Yadav (who can act though, I've seen him in Main Meri Patni) who annoys more than entertains, I've said it many time and I'll say it again I really think Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a fine career ahead of them in the multi-star comedies especially
<br /><br />Some scenes were really funny such as the aborted attempts to impress the girls father, the zany attempts to woo the girl and take her away from each other
<br /><br />But after this was over there was a failed attempt to make this movie into much more with a mystery added, this mean that once the girl was in, the following 45-60 mins was increasingly torturous, the climax was "SO BAD ITS ALMOST GOOD CATEGORY", I mean what were they thinking if you had to have tense ending at least make some attempt to make it palatable
<br /><br />The movie is also extremely predictable, there's hardly a scene you cant predict and you wont be breaking into spontaneous burst of laughter here, its more like you see it coming and almost start laughing before the gag
<br /><br />The movie follows a gradual decline throughout the movies except for the odd bump, down or up, and then rapidly tumbles downhill once they have made friends with the girl
<br /><br />Most of the really bad scenes were towards the end, one the movie tries to be more than a run of the mill comedy, also many of the jokes were very very stale and reeked of repetition, THE LAST 10-15 WAS ESPECIALLY DISTATEFULL AND COMPLETELY SPOILS THIS MOVIE
<br /><br />I didn't find Tanushree Datta quite the siren she was to play, and her acting talent is in serious question, especially in view of her non-appealing looks, if you cant be a HOT and cant act how much time can you survive
<br /><br />Technically also this movie was weak, with the constant female gaze and shoddy lighting and camera-work
<br /><br />The songs except the title track were no good either, when the songs played in the 2nd half I could feel the collective gasp from the audience
<br /><br />In all a movie that's just ordinary merely because of the cast, and the very low expectations
<br /><br />Avoiding it wont be a bad idea
<br /><br />And if it has to be watched watching it on TV for free or a very cheap matinée or something is a must, if you pay full multiplex rates you will feel disappointed
<br /><br />-s lots of stale jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, LAST 45 MINS AND LAST 15 MINS ESPECIALLY, bad technically, bad songs
<br /><br />+/-s tries to be more than what it was, not the regular cast (I'm happier for it), Tanushree Datta
<br /><br />+s some good scenes towards the beginning,title song, good acting and cast except RY
5/10 (I'm trying to be objective here, i don't like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie did meet my very low expectations, so I'm giving it the benefit of all doubts, on absolute terms this movie was not more than a 4
Gymkata is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made
This one is so awful it's fun to watch and laugh
Kurt Thomas clearly does not have a lucrative career in acting
But who can forget such memorable scenes as the high bar with chalk, the stone pommel horse or the five minute chase scene through the village of the crazies in slow motion
I don't think it was meant to be this bad, but who can tell
It's not art, but if you want something lite and fluffy that will make a good conversation, rent gymakta
Hail Bollywood and men Directors !<br /><br />Really this is the ultimate limit in utter sacrifice made by Indian Woman !!<br /><br />Viewing the current state of affairs in India where The wives are becoming more vicious day by day and are very possessive about their husbands - the Directors
also can be called Uncle Scars (refer movie The Lion King) came up with a very new concept on how both the kept and the wife can live together happily ever after sharing everything between themselves
including the spermikins !!<br /><br />Story line : Married couple - very happy - but accidentally a mishap happens and wife has a miscarriage - lost the foetus along with the capacity of ever becoming a mother !<br /><br />Now in in India, the in- laws usually drive away the daughter- in- law if she fails to give them an heir ! So the wife hits upon a major plan - surrogate mother
but the scientists intervened - "Sure artificial insemination" - NO said the artist (Director actually) - "Neighbourhood will come to know that the daughter - in - law is barren so they are going for surrogate mother !!<br /><br />Neighbours ! society !! gosh the same ones who watch Fashion TV day and night - watching girls between the age group of 14 to 40
al in bras and panties - well those neighbors suddenly take an upper hand in family planning and decision making !!<br /><br />SO the wife sends away her husband to a beer bar where girls are dancing on the stage - all mostly uneducated and illiterate - but men love such women as they can satisfy their egos a lot !<br /><br />He hires the lead dancer in the pub - asks her to bear his baby - in exchange for money - she agrees - she comes home - becomes pregnant - wife and kept - both co-exist in the same house - in the mean time the prostitute also gets a taste of household life - so much caring people around - she misses them all and cries silently !! In the mean time - no one in the family comes to know that the real daughter in law is roaming around with a pillow beneath her petticoat !!- the mother or other elderly people never took her for check-ups - nor did they try to feel the baby's movements in the womb !
Bringing so many stars in one movie is great
too many stories, too short and lacking really any sense
The frame reminded me of "All the invisible children" - a movie which I liked a lot
Compared to it, however, "Paris Je T'Aime" lacks the intriguing short story, which develops - starts and has its end
And it lacks the topic connecting all those - children
I do not find Paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short sketches together
Perhaps for people who know Paris it is interesting
An unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and horribly assaulted by a group of two-dimensional psycho thugs during a night-time encounter on a forest road in Shropshire, England
The man and woman who were assaulted plan and carry out a revenge attack on their attackers
<br /><br />Utterly repellent piece of voyeuristic trash, somehow masquerading as 'thought-provoking' drama, whilst actually coming across as sub-Michael Winner cr*p (you just know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would have been cast had it so easily have been made in the 1970s)
What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is appalling and devastating, yet Dan Reed somehow manages to rub the viewer's nose in every last glob of its sexual nastiness
His camera lingers hungrily on Anderson's naked body both during and after the assault, whilst the script leaves almost all the characters floundering in a turgid sea of two dimensional cliché
His script forces his characters to behave in such a way as to alienate the viewer further from the 'victims' by shoving more ghastly situations into their faces (Adams's attempted post-incident assaults on both Sophie and Alice; Alice's assault on Heffer AFTER his suicide-attempt confession)
<br /><br />The quandary comes from the central protagonists' performances - Dyer is a horrible actor, incapable of light and shade as the young male victim of the initial assault (he'll end up in Eastenders, mark my words), but Anderson is extraordinary
Even as the atrocious script forces her character to behave in depraved and ludicrous ways, she somehow delivers an extraordinarily compelling and complicated characterisation as a self-indulgent, arrogant hedonist who encounters such horrors and needs to retaliate
<br /><br />A vile and pointless film then, almost but not quite rescued by a compelling central female performance
PROBLEM CHILD is one of the worst movies I have seen in the last decade! This is a bad movie about a savage boy adopted by two parents, but he gets into trouble later
He can put a room on fire! It is a bad movie as much as BATTLEFIELD EARTH
if they gave me the option of negative numbers I'd use it
I went into the theaters expecting it to be horrible, and it somehow managed to exceed my expectations
<br /><br />The script was weak, the acting was painful
I wanted to walk out but my friend was driving and wanted to get her moneys worth, I think we were both disappointed
<br /><br />The growing of the breasts when the girls got their super power and changing of the hair color was just wrong
Eddie Izzard just seemed wrong for the part of super villain, he came off as oddly weak and silly
Jenny Johnsons (Uma Thurman) came off as psychotic and strange, as did Matt's (Luke Wilson) friend Vaughn (Rainn Wilson
I won't waste a whole lot of time of this one because as far as I'm concerned it isn't really a movie to start with, just a careless mish-mash of borrowed footage and embarrassingly amateurish new footage made solely for the purpose of pasting the whole mess together and call it a "Boogeyman" sequel
Literally 80% of this film is stolen from its far superior predecessor "The Boogeyman", a film that the writers of this garbage apparently didn't even bother to watch because they couldn't even get actress Suzanna Love's original character's name (Lacy) right
And to add insult to injury the killer is invisible in the original footage and visible in the new footage, apparently they think their audience is as stupid as they are
0 out of 10 and I wish IMDb's rating system went that low, the most callous and blatant attempt to rip off people's money I've even seen, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
I LOVE Don Knotts, let me just say that up-front! He is an enormous talent and the best at what he does, which is portray a nervous, lovably befuddled loser thrown into a position of authority
He is fabulous in this role as Roy Fleming, the Reluctant Astronaut, but the film is pretty dull, really, even though as a kid my brother and I delighted in watching this and his other films
It's still worth watching but really it's a film that is best enjoyed by children
I'd categorize it as 100% family-friendly and something you could sit down and watch with your kids on a family night
<br /><br />As with all of Knotts' films, there's a great cast of beloved character actors and you can't help but smile when Knotts gives one of his shaky, open-mouthed stares, no matter how old and jaded you are
<br /><br />From an adult perspective, one thing I think that is great about this film is how it captures NASA in the 1960s -- all the new modern buildings, the hope, the optimism, the future! And I was surprised at how suave and studly Leslie Neilsen was back then
Only complaint about the story is Roy's love interest, a rather threadbare, unlikeable woman who can't give him the time of day until he becomes a big shot -- if you're like me, you'll be hoping that he gives her the shove-off at the end
Beware -- you'll be whistling the theme tune for days after watching, it's that catchy
What an insult to the SA film industry! I have seen better SA films
The comments I read about Hijack Stories,by saying it is worthy of a ten out of ten is quite scary
LETS BOOST THEIR INDUSTRY BY SAYING NICE THINGS ABOUT THEIR WORK, EVEN THOUGH IT IS BAD
" We have the expertise to make good movies
Don't judge the film industry on what people say how great they think Hijack Stories is
We can tell great stories such as Cry the beloved Country and Shaka Zulu
Cry the beloved Country I'll give 9 out of 10
Great directing by Darryl, great acting by two great elderly actors, irrespective from where they are
It could only be people involved in the project who would give it high scores
I would've done the same if it was my movie
Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I have ever seen
They have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most-easily-offended viewers which for CBC means 85 year old farmers in Saskatchewan
The jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame I can't believe it
The performances are very hammy and over acted but I don't blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the CBC asked for and demanded
Very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as "controversial" well it is less controversial than the other boring CBC comedies like The Hour Has 22 Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer's Report
This film sold for one-dollar at Wal-Mart on a DVD and so I do not feel like I lost anything for watching this film, except my TIME
Enjoyed the acting of Tom Hanks, (Robbie Wheeling), who was very young looking and gave an outstanding performance considering it was a horrible script
The story is about college students who decided to play the game Mazes & Monsters, only in a very realistic setting
Robbie Wheeling has had problems in the past playing this game at other colleges and is advised by his parents to leave the game alone and get good grades
Robbie meets a very nice gal and has a romantic fling with her and once he starts playing the game, he stops making love to her and acts like a Monk
There are some scenes in the film which are taken running around the former World Trade Center and also in the Observation floor and Roof area
It is rather sad viewing this part of the film where so many human beings died because of evil in the world
This is not a very good film, except for Tom Hanks trying to keep the film above the sinking level of entertainment
From the poorly done animation, to the beyond bad acting
I am not sure at what point the people behind this movie said "Ok, looks good! Lets do it!" I was in awe of how truly horrid this movie was
At one point, which very may well have been the WORST point, a computer generated Saber Tooth of gold falls from the roof stabbing the idiot creator of the cats in the mouth
The villain of the movie was a paralyzed sabretooth that was killed within minutes of its first appearance
The other two manages to kill a handful of people prior to being burned and gunned down
Then, there is a random one awaiting victims in the jungle
Will there be a Part Two? God, for the sake of humans everywhere I hope not
From the power point esquire credits to the slide show ending
I was hoping for some sort of in-depth background information on the Apollo 11 mission and what I got was some decent interview material with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other people involved in the mission, linked by over-hyped disaster-predicting sensationalising voice-over in the worst tradition of TV production
<br /><br />If you could cut out the voice-over and change the spin of the program to a positive testament of how people can overcome setbacks to achieve a goal out of the ordinary then this could've been great - but I feel I've wasted about 45 minutes of my life whilst watching a 60 minute programme
"Well Chuck Jones is dead, lets soil his characters by adding cheap explosions, an American drawn anime knock off style, and give them superpowers"
"but sir?, don't we all ready have several shows in the works that are already like this? much less don't dump all over their original creators dreams"
"yes! and those shows make us a bunch of cash, and we need more!"
"but won't every man women and child, who grew up with these time less characters, be annoyed?"
"hay you're right! set it in the future, make them all descendent's of the original characters, and change all the names slightly
but not too much though, we still need to be able to milk the success of the classics"
<br /><br />Well that's the only reason I can think of why this even exists
If you look past the horrible desecration of our beloved Looney Toons, then it looks like an OK show
But then there is already the teen titan's, which is the same bloody thing
All the characters are dressed like batman, they drive around in some sort of ship fighting super villains, they have superpowers, only difference is they sort of talk like the Looney tunes and have similar names and character traits
<br /><br />This kind of thing falls into the "it's so ridiculous it's good" kind of category
Think of the Super Mario brother's movie, and Batman and Robin
If you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons, check this out
If you are of the younger generation (what this thing is actually intended for), and can look pass the greedy executives shamelessness, then run with it and enjoy
<br /><br />If you enjoy this cartoon I don't have a problem with you, it's the people who calculated this thing together that I am mad at
You know how they say piracy is like stealing a car; this show is like grave robbing
They might as well of dug up all the people involved with the original cartoon, shoved them on a display, dressed them up inerr pirate costumes, and charged money
If this show wasn't using characters (ones that didn't resemble the Looney Toons in anyway whatsoever) that have already made the studios millions, then this would be fine
But no! For shame Warner brothers, for shame
<br /><br />If I saw this thing as a 30 second gag on an episode of the Simpson's or Family Guy, I would love it
As it is I just can't believe this was ever made
I would bet anyone that 80% of the people who work on this show hate it
But whatever it doesn't really matter, in 10 years this show will have been forgotten, while the originals will live on foreveror at least until the world ends
<br /><br />"Coming 2008, Snoopy and the peanut gang are back, and now they have freaking lasers and can turn invisible! Can Charley Brown defeat the evil alien warlord Zapar? Tune in and see
What's to like about this movie???<br /><br />It is in colour! <br /><br />It has some impressive underwater photography! <br /><br />It has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times! <br /><br />So 3 out of 10! <br /><br />Sometimes the music is speeded up! Especially when the shark or the baddies are about to move in! <br /><br />Sometimes it is slowed! As if to convey to the audience it's about to be time for sympathy! <br /><br />As another one bites the dust! As if in a "spagetti Western" this has much similarity to! <br /><br />It's not that the Italians can't produce quality productions! There was a series of TV movies with a heading like "Octopus" numbered about 1 to 7, screened on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s about mafia-type conflicts! And they were excellent! But alas, you won't find it here!!!<br /><br />I assumed it was made about 1960s! Sadly it was 20 years out of date, as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end! <br /><br />Then there was the razor-sharp bite of the speedy shark that makes for a red dust repeatedly emerging in the bluish waters! <br /><br />Amidst it all, either in bar-room brawl or in observing the latest sea-side bloody demolition by the relentlessly hungry shark, the mate of the hero looks on through his glasses of little concern, as if he too was bored in his relentless role amidst a lack of much evidence of plot or anyone's character development! <br /><br />At least the hero indicates a fleeting concern belatedly, for his ex-wife! <br /><br />But of course, even if the music fails to awaken our realisation, we have the sinister sound in the baddies' voices, as if to nudge us that another dark deed is about to emerge! <br /><br />And near the end, someone thought of a twist! Just when we thought it was all totally predictable! But stay tuned, folks, for you may find another twist! If you are watching closely! To, more or less, warm your heart! <br /><br />Follow the advice of the hero, and have a few beers along the way! It'll make your viewing of "Night of the Sharks" more enjoyable! <br /><br />Then you'll be ready for something like a "007" movie to ease your way back into reality when this is over!!
I only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what I saw was a total piece of crap
The scenes I saw were as bad as an Ed Wood movie
Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that's not true; the idiot who directed this junk is the WORST director ever
<br /><br />The American cop has a German accent! The "police station" was a desk in a warehouse with a sign "Police Station" hanging on the wall
There is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about TEN FEET
<br /><br />This cop pulls women over, cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse
He tells his cop partner to wait in the car
Then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag
The cop partner thinks maybe something is not right, that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women, but he isn't sure if that is what's happening because - he's a moron! The dialog is totally stupid, the acting is awful, and the characters act in the stupidest manner I have ever seen on screen
It is totally obvious to the cop's partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it, and yet, the partner, who is there all along, doesn't know what is happening! <br /><br />The director of this film is a total hack
I stopped the movie at 30 minutes because I couldn't take it anymore
It has to be one of the WORST movies I have ever started to watch and I won't waste anymore time on it writing this review
*****WARNING, MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS WHICH WILL BE MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THIS TRIPE
**** <br /><br />Heres some good advise to anyone living in the U
Whenever Channel 5 has an old 80's comedy on late at night, read a book instead
I am currently in the process of recovering from a seizure, due to reading some of the comments on this film on here
I am actually shocked at the fact that someone actually said this film was realistic! All I can say is thank god the Cold War never escalated or else we might as well have given the Commie's our borders
I found this film dire in the utmost pretence, maybe it is just my British perception of what makes a film funny, who knows? But in all aspects, this film is not just awful, its teeth grindingly terrible
<br /><br />I've never been a fan of Bill Murray, and its rubbish like this that justify my feelings towards him
Don't get me wrong, I loved Ghostbuster's, which was made only three years after this film
I can safely say that I haven't wasted my time so blatantly like this since seeing the first running of Operation Delta Force over here, though these two films have more in common than you would think
For 1 thing, they both have terrible action sequences from beginning to end, and 2nd
They are both riddled with cheesy Cliché's, throughout
<br /><br />Heres one thing, these guys are supposed to be in the "U
Yet they are allowed to wallow around their Camp, Willy nilly, seducing female Military Police Officers, and subsequently shagging them silly in the Generals Quarters
Talk about Random! This film is just terrible for this I'm afraid
Now don't get me wrong, I'm no feminist sympathiser, but the fact that these two women actually fall hands over heels in love with the two characters shortly after arresting them, letting them go free
Twice, is just insulting to the female race
The fact that one tatty haired, fat lipped bum (Winger) and his hapless sidekick Ramis can simply sweet talk themselves into into the MP's underwear, to which they fall madly in love with the two of them is nothing short of ludicrous
<br /><br />Then there is the training scenes, where you get to meet the Squad "Phycho" who unconvincingly threatens to kill anyone who touches him or his stuff, followed by the overweight bloke (played by the late and great John Candy) who claims he joined the army to "avoid paying $400 for anger management classes"
Leading to loud mouthed Murray paying tribute to the "Giant Toe," (WTF?) 'Drill Seargent' who honestly couldn't organise a pi$$ up in a brewery, let alone his band of recruits
All this scene serves to do is to prelude loads of fight scenes, with people saying "way to go ass hole'!" all the time, etc etc
<br /><br />The scenes then carry on showing the rag tag bunch making utter tits of themselves on the Assault Course, leading to a scene where one of them shoots wildly into the air at some passing birds with an assault rifle, peppering a watch tower with bullets
He miraculously escapes undisciplined as well
) Eventually Leading up the the passing out parade, where the hapless squad make a magic turn around within the space of two hours
(Bugger me, Miracle!) Thanks to some wise words from Murray, to which they then direct a massively none military like dance routine in front of a Geriatric 'General' in front of the rest of the squads
All of this to the immense pleasure of their two Girlfriends on the stand, who really should've been arresting them
This bit is nothing short of amazing though
He then chooses them to guard a new Multi-Million Dollar Prototype Armoured Vehicle in Italy (which turns out to be just a mobile home painted green with loads of gadgets on the inside), claiming "This is exactly what this Army needs!" righto
<br /><br />Then there is the dire finale, where Murray and Ramis decide to steal this top-secret prototype Military Vehicle to pick up their newly acquired and somewhat Hyperactive MP Girlfriends in Germany
To which the Hapless Captain (John Larroquette) then finds out and leads the Squad of fresh recruits on a retrieval Mission for this vehicle
To which they then take a "wrong turn" en-route and end up in Soviet Held Czechoslovakia, where they are captured
) Thus begins a rescue attempt by Ramis and Murray + Birds in hand, to which is where a big fight, loads of shooting from the hip and blowing tanks up
With them coming back as National Heroes, humiliating the Russians by calling them "pussies," etc etc
They only just stole a prototype Military vehicle, drove it into a Warsaw Pact country and almost caused an International incident which could've sparked WW3!<br /><br />This film is honestly more fun that being diagnosed with a terminal illness
I know its meant to be a Comedy, it got all the right actors for it, but where in the hell is it? Have Channel 5 cuts those bits out? The only redeeming feature in this film is the repetitive use of naked women taking showers, and female Mud Wrestling
(like I said, Random) Not that it helps to divert from the fact that this is an utterly crap film, of course
This film should realistically be aimed at immature 9 year old's, sadly, we have to watch it instead
My advice, do something a little more useful with your time
The social commentary was way overblown and the mystery itself is built and solved through a series of implausible coincidences that were entirely unbelievable
Nothing has changed in Fitz's personal life in the past decade that makes it remotely interesting
<br /><br />I even had trouble understanding why he was complaining about his stay in Australia as compared to the opportunities to solve mysteries that he has in England
Can he not insinuate himself on the Australian police? It seems like a very artificial plot point to get him involved in a crime investigation
<br /><br />The latter episodes of the original series were pretty melodramatic and implausible, sometimes bordering on silliness, and this one picks up that mantle rather than returning to the focus of series one
Tarzan the Ape Man is a remake of the 1932 film of the same time, and like that earlier film, it has little resemblance to Burroughs' literary character
But while the 1932 Tarzan was reduced to "Tarzan - Jane" speech, this Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keeffe, doesn't speak or even grunt
He does do the the Tarzan yell a couple of times, which sounds like it was sampled from the earlier film
<br /><br />No, Tarzan plays second banana to Bo Derek as Jane
Or rather, as third banana to Bo Derek's left breast and her right breast
This movie has no point but to show Derek naked
<br /><br />The two action scenes in the film are presented in slow motion, and are really bad
<br /><br />Bizarrely enough, Tarzan has an orangutan side kick in this film
Maybe he car pooled in from Sumatra with the Indian elephants that are also on display
I'm not sure how related they are, but I'm almost certain that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie (or the story that it's based on)
Very similar plotline, and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very, very similar
Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie, so see that one instead
<br /><br />This one moves very slowly, but being a late 60s French movie, that is to be expected of the style
Told in a retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls revisiting the school
The editing of the flashbacks with the current scenes is a little bit confusing at first, particularly since the audio from each overlaps (ie, hearing flashbacks while seeing the present and vice versa)
Also, the "girls" are a bit old to think that they are in a boarding school
Finally, not much character development to even get you attached to the movie
But then I loved Babe, a Pig in the City and have been spoiled by talking animal films that are exceptionally well done in every way
They were all irritating especially Chris Rock's guinea pig, but then what could I expect, it's Chris Rock
I believe I smiled once or twice at a couple cute lines, but that's it
I was fortunate enough to meet George Pal (and still have my DS:TMOB poster autographed by him) at a convention shortly after the release, and asked him why he chose to do the film "camp"
Before he could answer, two studio flacks intercepted and lectured me on how the studio "knew best" and how "no one will take such a film seriously"
I had been reading the Bantam reprints for a couple of years thanks to a friend (ComiCon attendees of the 1970s will recall Blackhawk and his band? I was in a couple of years of that with him), and had higher hopes than what we got
<br /><br />The flacks insisted that no high adventure would ever be done seriously, and so doing 'camp' was the only way
Several other fans jumped in on my side, with Pal listening as best he could
At the end of the little event, Pal came up to us and apologized, wishing he could have done more and better
<br /><br />STAR WARS put the lie to the flacks, and a year after Pal's death, Spielberg and Lucas proved that Doc Savage could have easily been the next major movie franchise
<br /><br />Tear out the memory or history of Doc, and the film would have been worth a 6/10 rating as nothing more than a mindless popcorn seller
<br /><br />But destroying the legacy like that was no less an abomination than killing a baby in the crib
<br /><br />Doc Savage can still come to the screen, and survive the inevitable comparisons by the ill-informed to Indiana Jones, but it would have to be done in all seriousness and earnest to reclaim the glory that we should expect from the First American Superhero
<br /><br />SIDENOTES: Yes, there was a second script for ARCHENEMY OF EVIL, and it's a lot more serious
Yes, there was simultaneous footage shot, but mostly establishing shots and very little with actors
And, yes, there _is_ a one-sheet of Ron Ely leaping over a brick wall and blasting at something over his shoulder with a specially built bronze pistol
Ely's wearing a duster over a button down white shirt with a bronze tie, and the words "DOC SAVAGE: ARCHENEMY OF EVIL
Coming Next Summer!" POSTSCRIPT: If anyone knows who the studio flacks were that accompanied George Pal in 1975 to San Diego for the convention, smack the idiots up the side of the head and call them the idiots that they are
At the time, they were doing dorkknobs and Fu Manchu in stripes and baggy canvas pants, and carrying Paramount portfolios
It is the unity of two heroes from two great seventies sci-fi films
The great one is truly great, in fact it's the best
The bad one is truly bad, in fact it's the worst
Of course of the great I refer to "Star Wars" and it's star Mark Hamill, aka "Luke Skywalker", who is the hero of this film about a kid who gets his Vette swiped and then goes to Vegas (on a lead) and after a whole lot of adventures, eventually recovers it
(Since he's into fixing cars I guess you can call him "Lube Skywalker")
Along the way he meets a hooker with a heart of gold, and ends up facing off with a character played by Kim Milford, the hero from the seventies sci-fi cult film "Laserblast", which is, as I've hinted at earlier, the worst sci-fi film ever made
Milford plays the lead baddie whom Hamill must steal his car back from
I realize that no one cares about this meeting of two great sci-fi heroes, but I do
And I also must say that this is one of the best/worst movies of all time
Mark Hamill's acting needs the force, the plot needs extensive Jedi training, and the character of the hooker played by Annie Potts just might be the most annoying character of all time, ever, in any film I've ever seen
But it's a fun movie to watch on a weekend day, or a weekday night, late at night, very late
It's one of those films that meanders, looking for something but without quite finding it and yet, at the same time, it's entire purpose is, like free-form jazz, to simply exist as is
And what is, isn't that great, but you can't say it isn't entertaining, because for an hour and a half you might feel ripped off, but you won't feel cheated
So turn off your mind, relax, and enjoy this muddled gem without any expectations, and may the force be with you, always
A not bad but also not so great heist film
Kirk Douglas is a recently released from prison safe-cracker who, after turning down an offer from the Mob, decides to pull the job himself
He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma
Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves pursued by mafia goon Romano Puppo as well as entangled in a really goofy love triangle with Douglas's infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan)
Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly and there's at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving Puppo & Gemma
Though an Italian production, most of the filming appears to have been done in Germany
Douglas is fine, not just slumming it in an Giallo quickie
The striking Bolkan gives a terrific performance
The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone)
I just saw this film on DVD last night, and decided to check out the reviews this morning
It seems that "I, Robot" has polarized the critical viewing community here on IMDb (and given rise to a lot of insults and name-calling, too)
<br /><br />I find this somewhat surprising, as this film is not great (or even good), but neither is it terrible (or even really bad)
Depressing that the US film-goer population is so ready to lap up insipid, clichéd re-heats, and acclaim them as spectacular new works
This film as "retread" written all over it, from the plot line (an uneasy mix of Asimov and modern-day uber-action) to Smith's character (a smart-mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium), to the special effects (that borrowed from Matrix and a few others)
<br /><br />"I, Robot" is, sadly, quite possibly the perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial plot, insipidly snappy dialog, and lots and lots of adrenaline
Smith is mediocre, but we already knew that (he seems to be Hollywood's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis)
The story has lots of holes in it, of all sizes, but I don't think most people drawn to this film are critically-minded enough to notice
Perhaps a blockbuster by today's standards, but very B-movie compared to true winners
Practically any movie that he's been in is the better off for it
Now ol' George had absolutely NOTHING to do with this movie
, but he once said something that describes said movie to a T
<br /><br />I don't recall his exact words, but he basically said that Great Writing can Save Bad Acting, But Great Acting CanNOT save Bad Writing
Never has this little observation been truer than in "The All New Adventures of Laurel & Hardy: For Love or Mummy"
<br /><br />The casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect
Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) not only look the parts, but they do an exceptionally good job at mimicking the real deal (mannerisms and all)
This movie should stand as a lasting testament to their talents
That said, this movie falls flat on its face when it comes to (you guessed it) WRITING
<br /><br />Aside from the opening dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (which was very "in character") and a brief gag involving a taxi, this movie is an absolute chore to sit through
<br /><br />PROBLEM # 1: Too much time and effort went into the plot
<br /><br />I don't want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty British lady
What I WANT is to see Stan and Ollie (or at least, their stand-ins)
Way too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or to the not-very-funny secondary characters that said plot revolved around
<br /><br />However, even if this movie had been all jokes, that would still leave us with
PROBLEM # 2: Most of the jokes are what I would call "watered-down" slapstick
<br /><br />What do I mean by "watered down"?<br /><br />In slapstick, a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comedic effect (ala Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges
<br /><br />In "watered-down" slapstick (as I define it), a character gets mildly hurt or inconvenienced, and the filmmakers play that up for comedic effect
<br /><br />Maybe an illustration would help:<br /><br />In Looney Tunes, Daffy Duck gets shot by Elmer Fudd
His bill falls off and he puts it back on
<br /><br />In this "gem", Ollie accidentally bumps into some people
They turn around, tell him to be careful, and continue on their merry way
and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes
It's as though they're this movie's bread and butter
The writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like they're supposed to be funny
Granted, the example I just gave is the most extreme case, but I can only cut it so much slack
<br /><br />Long story short: The film just doesn't work because the script fails to capitalize on Pinchot's and Sartain's abilities to impersonate Stan and Ollie
Instead, the script capitalizes on plot exposition and lame jokes
Watching this movie is basically watching two excellent impersonators who were given no real material to work with
<br /><br />Not a good movie, but an incredible sleeping aid
<br /><br />I say give this one a miss and stick with the real deal (just so long as you steer clear of "Atoll K" and "Be Big")
I rented "New Best Friend" hoping for a movie similar to enjoyable teen thrillers such as "Gossip" and "The Curve"
Instead, "New Best Friend" is much more like "The In Crowd", in which there are no thrills and the acting is incredibly phony
"New Best Friend" is boring, and the events during the movie are the same
Don't you just hate it when you order steak but the restaurant gives you chicken?<br /><br />Such is how I felt watching this so-called "Battlestar Galactica"
Arguments can be made over its quality but the fact remains, it's NOT what the fans ordered
<br /><br />Imagine if you were sitting down at that proverbial restaurant I mentioned
You have waited years for them to bring back their famous New York Strip steak which you loved
When your meal arrives, you find they've applied the name "New York Strip" to a chicken dish
You complain but the waiter merely states "but ze cheeken, ees really GOOD zir"! Do you really care if the chicken is good? You wanted New York Strip - a STEAK! The waiter then explains, "you zee zir, ze chef wanted to to do, as you zay, zomezing NEW
We felt ze cheeken would be more popular zo we gave it the name of our previous delicious deesh"
You ask if you will ever find the original New York Strip on the menu in the future but are informed that because the restaurant HAS a dish called "New York Strip" now on the menu, you'll never see the original New York Strip - ever again
<br /><br />Such is the case with creating something NEW and slapping the "Battlestar Galactica" namesake on it
<br /><br />* This mini series is an affront to all fans of the original show! *<br /><br />It's a shame the production team put in charge of this new version obviously held contempt for the original
The team put in charge of resurrecting BG should have LOVED the original series - seeking to improve what the fans loved, not try to shamelessly sell this new series by exploiting the Battlestar Galactica name
<br /><br />If SciFi Channel wanted to give us a NEW show, then DO so! Give it a new name! Don't use the name we fondly remember in an attempt to lure in viewers
That effectively robs us of the chance to see any semblance of the original in the future
<br /><br />We have been waiting for 25 years to see what we knew as BG because we LIKED something about the original! We didn't simply want the NAME and remnants of the basic concept
There are things we LOVED about the original series!<br /><br />Sadly, probably the BEST elements of the original were those which were omitted
Sure, the original BG was imperfect and could have used some updating
This mini series, however, was not an improvement in any regards but the special effects (which were good but not anything unusual by today's standards)
<br /><br />Many viewers will debate back and forth about the quality of this NEW show but we will not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore for destroying our dream
I shall offer some comments about the merits of this new mini by itself (not in comparison to the original):<br /><br />The battle sequences were the best part
Effort was obviously put into making the effects more "real" in appearance and less "wow - look at that effect"
I would not say these sequences were exceptional by today's standards yet they were in keeping with made-for-cable original movies
What was the deal with this "pseudo-live-cam"? Some views tried to fake the effect of a "real" camera with lagging tracking and jerky zooms
However, it was over-used considering there was no apparent SOURCE of these cameras
The infinitely more intelligent series, Babylon 5, is the only instance I've seen such "live cams" used effectively, when we were supposedly witnessing action from Security Cams
<br /><br />The script, you ask? The script felt like it was written by a teenager, FOR other teenagers
The characters felt cardboard and stereotypical
Indeed, the whole story felt pieced together from other well-known stereotypes
The only good features of the entire story were those few elements which were preserved from the original series
It was obviously "dumbed down" for digestion of your average TV audience
<br /><br />The human interaction was pitiful
Rather than drama based on subtle looks, expressions and fine timing, every moment of human tension was exaggerated to the point of being so obvious they lost all ability to move any refined viewer
Such was obvious in any interaction between Adama and son
The director must have been trying to make sure the most dense and unfeeling viewer wouldn't miss it even if not paying attention
Sorry, but real humans don't behave like the continually
<br /><br />I wouldn't have considered this a BAD show had it stood on its own
Nothing great; it will never be revered by true SciFi fans or artisans, but it would be watchable by the masses
I personally could have lived without it, though
I only watched it to see how it really DID capture the spirit of the original
<br /><br />How this mini series will always be remembered is as a symbol of how quality in storytelling has been cast aside to appeal to greater numbers
How even SciFi Channel has "dumbed down" its productions to cater to the masses as opposed to its true niche market, the Science Fiction fans
It will be the time we asked for steak and they insisted on giving us chicken, despite our complaints
<br /><br />I leave you with only one thought - <br /><br />NO "MOORE"
Oh yes, Sakura Killers is a goofy, horrible ninja movie, make no mistake
But it's also an incredibly enjoyable one
This is largely thanks to the awesome presence of one Chuck Connors, who is billed as starring in the movie but really only shines in a few scenes
I suppose he's supposed to be sort of an Obi Wan Kenobi type ("The tough ninja-buster", the box copy exclaims) but his 'wisdom' is laughable
"Move without thinking"??? My friend says this is the sign of mental retardation, not of supreme concentration
<br /><br />But really, his two aides, Sonny and Dennis, have such horrible dialogue that 'Brooklyn', as we call The Colonel, tends to shine in comparison
Especially watch for Dennis' logic regarding the 'genetic splicing' the Sakura are involved with
If you know anything about cloning you will die laughing
And yes, this is a major plot point, folks
<br /><br />A terribly fun movie, Sakura Killers is a hard-to-find gem
I won't spoil the 'trick' ending for you either, except that it's a perfect set up for a Sakura Killers 2
:-( Because he does have a the smoothest ways of blowing away ninjas
For those fans of Laurel and Hardy, the 1940s and beyond were a very sad time for the team
Their contracts with Hal Roach Studios had expired and now they were "free agents"--able to work for any studio who offered them a job
Unfortunately, Fox, RKO, MGM (without Roach) and even a French film company who hired the boys had absolutely no touch for their comedic talents
Plus, Stan and Ollie were a lot older and seeing these geriatric men taking pratfalls seemed sad, not particularly funny
Stan looked very ragged and Ollie's weight had ballooned up to the point where he could barely walk--and so it made me feel uncomfortable laughing at their very, very sedate antics
<br /><br />In addition to their age, this particular film suffers because Fox Studios oddly cast them in a supporting role and created a parallel plot involving a young couple--something that reduced their time on screen AND turned them into insipid "hangers on" instead of just being themselves
A cute and cuddly Stan and Ollie is very foreign to the old Laurel and Hardy of the 20s and 30s--and just seemed awfully strange and suited them poorly
<br /><br />Now even with their age, this COULD have been a decent movie if it had been given decent writing and if it appeared the studio cared--and it's quite obvious they were using the "B unit" here--with, at best, second class support
In particular, there are very few laughs and the last 10 minutes of the film is simply dreadful--relying exclusively on a sloppy rear-projected screen for the stupid chase scene--which might just rank as one of the worst of its kind in film history
<br /><br />For mind-numbed zombie lovers of Laurel and Hardy, it's probably a film they will love
But, for lovers of the team who are willing to honestly evaluate this film relative to their amazing earlier films, it simply comes up wanting indeed
In fact, of all their full-length films pre-1940, I can't think of one I liked less than DANCING MASTERS
Unfortunately, of the post-1940 films, this might just be one of their better ones
Sadly, it got a lot worse--with wretched films like THE BIG NOISE and NOTHING BUT TROUBLE
I just wish the boys had just retired after SAPS AT SEA
<br /><br />Finally, I wonder if all the generally positive reviews for this film on IMDb might reflect the reviewers' love of the team more than it's an indication that this is a good film? For an audience who are NOT already in love with the team, I don't know HOW this film will do anything but bore the audience--it certainly WON'T convince anyone that Laurel and Hardy were comedic geniuses
But even comedic geniuses need material worthy of their talents
Not even Bob Hope, escorted by a raft of fine character actors, can save this poorly written attempt at wartime comedy, as his patented timing has little which which to work
The plot involves a Hollywood film star named Don Bolton (Hope), and his attempt to evade military service at the beginning of World War II, followed by his enlistment by mistake in a confused attempt to court a colonel's daughter (Dorothy Lamour)
Bolton's agent, played by Lynne Overman, and his assistant, portrayed by Eddie Bracken, enlist with him and the three are involved in various escapades regarding training exercises, filmed in the Malibu, California, hills
Paramount budgeted handsomely for this effort, employing some of its top specialists, but direction by the usually reliable David Butler was flaccid, and this must be attributed to a missing comedic element in the scenario
A shift toward the end of the film to create an opportunity for heroism by Bolton is still-born with poor stunt work and camera action in evidence
Oddly, Lynne Overman is given the best lines and this veteran master of the sneer does very well by them
Dorothy Lamour looks lovely and acts nicely, as well, and it is ever a delight to see and hear Clarence Kolb, as her father, whose voice is unique on screen or radio, but there is little they can do to save this film, cursed as it is with an error in script assignment
All the standard romantic-comedy scenes, even down to the taxi sprinting to the airport to stop the woman flying away
The only thing that saves this is the acting of Alison Eastwood & some of the minor characters (blink and you'll miss Gabrielle Anwar), who obviously had some fun
<br /><br />Turn it off when the pair are in bliss, and you won't have to go through the inevitable plot pain
There are two reasons why I did not give a 1 to this movie
One reason are some of the actors (like Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) work, who tried to play at their usually good level of acting
However at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting
<br /><br />The other reason is the cool idea and looking of the Cyborg, which is quite different to most other such roles I've seen so far
<br /><br />Everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be
Boring scenes, useless and boring dialogs, bad script work
And it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors
It could have been an interesting story though, but they failed completely
Anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series
The Borg does not come around until Q brings the Enterprise to the Gamma sector, the Klingons are NEVER seen until Kirk encounters them, the NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship to carry the Enterprise name
need I go on? Berman and Pilliar have made a mockery of Gene Roddenberry's creation
After he died, they only saw $$$$ and just went their own way
No wonder Majel Barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series
I don't blame her for not being involved with this mess
He's a great actor, as are the entire cast
I like them all, but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series
I think more people watched Deep Space 9 (which was untimely canceled)
The Crater Lake Monster is easily one of the most awful, amateurish film I've ever seen - ranking right up there with Manos, the Hands of Fate in terms of poor acting, useless direction, and kindergarten-level production values
In this movie a silly-looking claymation/stop-motion animated dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in Bumblebum, CA, and begins dining on the local hayseeds
In the thrilling climax, the creature, described by one local as "a giant alligator with flippers", drags it's ponderous bulk over the ground to chase its would-be lunch, before a bulldozer bumps it a couple of times & it dies from boredom
Every character in this moovie is a complete moron
One pointless subplot shows a hick go into a liquor store to purchase a $4
75 pint of Ripple; instead of simply buying the bottle, the idiot shoots the cashier and another bystander, shoots at a cop, gets chased towards the lake, all so that he can eaten by the monster
Unfortunate close-ups of the monster reveal it to be nothing more than a piece of styrofoam
There's a fake magician struggling with a phony British accent (to make him seem more legit), two overly-bumbling redneck boat renters, some cheesy "pre-historic cave art" done in crayon, and annoying banjo-pickin' background moosic
In one painful scene, the fake magician and his dopey wife/girlfriend/accomplice manage to pad the movie an extra 4 minutes by cowmenting on how may stars they can see in the night sky, even though it is clearly day time still
Even on constant fast-forward, this moovie hurts, and hurts bad
MooCow says call the fumigators, 'cause this cow pie really stinks! :=8
Although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to 4
I have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose
This is also a "horror" film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight
My friend and I laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scared
<br /><br />The only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries
<br /><br />The supermodel Nicole Petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie, half of the time she is British and half the time she is American
The film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional Japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads 'KUSHIATA KYOTO, JAPAN 1840'
A young Japanese trainee Samurai named Masanori (Toshiya Maruyama) walks up the winding path to the house, inside waits Otami (Mako Hattori) with whom he is having an affair behind her husband, Shugoro's (Tsuiyuki Sasaki as Toshiyuki Sasaki) back who happens to be Masanori's teacher
Shugoro unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other
His honour destroyed the enraged Samurai brutally murders both Otami and Masanori before committing suicide
Over a century later and Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) arrives in Japan on a working holiday with his wife Laura (Susan George) and their young daughter Amy (Amy Barrett)
Their close friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure) who works for the American consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay, you don't need me to you where! He jokingly says it's going so cheap because it's haunted, to which both Ted and Laura laugh off as they obviously don't believe in ghosts, at least for the time being that is
Almost immediately the film goes into cliché mode
Lights turn on and off by themselves, Laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local Zen Monk (Henry Mitowa) gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it's too late which they ignore, of course
The spirits of Otami, Masanori and Shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a Majyo witches (Tsuyako Olajima) curse put upon them
But there may be a way they can break the curse, unfortunately for the Fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage, daughter and possibly even their very lives
<br /><br />Directed by Kevin Connor I thought this was a pretty average film, OK to watch once if you've got nothing better to do but after a day or two you'll probably have completely forgotten it
Nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there's nothing particularly good about the film either
The script by Robert Suhosky from the novel by James Hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly by-the-numbers, a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction doesn't help things
There are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic crabs that try to get Amy and her babysitter, Noriko (Mayumi Umeda)
And there is a scene where the Zen Monk exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished outside unable to get back in, however that is until Ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in, some exorcism! One more thing, I think it was a bad idea to have Doug McClure who was 47 when he made this, try his hand at Kung-Fu and oriental sword fighting! George gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very unerotic sex scene with McClure, although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensure no below the waist nudity was present
Apart from a couple of mostly off screen decapitations there's no blood, gore or violence to speak about
The 'transparent' ghost effects are OK but they ain't going to impress many people these days
It's professionally enough made and looks quite nice but the potential in the Japanese setting and myths is squandered as this film could have been set in America, England or any Western country without having to change a thing
Somewhere in his non-fiction book DANSE MACABRE, Stephen King suggests that one secret of writing scary stories is to avoid showing your readers exactly what horrible thing is waiting behind the door to get them
If at last the door bursts open and a bug ten feet tall lurches through, the reader may be a little scared, but he'll also think, "Well, I can deal with that
" There's nothing more frightening than what lurks, unseen and unknown, just on the other side of that tightly closed door, waiting to get you
<br /><br />THE HAUNTING is so completely misconceived that director Jan De Bont more or less starts off his movie by metaphorically throwing open that door himself and yelling: "Look, everybody, look! It's a ten-foot-tall bug! Isn't that SCARY?!" The law of diminishing returns immediately kicks in
By the end of the movie, the director is, so to speak, jumping up and down, banging his CGI pots and pans madly, and hoarsely screaming: "Look, everyone, look! Here come ten HUNDRED-foot-tall bugs!
And now, here come a hundred THOUSAND-foot-tall bugs!" <br /><br />The filmmakers apparently believed that special effects alone could compensate for all the other shortcomings in this endeavor (and there are many)
In fact, impressive as they are, the special effects are so insistent and obtrusive that the distracted viewer winds up staring at them -- whether in admiration or annoyance -- instead of being immersed in a story
<br /><br />For me, the nadir of this film's sheer stupidity comes when a statue, with "blood" gushing from its mouth, tries to drown Liam Neeson (as Dr
The filmmakers clearly didn't know what to do with this alleged idea once they had it, so they just have Neeson thrash around in the water a bit, flailing his arms and going glug-glug
By the next scene, the good doctor has apparently dried himself off and, ho hum, forgotten all about the annoying incident
<br /><br />Shirley Jackson's novel seems to have been dumbed-down into this ridiculous screenplay by a committee of low-IQ teenage stoners who thought the way to frighten people was to make every effect bigger and louder: "Okay, next, let's, uh, make the ceiling, you know, look like a creepy face, and, uh, come down on her
and all these spiky things, like, trap her in the bed
"<br /><br />The sole saving grace of THE HAUNTING is that it at last becomes so awful that it's actually funny
By the time Owen Wilson (as Luke Sanderson) fell on the floor and then went on his Magic-Carpet Ride O' Death, I just about fell on the floor myself, laughing
<br /><br />Badly constructed, witless, grotesquely heavy-handed, utterly unbelievable, and filled with clunky dialogue and pointless scenes, this vacuous HAUNTING is a textbook example of how NOT to make a horror movie
I've always been a great fan of Woody Allen and always will be for most of what he did in the past, but only a blind lover could ignore how dull, meaningless, pretentious and most of all horrendously acted this movie is
A vacuous mental masturbation based on inconsistent grounds
And what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate a presumed "actor Allen-clone", that is putting into Will Farrell's mouth and gestures what Allen would have done in Farrell's place had he been 30 years younger
what was intended to be philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual pondering, unaware of its comic effect
I love killer Insects movies they are great fun to watch, I had to watch this movie as it was one of my Favourite horror books by Shaun Hutson
<br /><br />I have met him and I wish I did listen to him as this movie was terrible like he Said it was,after he said that I was still dying to see how bad it was
<br /><br />The plot: People are dying mysteriously and gruesomely, and nobody has a clue what the cause is
<br /><br />Only health worker Mike Brady has a possible solution, but his theory of killer slugs is laughed at by the authorities
<br /><br />Only when the body count begins to rise and a slug expert from England begins snooping around does it begin to look like Mike had the right idea after all
<br /><br />This movie as the most overacting you ever see a movie! Slugs in this movie are fast (Then normal) and it looks like they fast forwarding the scenes! <br /><br />This movie is nothing like the book at all, the book was ten times scarier, ten times gory and had a lot more story to it!<br /><br />I didn't like this movie at all! As I am huge fan of Slugs the book and second book called Breeding ground! Both of books are Great <br /><br />Read the book then watch the movie, you may like more then I did Give this 2 out 1
I got this movie out of Blockbuster in one of those racks were you can get like 5 movies for 20 bucks
I'd have to say I got my money's worth on this one
I had expected horrible dialogue, crappy monsters, and shaky cameras
Well, as Meatloaf said, two outta three ain't bad
<br /><br />The acting is bad, though not as bad as some movies I've seen
Or maybe I've watched so many low budget movies recently I've lost perspective
There are some bits were the acting is downright terrible, but for the most part it's of at least High School Play level
<br /><br />The CG for the Sasquatch in this movie is probably the second-worst part
The first thing I thought when I saw it (and I noticed another reviewer agreed with me) was that a man in an ape suit would have been better
Clunky stop-motion animation would have looked better
<br /><br />So you may be asking why I call the CG the second-worst part
That's because the very worst part of the movie is the sound effects
I've been camping, I know what insects sound like in the woods at night, and while they can be loud, they're not deafening like the cacophony in this movie
Usually when the "background" sounds drown out the movie's dialogue, it's a bad thing, but from what I caught of the dialogue of this film, I wasn't missing much
<br /><br />The action was infrequent and boring
The tension was non-existent, as was any sense of empathy with the characters
Speaking of the characters, they were all cookie-cutter and bland
The only mildly engaging byplay was between
There was a line or two that made me crack a wan smile, but that was about it
<br /><br />The cinematography was decent, a step or two above what you'd normally see in a movie like this
However, it still had that "home movie" quality to it that you get with movies made on pocket change and a prayer
<br /><br />If you're like me and get a kick out of shoestring budget genre flicks, and you see this one in the dollar bin, think about grabbing it
I picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie
But I had no Idea what I was getting myself into
<br /><br />I started the movie and soon I had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture
<br /><br />I finally know what hell is like
There was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens
<br /><br />Instead of watching this movie I suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can
You will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie
Oh just what I needed,another movie about 19th century England
Which is pretty much like regular England,only nobody's vandalising football stadiums
In this picturesque setting of lords,dames and other randomly chosen titles,Charlotte Gainsbourg walks around aimlessly as Jane Eyre,from that novel nobody has ever read willingly
Rochester's crib,where she tries to teach a French girl to look at an empty chalkboard all the time
Rochester(William Hurt on auto-pilot)comes back to fall in love with Jane and all that,but there's still the matter of his fruitcake wife that is locked in the attic
After some people being thrown around and some carefully spread fire(they probably rented the set),the movie finally comes to an end
Everything looked really authentic,that's something I guess
With the releasing of "Farligt förflutet" Swedish film industry has truly hit rock bottom
Stefan (Jens Hultén) has for the past years lived a calm life with his wife Marie (Regina Lund)
One day an old friend of Stefan´s arrives with a favor to ask him
He is supposed to bring a suitcase filled with heroine through the Sweden-Germany customs
Unfortunately things in Germany don´t work out as planned and Stefan is now in big trouble
It is always nice to see a Swedish film that breaks the traditional family-drama pattern
Unfortunately if the people involved in the production have no clue of how a movie is supposed to be written, filmed or cut the result can only be catastrophic
The content can be concluded with: bad acting, an incoherent plot and idiotic dialogs
The only highlight in the movie is the unprovoked sex-scene wit the incredibly beautiful Regina Lund
This lasts for only a few seconds leaving approxamitly 90 minutes of pure, let´s say what it truly is, crap
Although the likeliness of someone focusing on THIS comment among the other 80+ for this movie is low, I feel that I have to say something about this one
I am not the kind of movie-watcher who pays attention to production value, thought-provoking dialog, or brilliant acting & directing
I mean it has almost everything i want out of a horror movie: blood, outrageousness, unintentional humor, etc
According to this evidence it should be my favorite
<br /><br />There are just too many things that compels you to yell at the screen
Like when the girl leaves the army guy when their car breaks down to find water (this spoils nothing so don't worry)
She walks into what I see as an abandoned hotel or something
Did she not see that there was a friggin' lake in the middle of the building??? Yes she's looking for water and passes up a lake
Why? Cuz she wants to know why the people (who aren't there cuz the place is abandoned) won't answer her when she calls out: "Is anybody there?" Oh this is just a little, insignificant piece of the big picture I'm painting
<br /><br />There is a reason, though, why I gave this film more than 1 star
It's one of those movies where if you forget how bad it really is, like I have a few times, you'll want to watch it again because it's just so over-the-top in every aspect
I called it blood in the first paragraph, but this movie has no blood, it has an ocean of gore
Also, it has pretty weird creatures in it as well: a zombie-baby (with an adult-size hand???) and a magically flying head to name just two
<br /><br />You know when you try to think of the worst and cheesiest movies ever made and you come up with '50's sci-fi movies? I believe that Zombi 3 and movies like it should top those
It has all the elements: scientists arguing with the government, warnings of the apocalypse on the radio, armies battling monsters, and so on
This IS the Plan 9 of the '80's! While I won't say that this is a waste of money if you want to buy it, just expect the very worst
And when you find out that expecting the worst is underestimating Zombi 3, it won't be all that bad
You might actually like it, I'm not saying that's impossible
<br /><br />Don't think I hate this movie, I don't
Killing Birds (aka Zombie 5) rules! (did I just blow my credibility?
What starts out as a gentle country yarn, inoffensive and mildly enjoyable romantic tale changes pace as Edward Norton's initially charming Harlan gradually reveals more about himself and things take a turn for the sinister, as the film gradually changes from a southern romance to a modern wild western
<br /><br />An amiable rancher (Norton) wanders into town and charms a young girl (Evan Rachel Wood), seemingly rescuing her from a dead-end existence with her bad-tempered father with a whirlwind romance, but it gradually becomes apparent that there is more to this cowboy than meets the eye
<br /><br />Edward Norton  a real chameleon actor (with changing facial hair to match) playing a country hick, accent slightly dodgy but maybe because he's merely trying to act the part without worrying about the accent
He certainly makes it appear effortless to make all the nuanced little adjustments as we learn more about Harlan
However, with too many small changes it means we are never sure exactly where Harlan is coming from, and what seemed like a good performance from Norton gradually becomes confused
Evan Rachel Wood is likable without ever really having a great deal to do other than bat her eyelids at Norton
<br /><br />Down in the Valley strikes as a slightly uneven tale due to its change of pace, and by never really making the protagonist's motives clear the audience's sympathies for the characters remain uncertain
Should we like this drifter or not? Even after a dramatic turn of events it remains unclear
This ambiguity is to the film's detriment, as if the writer could not make up their mind what kind of story they wanted to tell and settled for somewhat of a hotch-potch
Had the film remained one or the other it might have been a solid film, but as it is what we are left with is something of a mess
Fans of old-fashioned romance will enjoy a portion of the film but will be put off by the darkening tone
Completist fans of Norton aside (or fans of the lush scenery of the San Fernando valley), give this a miss
Imagine her at a friend's dinner party, and she adds a comment to the in-depth political discussion going on
People just look at her and say, "Oh what would YOU know, you were the star of 'Theodore Rex'"
How could anyone take her seriously after she lowered herself to be the star of this appalling piece of crap? Even little kids would be cringing in horror at this Thing
It reminded me of a particularly bad episode of 'Sigmund And The Sea Monsters'
Actually, come to think of it, 'Sigmund' was vastly superior to this
<br /><br />And however did it get made? By plying the producer with an illegal substance before telling him about it? Watch this hideous abomination at your own peril
It's so sad that Romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who relish this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows, as superficial and brutal as the "Garcea" series or the "Vacanta mare" child-plays
The difference is that Mugur Mihäescu, Doru Octavian Dumitru and other such sub-artisans never presume to claim their shows as "art"
Pintilie, who 40 years ago made a very good movie ("Duminicä la ora sase") followed by another one, nice enough ("Reconstituirea"), tries to declare his film-lenghts "art works" - but, unfortunately, he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression
As such, "Niki Ardelean" offers again a sample of "HOW NOT" - this being about its only merit
The acting is cringe worthy at best and the special effects are crude
Probarly the worst script in history some extremely embarrassing quotes i have ever heard in my life
I swear to god 'swept away' is better than this
Madonna should of won and Oscar compared to these guys
An hour and a half of my life i want back
Honestly people don't see this, even toddler would find this movie an insult to their intelligence
i found this movie very strange in the fact that it was hard to tell who is more wooden, theses guys here of the actual puppets
pleas guys don't waste your time on this movie you will live to regret it
Come on, what is the deal with this show, Power Rangers anyways? I always felt that the show, which was originally brought over from Japan in a better form, took what was great in Japan, and turned into one of the most ridiculous and pointless excuses in toy merchandising history! There is absolutely no point with this show whatsoever
<br /><br />The bad haircuts, bad costumes, earrings, etc, all show what was ridiculous back in the 1990s From the two idiots, Bulk and Skull, to the "duhs", of the main cast, Jason, Trini, Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: GIVE ME A BREAK!<br /><br />Saban brought this from Japan, and then Disney bought the rights to this show around five years ago
<br /><br />Now the public has to endure reruns of this show on the Disney channel and such
<br /><br />All I can say once again is give me a break
You've got this nut riding around in the blazing sun in a buggy with a parasol over it, killing people for his own reasons
You've got this same person sitting in a snow cave during a blizzard, cutting off pieces of his anatomy which have been frostbitten
Then you've got some woman in a house out in the middle of somewhere shooting wolves that are not there
What is the point of this film? Couldn't Bruce Dern find something better to do? This was a waste of film
I've never really considered myself much of "student" when it comes to watching films, I watch them, form an opinion and that's it
This film is without a doubt the most inept attempt at film making I've ever seen
Every kid who rocks up at university thinking they're gonna be the next Spielberg or Tarantino needs to be handed this film with a handbook titled "How Not to Make A Film"
Not only is there no story to be had, the film makers weren't even competent enough to make a film worth watching
It's been a while since I saw it, but all I can say is watch the overhead tracking shots in the opening scenes
They are never ending! It's almost like having your teeth pulled, only not as much fun
Although this film was made before Dogme emerged as the predominant method of filmmaking, and before digital triumphed over -- strike that
This 1991 masterpiece clearly anticipated those developments
Corin Nemec is just outstanding as the ne'er do well author and narrator
The pace is slow, but elegantly so, because the cinematography is so beautiful
, because I guarantee you'll never see a better nostalgia rip-off made-for- T
Creepshow 2 had a lot of potential, they just didn't put enough time in perfecting it
The stories were pretty cool and creepy enough, but it was lacking
It's a good movie, but after you've seen it once, you might want to see it again
This one hearkens back to the days of the matinée, when kids with nowhere else to hang out took their dates to the balcony after dumping their younger siblings below
It didn't matter what was on the screen - the little kids would sit through it and the big kids would ignore it
The adults, of course, would never see it
<br /><br />But they put it on video, anyway, along with most of the other creaky, low-budget "B" horror flicks of the golden age
This film's inherent and unintentional humor is derived from stale ideology (the "bad girls" harvested to replace poor Jan's crushed body - they had it comin'), overused plot (a mad scientist, trying to play God), violent yet conscientious monster (whose presence in the heretofore-normal-seeming scientist's rural lab is never fully explained), and acting that polarizes at wooden or over-the-top
<br /><br />This is a great party film, assuming your guests enjoy adding dialog and commentary to otherwise abominable cinematic exploits
In fact, should you or your guests prefer more passive entertainment, this film is also available on video in its "Mystery Science Theater 3000" treatment, in which the host and puppets of the cult TV series make the necessary additions for you
It seemed a lot like the movie Jaws when the Hopper was telling the Mayor to close parks was like when Roy Shider was telling the Mayor to close the beaches
They both said no way its summer! But the box says Hopper has to get into the mind of a killer and think like one
But he really doesn't do anything too interesting or exciting
I'm not even a little convinced he and his partner have any experience doing police work when they are in the office wondering how they are gonna solve this case
They just say lets do police work and we'll solve it
And whats up with all the old men with pool cues
I didn't even begin to believe that they were mob bosses
And then the guy who was doubting the guy the mob picked to handle finding the killer
With his hundred dollar haircut and that he thinks his Di@k is the size of a schoolbus
I thought he was gonna hit him with a baseball bat like in the other movies
I got this movie used and wouldn't buy it new
Oh and it was funny seeing the microphone above the scene where hopper is going out to get coffee
My nose is bent slightly out of shape as I write this
I had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared, so I assume it was rejected, even though it met all the usual guidelines
<br /><br />I found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes, particularly the performance of Jordi Mollà, a veteran actor who has appeared in such major productions as "Blow" and "The Alamo
Unfortunately, everything sinks eventually under the weight of a truly awful, melodramatic script
There is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative or lend even an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of art
<br /><br />An actual day trip to the beach at Valencia would be much less arduous than having to encounter these fictional characters again anywhere, anytime
This movie was exactly what I expected it to be when i first read the casting
I probably could have written a more exciting plot, it's a pity that they left it to a pack of Howler Monkeys
Alberto Tomba was surely a good skier but he has to thank God (and we too) that he does not have to rely on his actor skills to earn his living
He can't play, he can't talk, he can't even move very good on mainland without his skis
Michelle Hunziker is a pretty blonde girl, and that's all
She obviously wasn't chosen for her astounding competence in dramatic roles but most probably for her nice legs
Nevertheless I must admit that she could be the Tomba's acting teacher, because he's even a worse actor than her, and that's funny, especially considering that she isn't italian
I laughed all the time, watching this movie
I found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it actually made me laugh, loud, very loud
The pakage implies that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn are pulling off a huge bank robbery, but that's not what I got out of it! I didn't get anything! In the first half there's a new character (without introduction) in every other scene
The first half-hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is just one long, annoying, underlit chase scene
There's always an irritating sound in the background whether it's a loud watch ticking, a blaring siren, a train whistling, or even the horrible score by Quincy Jones
There are a lot of parts that are laughably bad, too
Like, the bad guys chasing Beatty on thin ice with a CAR! Or, the police arriving at the scene roughly fifteen times
The rumor is true: girls like COYOTE UGLY more than guys
And the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given
Jersey girl goes to New York to become a song writer
And after initial frustration of having no luck, overhears some girls partying about the $300 each they made last night
She gets an audition at the bar they work at and surprise! The place is completely full of "two year old toddlers" bursting at the sight of babes dancing
<br /><br />The story is not bad and some characters are likeable, especially Cammie (the "fashion coordinator" part was cute) and the bouncer but let's face it, the drama was horrible and completely laughable from the beginning
Violet and her father looked far too ridiculous while they were relating throughout the movie
And check out Violet too jamming on that keyboard with the break dancer!<br /><br />For the first time I could think of, how could the production be so terrible? For a brief moment with this movie, Hollywood could stand on its two feet and show a new low without any major public outcry without saying, "You were warned!" Instead, it seems COYOTE UGLY has a purposeful intent on trying to kiss every major rear in the world
Advertising babes in a bar, but showing a paper thin "pursue your dream" story disappointed every male teen you targeted!<br /><br />And finally, the music
There was absolutely no break of music I found in this movie, especially when it was needed (the hospital scene)
Every scene felt like some short music video you just wish would stop until the bar opened
But the climax was an ultimate laugher: an '80s like song you would expect Cyndi Lauper to jump on the stage and jam with Violet
Heck, I personally thought Bon Jovi was going to jump out with the long hair and jam too!<br /><br />Other than some really smart camera work with the coyote girls when dancing (especially the wet scene), and a couple cute cliches, COYOTE UGLY is something to be purely embarrassed about
Whether you watched or made it, it looked like nothing but time killing
Or wasting depending on how you look at it
Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel so I watch all the original movies that play on it
I really don't know if this movie can be called original
Starting a zoo/theme park on a remote island sounds pretty familiar
<br /><br />The movie starts out with a few stereotypical college kids on an island doing some kind of treasure hunt
One of them ends up dieing a rather gruesome death with some of the worst special effects I've seen
Also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many saber tooth tigers as possible for people to enjoy
3 of them have already escaped and are going around eating the tourists, or the people invited to the island to see the tigers first hand
Probably the coolest thing was the 1000lb saber tooth who crawled around on his front legs killing the mad scientist with a tooth statue of sorts that somehow shrinks and goes through the guys neck
<br /><br />The acting is extremely cheesy, the special effects are horrible
The CG tigers could almost pass for clay models, and even some of the sounds were off
For instance, when one of the college students is trying to escape, he uses an ax to break down a door, the ax goes into the door and about 2 seconds later you hear the sound
The cheesy deaths were quite funny though
There is a reason this went straight to video- the story is smarmy, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a sleazy way- sex in churches, and other scenes that border on tasteless(like the scene in the laundry room) taint this movie
Judge Reinhold as the cuckold is okay- but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done
But it is a good film for trivia contests- because so few people saw it
Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey
I have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled "The Treasure" but was changed to "Sharks' Treasure" in order to take advantage of the excitement created by "Jaws"
I think sharks were in one scene of this movie; the fact that they happened to be included in this "thriller" was supposed to sell tickets
Anytime something "good" happens in the movie, the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made
Gee, do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor? Could they have made it any more obvious? The only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing
There's plenty to appreciate here: spectacular locations and flying sequences; period costumes, props and sets; and competent writing and acting
However, to enjoy a drama, we need at least one principal who exhibits some qualities that we can like or admire
In this bunch of catty snobs, we found only one character who is at all likable  a hapless enlisted man in a fleeting peripheral role as their helpless victim
From the reviews here, it is clear that we are completely out of step, but we did not find their malicious-schoolgirl behavior amusing or entertaining
We threw in the towel after two of the six episodes, so you should discount these observations accordingly, but what I could find written about this mini-series gave us no cause to expect character transformation or redemption
good lord! (and that coming from an atheist), this "movie" is bad !<br /><br />much has already been said by the reviewers before (the ones who rated this piece 3 and below) to which I fully agree, I just like to add a few things: <br /><br />among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive end products, got chopped up by an Axe, raped by a broomstick, had their balls blown away - the ex-boyfriend suffers the worst torture while having to listen to the girl's endless and pointless babble at the kitchen table (as do we, but at least we have the mercy of the mute button)
<br /><br />had the director cut out the point- and endless graveyard and inverted scenes, our suffering would have been over after 30 minutes
<br /><br />the only things that made this flick at least somewhat bearable are Emily Haack's tits (one point)
my brain is so fried after watching this I feel the urgent need to watch (and suffer?) "Scrapbook" right now
!!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!!<br /><br />You`d think a story involving Archie Grey Owl - An Englishman posing as a red indian - would have a massive amount of humour involved
In fact I`d say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy
However Richard Attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making GREY OWL a serious drama
Worse , he`s made an extremely dire film too
Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between Grey Owl and Pony ( Played by the equally wooden Annie Gaupeau ) lacks any type of on screen chemistry
But to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray Archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing he`s a native American
The producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of Archie being an Englishman - That`s why I wrote " Possible spoiler " it`s not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is English , but it`s obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence there`s absolutely no surprise involved
<br /><br />Yes I do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isn`t actually a new concept
Theodore Roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told
And it should also be remembered that with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN ( And possibly THE TWO TOWERS if you want to class it as having a green message ) that there hasn`t actually been a great ecological film
In fact most environmentally concious films suck and that includes GREY OWL , a film that unsurprisingly had a serious problem in finding a distributo
I sought out a copy of The Forest because I was watching a VH1 special, I think "Where Are They Now", and saw the video box flash across the screen during a segment on the actor Corky Pigeon
He played the male child ghost in this B horror horrible, but I remember him from his character Freddy on the Silver Spoons television show
It actually took me four months to watch it from start to finish
I kept stopping it in boredom, setting it aside and forgetting about it, then stumbling on it and trying once again to get through it
Obviously, the angle of this film that was intended to set it apart from its counterparts was the supernatural element, the apparitions
I kept expecting them to look down at their palms during the longer dialogue scenes in order to read cheat lines
The situation at the beginning where the couples decide to go camping separately is awkward and plain dumb
I guess the only positive thing to say about this one is the scene where the guy falls and breaks his leg, you can see the bone sticking out of his flesh
Man, I'm really reaching for a positive now, huh
The only other no-budget horror film on a level as bad as this one would be Home Sweet Home
I must admit, there are few books with corresponding movies that I have actually read before seeing the cinematic adaptation
Nineteen Eighty-Four happens to be one of those rare cases
It was immersive and interestingly prophetic
It is easily the worst film I have ever seen
The only reason I didn't turn it off after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching the movie was half of a two-part assignment for a class
It was dark and grotesque, but did nothing in the way of achieving the proper atmosphere
The acting was nothing above average, and considering the fact that there wasn't much to act out, this was severely disappointing
The book, for example, didn't give me the impression that Winston was unable to blurt out more than a single syllable at a time
Boring, disturbing, and visually unappealing, the movie totally cannibalized the book
He just seems to stand aside, be urbane and his usual delightful self, but invest nada
It is obvious the girl he is matched with is a featherweight, even as an inexperienced young French girl
Sir Alec wouldn't have chosen her when he was young and very obviously isn't too happy about it now
<br /><br />The interesting character is the brooding brother of the odd "Suzanne", another twit
"Donald" aspires to be a French Heathcliffe and I waited in vain for the source of his mystery
What deep dark secret was he hiding behind that forehead? Was he in love with the father's mistress? Why did he jerk Suzanne's hair when she plotted to bring the disparate parts of this turkey together on the country estate? Or perhaps he had simply had enough of her obnoxious acting
<br /><br />The film would have been charming with Guiness and the "older woman" reminiscing and seeing Paris together
THAT would have been a great story! Two lovely experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of World War II
Why didn't somebody come up with that? I suggest watching Alec Guiness in "The Card", a little known but worthwhile film
I just watched this movie last night, and I HAD to put a warning out for anybody else considering to see this film
I seriously feel like this is something that a screenwriting student would have written in a Quentin Tarantino/Eddie Murphy phase, i
I don't have a problem with profuse cursing, as in "Good Will Hunting", provided it helps to delve more into the characters
In this case it was just hollow banter with the attempt to draw an occassional *gasp* or laughter from the audience
The three lead characters are all their own unique stereotype, the wall street jerk, the coffee house jerk, and the "I'm-Not-Gay-Just-In-Touch-With-My-Feminine-Side" slightly-less-of-a-jerk
You just don't give a damn about any of them! They are all shallow, unredemable losers who you WANT to see lose
For those who dare, this film does have a couple funny moments, the very beginning, and the very end
The toilet/vibrator scene is funny in a sick kinda "Uh, yeah" way
Really though, I would only recommend this film to my worst of enemies
Having endured this inaccurate movie I will admit that it is a more modern telling of the story than previous versions
Yet, it is so inaccurate and has has been made so politically correct that it made me mad after watching it
Davy Crockett was very poorly represented by Billy Bob, who I thought would have probably been better cast as Sam Houston given both men's love of oratory
I think self-absorbed Dennis Quaid(an actual Texan) would have been a perfect Crockett and it would have definitely fed into his starved sense of self-worship
As a Texan and a true believer in the Texas mindset I feel Davy Crockett was the quintessential Texan even though not born here
Our unofficial motto is "It ain't braggin' if it is a fact" was made for Crockett
And that last scene at the Alamo where Crockett is the last survivor has to be the biggest insult to Davy Crockett ever made
To even suggest that this giant of a man and seasoned fighter would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous
Three different eye witness accounts place him dead amid the bodies of a dozen or more dead Mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand to hand combat
Finally, that lame ending to the movie supposedly depicting the battle of San Jacinto as a mutual battle of 600 Texicans vs 700 Mexican Soldiers when there was actually closer to 1,500 well trained Mexican regulars
Every Texas school kid who pays attention in their first Texas history class knows the battle took the Mexican Army by surprise during siesta time and the Mexican army was so confused they could not form ranks and fled as they were not trained to fight frontier style hand to hand
This movie wants to elaborate that criminals are a product of modern society
Therefore, can thieves, rapists and murderers (the Killer of this movie, Carl Panzram (James Woods), is all three and worse) be held fully accountable for their deeds? An interesting notion, but very difficult to bring to the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfying way
And this is where Killer: A Journal of Murder falls very short
Although the film tries to put Panzram's behaviour into perspective, with flashbacks to his violent youth and dysfunctional upbringing, the viewer never gets the idea that Panzram is a victim rather than a culprit
Sure, the system is corrupt, with one mobster occupying the whole sick bay of Leavenworth Prison (where most of the movie takes place), most prison guards are sadistic bullies, and the prison director something like a megalomaniacal despot
But why on earth does new prison guard Henry Lesser (Robert Sean Leonard) take such pity on Panzram? Even after having read his gruesome diaries? The movie offers some explanation: Lesser witnesses Panzram being beaten to a pulp by the most sadistic (and stereotypical) guard, and is impressed by Panzram's intelligence (though it isn't clear why exactly Lesser thinks this man is so smart)
Surely this isn't enough to sympathize with a hostile man like Panzram, even though this movie tends to downplay his crimes and highlight his personality? Towards Lesser, Panzram is quite loyal, and the viewer is given the impression that for Lesser this outweighs all of the atrocities he has read about in Panzram's diaries
Does this man Lesser have so little friends that he takes at face value everyone who seems only remotely friendly to him? Perhaps it is Lesser who is a product of modern society, judging on appearance rather than substance
<br /><br />I can advise Monster, starring Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, as a movie which handles roughly the same themes with far more integrity and scope
<br /><br />BTW: Killer looks as though shot for TV (not so good
In a college dorm a guy is killed by somebody with a scythe
His girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide
A year later she's out, has a new boyfriend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and is about to spend Spring Break with Hank and four other mindless friends in a BIG, beautiful condo in Florida
Naturally the killer pops up (for no reason) and starts killing again
<br /><br />Lousy slasher thriller--a textbook example of how NOT to do a low-budget horror movie
For starters, large portions of this film are ENDLESS filler of these six idiots videotaping themselves, having "fun" (more fun than the audience), getting drunk, acting stupid etc etc
I'm not saying a horror film needs nudity but ANYTHING to liven this up would have helped
None of the deaths are really shown (you hear them), are only a little bloody and there is no gore
There's one REAL gruesome one--but that's not till the end
<br /><br />With a few exceptions the acting sucks
Dorie Barton is dreadful as the main woman and Tom Jay Jones is lousy as Oz
Chad Allen pops up as Brad and he's TERRIBLE
Lawrence is actually very good--handsome and hunky and giving this crap his all
And Jeff Conaway pops up in a small role doing a pretty good job
<br /><br />Logic lapses abound--after they realize a friend has been killed two of the girls casually talk about sex; Baston's non reaction to seeing a friend getting killed is kind of funny and WHAT happens to Lawrence? His character disappears without a trace at the end! Dull, stupid, no gore, no nudity--skip this one
This wasn't the major disaster that I was expecting, but that is about as positive as I can be in my description of the movie
I'm not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie, but I suppose it's all a matter of taste
Personally, I don't find it funny to watch morons living their idiotic lives or making fools of themselves on television, but then again, I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's pathetic daytime talk show
I didn't get too bored watching this, but I was definitely never enjoying it, either
If you're in the mood to see a bad movie, but one that isn't too painful to sit through, this is a good choice
Check out the film's website, more time was put into making that than in the writing of the script for this movie
Original story? Original? They must have found the script tucked away between the old testament, or face legal repercussion for that bit of horn-tooting
High-end special effects? Come on, I could do better with an Atari 7600 and a jug of earwax
Stylish cinematography? Oh yes, the America's funniest home video look is still a classic
I'm sure they had little money available for this title, so of course the sf aren't really that good, or a bit bad now and then, or just plain hilarious, but it's the story that makes this film a waste of time and money
4 stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of seen-befores and done-already's
I had absolutely nothing to do the past weekend, and tagged along with my friends to check out a movie
And since the only movie we'd not seen was Inspector Gadget, we decided to go in for that
This is a movie that might appeal only to kids
Oh, and it's not like I don't enjoy movies targeted at the younger audience
But this movie had absolutely nothing to hold my attention
If you have nothing to do at home, go to sleep
Better than wasting hard-earned cash on this
Go check out the film if you're a kid or if you're a parent with a kid :
As a kid I did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool, however I was a kid and so I was a bit dumb
Even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people
What amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it
What script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale
The plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic
The whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon
The plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix
Dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree
Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars
Well, I can once and for all put an end to the question: 'What is the worst movie ever made
ever?' It is Flight of Fury, starring and co-written by Steven Seagal
Sure there are lots of famously bad movies, but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously
<br /><br />It is a Romanian-made film that speaks to just how far Romania has to go to catch up with Bollywood
It also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent Steven Seagal has become
This movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again
<br /><br />It was released only on video (I can't imagine why) and I suspect the workers that had to make the DVD's had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling
All three stories are bracketed with a psychiatrist hypnotist line which is unnecessary and all the stories are bad
The first is about wild wolves and some lady, there are some things that don't make sense, but the hypnotism thing makes up for that
The second one, with bad Bill Paxton as a maniac roommate should not be viewed by anyone
The last one, sadly the best is almost incomprehensible which I guess makes it better than the other garbage
A young American woman visits her Irish roots and fends off a druid witch who is out to possess her
Sounds intriguing but after an interesting start, I got lost and spent most of the time wondering where it was going
The movie seems to be dithering in two directions -- are we watching the travails of the Irish-American woman battling her alcohol problem or are we watching a straight off horror flick about an evil witch that returns from the past? The director can't seem to decide
The two doesn't seem to gel and in the end you get nowhere
This could be so much better done and the story seemed to drag towards the end
i've seen a movie thats sort of like this, were a transsexual drugs woman and he then picks there nose with a knife and rips there nose to peaces
<br /><br />the most gruesome part of the movie is were he cuts there left eye out and starts dancing with it
<br /><br />(i'm not sure what the movies called but i know it's a cult movie and that it was made in Germany)
<br /><br />anyway THE NOSE PICKER is fairly crap
<br /><br />its a crap movie and the picture and volume quality is very rubbish
<br /><br />please don't waste you're time buying and watching this movie its totally crap
<br /><br />i prefer DAY OF THE WOMAN also known as I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (its one of the best cult movies ever) check out this link http://www
I'm surprised it even has a theatrical release
WIthout Robin Williams it would have gone straight to video
It's worse offense is that it has taken an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and BORING thriller that has no thrills and no suspense and no inner or emotional logic
Especially after the first half hour the movie dovetails into a series of ridiculous set pieces that are so over the top that the audience I saw it with was laughing at it
The trailer is totally misleading - it is not suspenseful and there are no thrills - in fact the movie's truly worst offense is that it is simply boring
- A Mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something -<br /><br />I went to see this movie because it was about non-WWF wrestling and so I thought it might be funny
Any and every opportunity for comedy is mercilessly squandered
<br /><br />I admit I don't like Jack Black anyway
After this I have been racking my brain to think of one good role that he has performed
The only thing I can come up with where he was o
was as a necessary foil to the John Cusack character in 'High Fidelity'
Jack Black is one of those awful relentless flat-out ham-it-up knockabout guys (like the little fat one in Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis) who should be told that being overbearingly idiotic is not the same thing as being funny
<br /><br />I heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite too, but if this is anything to go by I wont be rushing out to find it on DVD
The premise was intriguing, but sadly this film just doesn't do any justice to it
The casting was quite good, and it was shot beautifully - but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent (overstylized fast editing been there done that to no effect
I was waiting for Steven Bochco to run in the credits followed by a commercial), characters were identified exclusively by on-screen coke usage (and pretty much everything else left to Boogie Nights for character development), and no personable characters to draw the viewer into the story
but believe me, this movie spoils itself from start to finish
<br /><br />I walked into this movie with high expectations
I had put too much stock in Steve Carell's record to date
And I also made the mistake of coming to IMDb and seeing a 7
It's always been a very good predictor in the past, but something is definitely off lately
The last time I felt this embarrassed and in this much pain in a movie theater was watching "Blue Steel" in 1990
<br /><br />This flick fumbled from start to finish
"Murderer of love"? "Love is an ability"? Whoever wrote this crap suffered from the same affliction that struck American Beauty's writer(s)
The entire flick was peppered with Three's Company'ish moments like the awful and contrived shower scene
Or the pointless/confusing aerobics scene
Right when you think something serious and/or real is about to happen, they toss in one of these terrible moments
And it happens over and over and over again
<br /><br />And what's with Carell's character? The guy meets some lame broad at a book store and is suddenly head over heels in love? Let's face it
They both should have said their goodbye's after a few minutes
Pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune of watching this movie
Carell's character is trying to say something which is absolutely random and un-funny (I think the exact line was "this one time when I was a kid"
seriously), but both are laughing so hard that coffee is about to spout out of their noses
The actors themselves looked like they were in pain, wondering why they're being directed to do what they're doing
you guys need to figure out a way to keep a movie's promotional team off this site
I know it's impossible, but it's painfully obvious the first 20 or so ratings/reviews were either posted by 12 year olds, or by flunky's hired by the studio
if that's a mid 5, then this absolutely has got to be a 2
But what good does it do if the content is hollow and foolish
I have left after < than 30 minutes of watching, being bored and irritated
<br /><br />The theatre administration returned my money, but the time waisted and aggravation remained
I have been had and no thanks to the stars whose names were the main attraction
<br /><br />George, Meryl, Bill - I hope you were well paid
<br /><br />Wish to know - what is remotely redeeming in a story about Mr Fox the husband, the father, the citizen, the
This is far worse than those awful Laurel and Hardy cartoons of the 60s
They were terrible, but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then Stan and Ollie resurgence
New audiences had rediscovered the pair's comedic genius and the cartoons were mind-numbing garbage geared to cash in on children's interest
But, how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of
I'm sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another Laurel and Hardy revival, but you can't inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing
The impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) do a Vegas act and that's where it belongs
The plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days, trying to stretch out two-reel ideas for a feature
If this film was someone's first exposure to the REAL Laurel and Hardy, I'm sure that viewer would dismiss the original duo's reputation as senility gone amok
The only movie I hate worse than this is I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE
And, you know, these filmmmakers basically did the same thing to Stan and Ollie
You do realize that you've been watching the EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years, right? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co-exist on an Island, but you'd think that after watching unkempt, stink-ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original (and interesting)
<br /><br />And I'm not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record I find questionable
It's just hard to suspend disbelief for "Bushy Bill" eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make-shift bio-dome sipping frosty mochcinno's with moxy
<br /><br />What's the appeal here? I don't care about these people or their meandering lives
But if you DO find yourself being captivated by hairy, unwashed people, I suggest you turn off your TV and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their TRUE habitat
They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE, and free of charge, you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters, eventually striking "pay-dirt" and fashioning a homemade Dr
Frankenstein-styled cancer-stick, all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of "Aqua Velva" on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise
And the best part? Much like Survivor, every week one member of the tribe "Leaves" the "Island" when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local Institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full-blown schizophrenia kicks into gear! Now THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT
Sarah Silverman is really the "flavor of the month" comic right now
Is she really worth all the hype? Yes and no
She is funny at times, sometimes hilariously so (her standup routine is actually quite interesting, though not always funny)
Other times, you're feeling cheated by the media for overhyping yet another performer
She is one of those really cute comedians that men especially flock to, saying that they dig her intelligence and wit
But if you corner them, most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her, and that's why they watch her
She reminds me of why many men flocked to Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, even though neither of them are really "hot" now in terms of popularity
Sarah doesn't drink or smoke (at least cigs), so she should be hot when she's 60, so her fans (especially the male ones) can rejoice
<br /><br />As for this show, it's very much like her comedy
When it doesn't, it's full blown tedium and very, very boring
It's consistently funny, and has some really good satire in it
Brian Poeshn's character has an unhealthy obsession with Tab in one episode, and it's hilarious seeing him in a Tab T-shirt
But they never really go anywhere with it, and it eventually wears out its welcome
Sarah's character in the series is rather annoying, the gay couple (Brian Poeshn and some other guy) seems tacked on and never really does anything for the show as a whole, and the supporting players (including Sarah's real life sister, Laura, who doesn't look a thing like her) are OK
When they don't, they're awful, and I mean really awful
There's also an obsession with coprophilia here (aka poop jokes), which seems to have replaced actual wit and intelligence in comedy today
So should you watch this show? If you have a crush on Sarah, go for it
You can gaze at her and pretend she's yours
As for her show, it's ranges from good to absolute zero
I've always been enthusiastic about period dramas, an art form in which the BBC has excelled in the past
This presentation of "Byron" was unbelievable
Unbelievably bad! The script was dreadful, the acting uninspired, and all the characters woefully insipid
Apparently Byron was "mad bad and dangerous to know", and set the ladies hearts all-a-flutter
Here he appeared as a tawdry jumped-up little squirt instead of a fiery hero of womenfolk and the Greek struggle for independence
This portrayal of the man was just limp all over
<br /><br />I watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to spark into life
It was utter tedium, if not downright boredom, from start to finish
<br /><br />Having the opinion that no-one will ever better the Bard of Avon, I also believe that Byron's poetry is over-revered and to my mind should be flung on the back burner, and this dramatisation of his life should be accorded the same treatment
<br /><br />I think the BBC lost its nous with this on
I expected a bad movie, and got a bad movie
But I couldn't really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was
I don't even want to try to explain what Blood Surf is about
Is not about blood surfing, but a big a$$ crocodile
They are complaining about the fake shark in Jaws, but Spielberg was wise and didn't show the shark until the end
Here the crocodile is shown a lot of times, and it's the worst fake crocodile I have ever seen, and they don't try to hide it
If you want to see a good fake crocodile watch Lake Placid
<br /><br />The director had an opportunity to make a decent surf/shark movie, but he had to make a bad b-monster movie
He had the chance to make an original surf movie, but he wanted to make a monster movie
So you have understand how bad this movie is, does it have some good parts? Not really, it got some nudity, and a sex scene that is taken straight out of a playboy movie
The acting isn't half bad either, and Kate Fischer looks good
The location was beautiful and the movie start good with some nice surf scenes
The blame is on the untalented writer and director
The dialogue is some of the worst I have ever seen, and the script is really badly written, and the director got no talent what so ever, and not much of a fantasy either
Even if you want to watch the beautiful Kate Fischer
Watch Sirens to watch Kate nude, and watch Lake Placid if you want some good crocodile action
<br /><br />3/10 because I'm in a good mood, and Maureen Larrazabal looks good naked, and Kate looks good (but is bad actress,)and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi did a good job with the piece of sh#t they had to work with
From the What Was She Thinking? file: Whoopi Goldberg plays a cop in the future who is teamed with a talking dinosaur (!) for a crime case involving a madman who wants to start another ice-age
Straight-to-tape oddity is embarrassing and ridiculous, a high-concept in search of itself
Apparently this was a labor of love for its writer-director, Jonathan Betuel (who also served as one of the producers); sadly, the end results are anemic, to be charitable
Goldberg's mere presence on-screen can often spark good will and laughter no matter how poor the script, but here she's drowning and you can see the unfunny results
I'd heard about this movie a while ago from a friend and she recently got it on DVD
There was a lot of anticipation and excitement as we'd both heard that this was a terrifying film, really scary
How disappointed was I?? VERY!!!! Apart from that one scene (we all know which bit) NOTHING happened!!! I was expecting to see the woman in black a few times and for her to do a few more jumpy scenes, like appear at the window or walk across the hall or something
<br /><br />Nearly all the reviews here say what a scary, gripping, atmospheric movie this is
Maybe there's a difference in what people find scary in the US to here in Britain
<br /><br />A big let down after all the hyped reviews :
Wow, I love and respect pretty much anything that David Lynch has done
However, this movie is akin to a first filmmaker's attempt at making a pseudo art video
<br /><br />To give you a couple of examples: <br /><br />1
David Lynch is typically a visual filmmaker, however, this had little visual artistic content (blank walls, "up shots" with ceiling in the background) <br /><br />2
David Lynch typically takes great pride in audio, however, in this you could even hear the video camera's hum
<br /><br />In fact, it is very hard to swallow the idea that he had anything to do with this movie
this is a joke, on David's part, to force fans search his website (for hours) only to find this drivel
I hope so, because at least that idea is funny
This is a typical Steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds
I wouldn't call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a Steele novel knows how they ALL end
If you don't want to know much about the plot, don't keep reading
<br /><br />Gilbert's character, Ophelia, is a woman of French decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident
Gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she, otherwise a good actress, cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent
Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce
He is gentle, convincing and compelling in this role
<br /><br />The two meet on the beach through her daughter, Pip, and initially, Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid
All of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love
<br /><br />The chemistry between the two leads is not great, even though the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question
They did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical
Two people meet, tragedy, bigger tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they get together
I wish there was more to it than that, but there it is in a nutshell
<br /><br />I wanted mindless entertainment, and I got it with this
In regard to the genre of romantic films, this one fails to be memorable
"A Secret Affair" with Janine Turner is far superior (not a Steele book), as are some of Steele's earlier books turned into film
Beyond dirt cheap, this shot-on-video exercise in ineptitude was difficult to get through
It's got the typical gore that you'd expect in a zombie movie, but none of the required atmosphere to make it worth while
<br /><br />What's strange is that this is an amateur German video, and the version I saw is English-dubbed! The dubbers seem to be American fans (penpals of the Germans?!) who can't decide whether they want to play it straight or turn it into a comedy
One character (a white German, of course) is dubbed by a black guy apparently, who speaks with thick ebonics! 'Kno wahm sayin', Comrad
I'm a huge fan of war movies, and, as a Vietnam combat vet, have some experience with the technical details
I worked with the bomb guys more than once and have nothing but respect for them
Other vets, and Iraq vets in particular, have summarized the inaccuracies in this movie very well
Poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy, and fails badly because of it
No bomb disposal unit, or any unit, would ever have tolerated this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes
Military units prize conformity and discipline for a reason;it saves lives
The opening scene particularly annoyed me
The guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately
Yelling, "Stop dialing" is not an effective deterrent
The scenes with the sniper were particularly egregious
As others have noted, your average EOD guy doesn't know jack about being a sniper, and to think any Arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination
Kidnapping an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just wouldn't happen
Somebody might shoot him, but this kind of risk-taking is limited to the movies
I could go on, but, as I said, others have pointed these things out in detail
This is not a good movie, and if it wins any awards at all, it's a further reflection of why "La La land" is so named
I don't know where to start; the acting, the special effects and the writing are all about as bad as you can possibly imagine
I can't believe that the production staff reached a point where they said, "Our job is done, time for it's release"
I'm just glad the first two in the series never made it as far as the UK
I would actually recommend watching this film just so you can appreciate how well made most films are
<br /><br />I don't know how any of the other IMDb users could find it scary when the "terrifying" dinosaurs waddle down corridors with rubber arms flailing around
I just saw this movie, and I have to say that it was a big waste of time
The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) can't act at all
She read her lines very un-naturally, and she had a very un-natural facial expression through the entire movie
Rosanna Munter who played Petra on the other hand, is a natural
She played her part with great perfection
<br /><br />SPOILERS! The story was simple - we've seen it many, many times before
She breaks up, he finds another, she get jealous, he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end
There were no surprises at all, one knew that Eva would break up, and that Adam would "hook up" with Petra
The only thing that nobody saw coming was that Petra told Adam to go after Eva at the party
She became all serious, which is a side of Petra the viewers hadn't seen earlier in the movie, and told him to win Eva's heart back, which was really cute
<br /><br />Besides Rosanna Munter, there isn't a single actor who gives a memorable performance
<br /><br />This is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors, so I don't recommend it
i searched video store everywhere to find this movie, being the huge elvis fan that i am, and i found it to be a huge disappointment
kurt russel had most of the "elvis moves" down and the voice imitation was great, but the dubbed in singing voice of elvis just didnt work for me
the voice didnt always match up with russels mouth, and it was hard for me to get lost in the plot because it bothered me that it was noticeable
also, there were so many freaking discrepancies in the film, people who dont know much about elvis would probably think them to be facts
songs are sung by him earlier than he recorded them in real life, the time when he got his first guitar is wrong, im pretty sure his brother jesse garron was buried in an unmarked grave, not one with a huge headstone reading JESSE GARRON
i know it was just a tv movie, but they skipped over important events, like the come-back-special, and dragged some scenes out for way too long
if you want to see a good movie that shows elvis in his prime rent THATS THE WAY IT IS, or another elvis concert
hearing and seeing the real elvis preform is the only way to truly see his talent
<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh's was most ambitious, Mel Gibson's was quick and to the point, Laurence Olivier's was the best - hands down
But now we come to Maximilian Schell's take on the Bard
<br /><br />For one, this is a dubbed version of a German TV production of William Shakespeare's venerable chestnut
But if there's a slower, more plodding, more lethargic and worse-staged version out there somewhere, it must have been acted at grade school-level
<br /><br />Having seen it on MST3K helps, with Mike and the robots taking jolly good jabs at the old boy, puncturing the profundity of black and white TV, Shakespeare and the wisdom (?) of Germans acting out an English play and making it look like an Ingmar Bergman reject
<br /><br />Of course, the best parts are the MST riffs
Best lines? "I'm gonna unleash the Great Dane", "I don't think so, 'breather'", "Meet the Beatles", "Hey, Dad, will you help me with my science project" and, my personal favorite, during a party - "Garrison Keillor's leaving Germany (YAAAY!!)"
<br /><br />But then there's Schell, playing Shakespeare's greatest character much like a department store mannequin would, only not as expressive
No doubt he's a great actor, but here he comes off about as well as Paul Newman in "The Silver Chalice"
Ever see that one? You GOTTA watch these two on a double-bill!<br /><br />In the end, this is one instance where it's true that you're much better off to just read the book
At least the book isn't dubbed by Ricardo Montalban
<br /><br />One star only for this "Hamlet"; ten stars, naturally, for the MST3K version
<br /><br />Good-night, not-so-sweet prince
This film on paper looked like it could possibly be good, after watching though i realised that this film was completely terrible!! The plot has no meaning, and i think i counted the best part of 5000 cut scenes each one making the film more annoying boring and ridiculous
I watched this late night pitch black no noise at all just to add to the SCARINESS of it but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music, what they would call tragic music, they play opera i mean be serious!! This film sums up all of what is not good about this type of film
To be honest ill say no more but watch at your own risk this film is just complete rubbish, ENJOY!
You might be a bit confused if you watch this silly made-for from the beginning, since the credits list Susan Dey as "Special Guest Star
" Um, why would a one-off MOW like this have a guest star? Well, if you stick with it, you'll find yourself paying attention to little else but Ms
Dey's butt, wiggling in a flowered bikini as the "Partridge Family" house babe frolics on the beach to which that imaginative title alludes
Susan's derrière is especially compelling when she shakes it at the camera while teasing and tickling her pseudo-disaffected brother in one mildly incestuous scene
Sadly, Susie and her tush fight a losing battle: the jiggle-TV craze that might have put that bottom over the top was three years off, so that sweet booty just gets a supporting role
In 1976 Fat Freddy Silverman would have put that behind right out front and used this flick as Susan's audition tape for "Charlie's Angels
" As is, our Susan was denied cheesecake immortality and had to settle for a very commendable career playing somber, neurotic women
<br /><br />The view beyond Susan's heinie, it must be said, is not very compelling
The scenery is nice, and photographed in a bizarre, hazy way that briefly fools you into thinking there might be some quirky creative intelligence at work behind the camera
It's just a typically suspense-challenged 70's made-for-TV thriller that allowed weekly series stars to make some extra cash(and collect some cable residuals, though they obviously didn't know that at the time) and show off their "range
" Here we're treated to a TV-scale nuclear family, squaring off against TV-scale thugs who can't decide whether they're a motorcycle gang or a hippie cult (thus the filmmakers split the difference by putting them in dune buggies) and have never learned one of the primary lessons of 1970s television: don't mess with Dennis Weaver (see "McCloud" and "Duel")
The only potential for depth in this movie is in the aforementioned teenage-son character of Steve, played by the long-forgotten (if ever-remembered) Kristoffer Tabori, who is supposed to be rebellious and troubled and might feel some sympathy for and attraction to the lawless mob that is (supposedly) menacing his family
But Steve, as played by Tabori (gosh, why didn't we see more from this wunderkind?), is actually just grumpy and moody and isn't one bit conflicted when big D gets serious and draws a line in the proverbial (and literal) sand
For the sleep-deprived and Susan Deyniacs (there must be some of you out there) only
This movie is a mess, but at least it's not pretentious
The box art for the video markets it as a "fun throwback" to 1950s giant bug movies
In reality, it's a transparent bargain basement ripoff of "Aliens"
<br /><br />The producers clearly wanted to make an "ALIEN" picture, but they mustn't have had much money
In fact, it doesn't look like they had ANY money, really
I hope everyone got paid who worked on this thing
<br /><br />The basic plot is retained--group of people isolated with murderous insectoid creature--and an earthbound location is inserted for budgetary reasons, I presume
Instead of setting the film in space, where no one can hear you scream, they set the film in a hospital, where everyone can see your budget laid bare
The amusing thing about "Blue Monkey" (and there is only one thing amusing about it) is, the filmmakers didn't abandon the "ALIEN" aesthetics
Even though we're in a hospital, we still have an improbably cavernous annex where science fiction experiments are being conducted, in this case the venerable "growth hormone" plot device
The annex also doubles as a boiler room (or something), so we can have an explanation for the monster seeking out the warmth
The boiler room is so large that it is laced with multi-leveled steel catwalks, perfect for allowing slime to drip down between the slats
<br /><br />The idea is that a man working in a greenhouse is attacked by a drooping flower from a rare imported plant that grows in an exotic location
He touches it and says "Ow", so we know he's been hurt
The cut on his finger causes him to lapse into unconsciousness in a matter of minutes, and at the hospital he gives birth to a white worm through his mouth (I guess in an "ALIEN" picture this would be called the "mouthburster"?)
The worm is isolated, but some naughty little kids (leukemia patients) sneak up on it and "accidentally" give it some experimental growth hormone
You know everyone's in trouble when some fornicating hospital staff workers are attacked by a camera on a crane, and pretty soon a maintenance man finds some obligatory cocoons, right before he's grabbed by a pair of semi-convincing insectoid arms
The rest of the movie is dominated by the semi-offscreen monster, semi-obscured by the semi-darkness
<br /><br />Which brings us back to "ALIEN"
How, you ask, can a movie set in a hospital incorporate all those flashing strobe lights that are always in the "ALIEN" movies? No problem
a power outage (or something) causes the electrical system to go awry, which apparently causes strobe lights to blossom in every room of the hospital and flicker constantly throughout the movie
This doubles as a convenient cloak for the less-than-special effects (although the bugs are pretty neat looking, they don't move too well, and the baby bug looks charmingly like a Cootie toy)
<br /><br />OK, so what "ALIEN" bases haven't we covered
we'll divide the massive hospital into two parts, then send some of the characters through the damp, drippy basement to get to the other side
Problem solved, we now have the opportunity for numerous "foreboding tunnel" shots
well, you never really need an excuse for this in horror movies, do you? OK, maybe inside of a hospital you do, so we'll create smoke by having lots of things spark & burn
<br /><br />I haven't said anything about the negligible acting, not that the actors are given any kind of script to follow
I take it "Blue Monkey" was supposed to be lighthearted and fun, and if so then it is a nice try, but the pieces don't come together and the movie ends up being a real drag
See a film called "Return of the Aliens: The Deadly Spawn" if you want to see a film of this type that gets it right, with even less money and even more marginal acting talent
I love the munna bhai MBBS but "Lagge raho
I have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life
And these high ratings really astonished me that wat happened to the taste of Indian cinema viewers ?? <br /><br />**MAY BE SPOILER** <br /><br />An educated girl needs an advice from a Bhai, people discussing their personal prob
on phones come on man from which part of the world u r ??? I agree that films should be fictitious but these things are really indigestible
If Fassbinder has made a worse film, I sure don't want to see it! Anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to view this, to learn to appreciate the more spare style he opted for in excellent films like "The Bitter Tears Of Petra von Kant"
This film bogs down with so much arty, quasi-symbolic images it looks like a parody of an "art-film"
The scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where Elvira's prostitute friend channel-surfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer's endurance
But what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just Elvira and her ex-wife and/or her daughter
These are the only moments that display any real human emotion, and prove that at the core of this horrible film, there was an excellent film struggling to free itself
The only way one could explain something like this is a porn party with drugs that resulted in the resolution to make a movie just for fun
I mean: you get to see porn actresses topless, having sex, then killed by human mutants
There is plenty of gore, including the classic "something is wrong with her, oh no, it's half the person she used to be" and the accidental murder caused by panic
But you can also find funny stuff like intestines pulled through someone's ass and a guy running in the woods then finding himself decapitated by a wire tied between two trees (that makes a metallic doiiing sound afterward, like in cartoons)
Somehow there is a market for people going beyond porn, they really need to know what's inside an actress, mere genitals are not enough
Therefore you get to see plenty of summary autopsies on slain bimbos
Jenna and Chasey have really small parts and I really wonder what Richard Grieco wanted when accepting a role here
I think this is a film one must watch with the button on fast forward and watch only the juicy stuff, just to be reminded of the old school C class horror movies
<br /><br />I was watching my local Sci-fi station last night, which plays movies, every night, within a monthly theme
This month it's "Space Turkeys, Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bombs"
Movies so bad, they should never have been made
<br /><br />Everything about this movie is thoroughly horrible with two exceptions, the gore make-up (which showed potential) and the editing (which slightly out did the rest of the movie, in terms of being horrible)
The acting is horrible all around, the dialog is horrible, the script, the direction
<br /><br />It consists of two forms of special effects, gore and stock footage of space
Watching this movie, I thought to myself, "What WAS the motivation behind the making of this movie?" People like making stuff, sure, but I was hesitant to think anything good could have come of it for anyone involved
I came to the conclusion that this movie was made as a means to increase the Make-up Effects guy's Demo Reel
He (Rick Baker) actually went on to a pretty nice career, he's worked on STAR WARS (1977), KING KONG (1976), MEN IN BLACK (1996), and even THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN (1981), plus a number of other notable flicks
Other than that, I can't say I've ever actually SEEN a real, live melting man - incredible, or otherwise - but I'd have to say this seemed to be a fair representation of one
<br /><br />Now, when I think of bad editing, I usually think of maybe a scene where someone's talking on the phone and then, in the middle of the scene, the phone jumps down to his shoulder, or something to that effect
This movie really serves to highlighted the fact that bad editing can take many forms
Specifically, over-long and utterly useless scenes
Just about every scene dragged on longer than it should have, from a little bit of dead air to that crazy-long screaming scene with Cleaver Girl
And that severed head in the river, the head gets thrown into a river (in slow motion), the movie carries on for a couple minutes, and then we cut back to the floating head and watch it fall down a waterfall
While I'm sure they were all very proud of their severed head, WHAT THE HELL??<br /><br />Lastly, I'll mention the running fat lady/slow motion scene right near the beginning
The jerky slow motion tells me that they didn't shoot the scene in slow motion originally but later decided that it "wasn't working like that" and then slowed it down
In any event, if you should ever see another movie in which a hysterical fat woman runs down a hall and then directly through a closed, glass door - all in slow motion, mind you - remember THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN, for *this* is where it all started
<br /><br />Movies like this are best viewed at home with a bunch of friends
This one's a little slow most of the time but that's just all the more time to come up with your own one-liners
It's not the worst of the worst but it's pretty freaking bad
There are three movies with this animation style that I fondly remember from my youth
This movie, "The Last Unicorn," "Flight of Dragons" and "The Hobbit
" I own copies of both "Dragons" and "The Hobbit" (both excellent) and I hadn't seen "The Last Unicorn" in more than a decade
That was until today and now I wish I hadn't
Things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation
We're not just talking about little things here either; we're talking about key plot points! The story itself isn't that great to begin with, but it could have worked had the script been decent
On top of that the music was awful! I know that music in movies such as these rarely have what one would call classic pieces, but the music in this movie made me want to knock myself unconscious with a bowling ball
This was one of those films that I was going to show to my kids some day, but it just got cut
I don't think I could ever sit through that crap fest again
First of all, I ain't American or Middle-Eastern
The closest thing to a religion I have are sports and movies
Henceforth, I believe I would be best served to supply an opinion of neutrality and free from bias
<br /><br />Most of these short films are an utter disgrace
This dreadful event should be used to commemorated all those innocent people whom were murdered by "some" barbaric and uncivilized morons
Instead, most of what I saw in these short films were conceited attempts to score varied political points
Examples:<br /><br />1) Ken Loach's segment
Sure, we are all sad that this dude had a hard life in his country but what has that got to do with the innocent victims of 2001? Two wrongs don't make a right?! Whatever! This film should have a subtitle for those who have trouble listening to a partially incoherent Chilean-English accent
<br /><br />2) Most disturbing is Youssef Chahine's segment
It is obvious that he has trouble with logic
He justified the murders due to - America being a democracy and because some Americans voted the politicians in power, then all Americans in the end are responsible for the actions and decisions made by their leaders on the Middle-East
Helloooo! Is this guy for real?? Some Americans don't even vote! Some Americans don't even know where the Middle-East is; some don't even know what religion is practiced there; and majority don't know the real political issues that are played behind the scenes
### Mr Chahine, the reason why we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind of logic
The innocent victims in the Twin Towers came from around the world
The murdered firefighters, rescuers, office workers, by-standers and flight passengers have nothing to do with politics
And yet, we are not allowed to go about our lives because "some" people think everyone has to choose a side or a religion
We are perceived as fair game for the extreme politics
<br /><br />3) The Israeli segment showed their own bombed victims
Another filmmaker using this event to push their own political agenda
Some people always think about the "me, me, me
<br /><br />4) Idrissa Ouedraogo's segment is a joke and another political point scorer
They obviously want money from the international community by highlighting their poverty
<br /><br />This movie denigrates the memory of "Sept
<br /><br />The best thing for it is the TRASH CAN
I should have known I was in trouble with Casper Van Diem as the lead character
Words cannot describe, nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was
But please allow me to try to describe it: Horrible acting, terrible dialog, corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being force-fed the beliefs and propeganda from the Trinity Broadcasting Network
Its a weak attempt at trying to show Hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep, religious message attached to it
It was clearly the worst movie I have seen in a long time
This movie is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen
From the very first scene, i knew it would be a smash crash
It starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission
As it turns out, the people in it were possessed by some random zombies
Well, some years later, some college kids are pulling some pledge prank
Horrible acting goes from pledge to the head jock
Things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a non-chalonte manner, with pledge over reacting and over-doing the whole "eager to be popular role" What really took the cake with this one is the final battle
Absolutely HORRIBLE special effects with the guns
For example, guns making a noise with no muzzle flash, and vice-versa
this is accompanied by stop-animation zombies (why they move in stop motion is a mystery), cheesy music, and about 40 guns that come out of nowhere
Just like so many others you can rent for 50 cents at your nearest low brow movie rental place
Devil Hunter gained notoriety for the fact that it's on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but it really needn't have been
Many films on the list where there for God (and DPP) only known reasons, and while this isn't the tamest of the bunch; there isn't a lot here that warrants banning
which is a shame because I never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that it's on 'the shopping list'
The plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films - and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the Amazon jungle
A hunter is then hired to find her, but along the way he has to brave the natives, lead by a man who calls himself "The Devil" (hence the title)
The film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really aren't many scenes of interest
It's a real shame that Jess Franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent; as seen by films such as The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and Devil Hunter is very much a part of the crap
I saw this film purely because I want to be able to say I've seen everything on the DPP's list (just two more to go!), and I'm guessing that's why most other people who have seen it, saw it
But if you're not on the lookout for Nasties; there really is no reason to bother with this one
Over-looking its flaws this is still an interesting account of the famed and heroic siege of the Alamo during the Texas fight for independence from Mexico
This made-for-TV project also stars David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler
Very good original music by Peter Bernstein
I enjoyed parts of the third year even, and I watched every episode of the fourth year, totally faithfully in great hopes that it would somehow turn around
<br /><br />I watched the Caprica pilot and was enthralled
Then I started watching the regular episodes, and they are getting more and more boring
<br /><br />It's too obvious, too predictable
It reminds me of the droll political correctness of his last failed show, Virtuality
<br /><br />Much of his line work on DS9 was good
When he focused on BSG in an organized way, it was good
This was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first BSG series
When they departed from that after meeting up with Admiral Cain and the Pegasus, it all went to pot
It was like he wrote the rest of the show without knowing where he was going
Maybe it was just a few weak initial episodes
Tierney's an authentic tough guy, but this movie misfire from normally competent RKO undercuts his impact at every turn
The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner
Just count the times Tierney's incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts
The old cliché about it "only happening in the movies" applies here in spades
Then there's the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy, ruining the menacing mood in the process
The static one-room sets don't help either, and neither does director Feist's obvious lack of feel for the material
Then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty flat
In fact the movie only picks up in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants
Too bad that Tieney's career never really gelled
I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another
His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best
Anyway this project might have worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's a disappointment
A pretty worthless made for television movie that pretty much follows the killer insect script
Ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near a hotel
I think it is from the hotel food because the sewage from the hotel kitchen drains directly into the ant bed
There is a lack of suspense in this film and it is not scary either
Watching a bunch of ants sting their victims is not very terrifying
<br /><br />Spoilers section The stupidity of the hero is near incredible
He is told that the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero
After the inspector says this, the hero takes his bulldozer and wrecks the huge ant colony
This disturbs the millions of ants and traps the people in the hotel
<br /><br />End spoilers Overall, this movie is extremely lame
I don't understand why it got a DVD release when so many deserving movies have none
My only guess for the DVD release is that Suzanne Summers is featured in the film
This so-called prequel is just a badly made remake to to a better version of Dangerous Liasons
The plots are identical as is most of the script
I loved the book its based off of, and I loved the first movie, but I'm not even going to bother with the 3rd movie
The pointless banter between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal, and
I just can't stress how bad the movie was
If you don't want to take my word for it, just watch it, and you'll see what I mean
If you've read a review that says that 'If you likes the first one, you'll like the second one' the only reason that is is because IT IS THE EXACT SAME MOVIE! Although the plot is not even as good
They took so many lines from the first movie, Its hard to tell which movie you're watching
The movie had so much potential, but due to 70's technology constraints and also a weak script killed the main plot of the film
The book version of the film was much better, and well conceived
If it had been done right in the beginning with sources from the book, it could have been a very cool classic
I'm not sure quite why I clicked "contains spoiler", because quite honestly there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough of what is supposed to be going on to spoil it
Well, apart from some 80's throwback rubber-mask monsters
I'll say now that before watching this I had never seen the band Lordi, nor knew anything about them bar that they won Eurovision
Apparently the monsters in this are members of the band, pretty much in their stage personas
Anyway, I didn't know this while watching
I just thought the monsters/demons were mostly passable
<br /><br />I'm almost sure there is a semi-coherent explanation behind what we see on-screen, but it may actually be better not to know it
It probably would actually have been incredibly lame come to think on it
The action keeps it rolling along pretty much well enough to keep the viewer mostly entertained, even if half the entertainment factor is joking about wtf is supposed to be happening in this movie exactly
<br /><br />I gave it a four mainly because I got a good laugh out of it, especially out of how it explains pretty much nothing
Must have been the mood I was in, but I found that hella funny for some reason
Then I look up the movie on the internet and find out that NOBODY knows what the hell it's supposed to be about
That amused me further, and raised my score an extra half point to a 4/10
<br /><br />It's not scary, or particularly coherent, but it's pretty nice visually and sonically
Overall, far from essential, but watchable
Don't expect too much and don't expect it to make any sense and it might entertain you if you are in the right mood
I think that the shots and lighting were very poor
When I watched it for the first time I thought it was the old version(1956)
When I really found out the true year of the film I was shocked
I didn't know that there could be such a bad film made so recently
This film had a good plot though, nothing you couldn't miss out on if you would simply read the novel that George Orwelll wrote
All I really want to say has already been said except for this: I can't believe that this film could have possibly received so many awards and nominations
I gave this film a One (awful), because I felt that it was very badly made
I'll just be vague about my potential spoiling comments
There are enough canned plot elements in this movie that it's essentially pre-spoiled
<br /><br />This movie derives a few ideas from a Southern classic, To Kill A Mockingbird
I suppose maybe TKOM got its ideas from some source
at any rate, after you watch this, you'll say, "Oh yeah, that is a ripoff"
<br /><br />I think the truly entertaining thing about these McMovies is once you've identified a plot element, is to figure out whether they'll stick with the original, or try to twist it around
v the other day, and I didn't enjoy it at all
The first George of the jungle was a good comedy, but the sequel
The new actor and actress to play the lead roles weren't good at all, they should of had the original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and original actress (i forgot her name) so this movie gets the 0 out of ten rating, not a film that you can sit down and watch and enjoy, this is a film that you turn to another channel or take it back to the shop if hired or bought
It was good to see Ape the ape back, but wasn't as fun as the first, they should of had the new George as Georges son grown up, and still had Bredon and (whats her face) in the film, that would've been a bit better then it was
I have been grewing up with Pippi and every time was a real pleasure
when my wife came to Sweden she was looking at the oldies and had a real good laugh
but this American version should be renamed and never be shown again
it is terrible from beginning to it's end
well I guess someone blames the translation ha ha ha
may this movie never been seen again and never sent out on a broadcast
if you want to look at Pippi then look at the original movie and have a good laugh
WE LOVE PIPPI INGER NILSSON, sorry Tami Erin you will never stand up to be Pippi
when read the "spoilers" explanation, "'spoiling' a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film
" well I guess the director stands for this
you are looking at this movie at your own risk
Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, I thought I was in for a treat when I took home "My Wrongs
" (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, "a short film including scenes")
I should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twoddle
<br /><br />The scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock
How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand
<br /><br />The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case here
Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs
This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid
<br /><br />To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement
It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled
Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated
<br /><br />The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being irritating
If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend "Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life", by Peter Capaldi
I have been known to fall asleep during films, but this is usually due to a combination of things including, really tired, being warm and comfortable on the sette and having just eaten a lot
However on this occasion I fell asleep because the film was rubbish
Things seemed to happen, but with no explanation of what was causing them or why
I admit, I may have missed part of the film, but i watched the majority of it and everything just seemed to happen of its own accord without any real concern for anything else
To the small minority seen here praising this film GET SERIOUS
I know it's down to peoples personal opinion at the end of the day, but anyone with more than a couple of brain cells can surely see that this is total rubbish
So bad it does not deserve to be part of this franchise
I can only assume those saying how great this is are friends with somebody involved in the film and are trying to give their career a push
Poor in every way, don't con people by saying otherwise
Storyline is a weak rehash of the previous entries, script is likewise
Attempts to hide the lack of originality by using a girl instead (WOW!) don't disguise the film-makers lack of ideas,and there is sadly a complete lack of any scares
Absolutely no redeeming qualities, utter utter turd
I've awarded this pair of chancers one mark simply for having had the nous to get someone to fund this piece of crap
They must have put more effort into that than they did into actually making the film
This is exactly the sort of Saturday matinee serial I loved during World War II
And that's the audience this serial is designed for
Looking at it now, one must roar at its ineptitude and stupidity
The budget must have been next to nothing, given the shortcuts and repeats
The acting? Well, this is Republic pictures, 1944
and no doubt had one take to make them convincing
First and foremost, Zorie Barber (Zeke), might be one of the worst actors I have ever seen
As a character that's supposed to be a hip, Village writer into the martial arts and proud of being mysterious, why is he so hyper, over-dramatic, and plain horrible? Did he know anything about his character before they started filming? Did the director? Don't the martial arts teach discipline? Aside from that, this film misses the target with its lame jokes and seen-it-already gross-out humor
<i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>, <i>American Pie</i>, the list goes on
Bad dialogue: In one sequence, Eric says "it's none of my business <i>but</i>
" and 30 seconds later Mia says "why is this any of your business?" Bad editing: At least five minutes worth of film are wasted on NYC traffic shots
<hr>It's also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a tight-knit group of friends in any world
I can't comment on what makes everyone laugh, but if you enjoy low-brow, basic bathroom humor and insults, by all means, enjoy
If you want something a little smarter but on the same lines, see <i>Boomerang</i>
If you want a solid what-goes-around romantic comedy, go for <i>The Tao Of Steve</i>
But anyone who thinks <i>Whipped</i> is witty and an accurate portrayal dating, well, I cannot agree at all
I go to UCSB and take some classes with the executive producer, Alison Anders
She's a superb teacher and director so anything she put her name on, I thought must be pretty good
This film as a selection at the Santa Barbara film festival seemed like a good choice
<br /><br />While this movie included some nice shots and cinematography, the lack of story and coherence really took away from anything the it was attempting to accomplish
My main problem was that this was someone's first film and you could obviously tell
Bad acting and an even worse screenplay stopped this film from getting off the ground
The soundtrack had some nice music that gave a sense of the main characters struggle to cope with the sadness that lead to his leaving and now returning the place he grew up
I just have to say that despite some of the better craft of the film, it's lack of story and performance really prevented it from being some good
When you wish for the dragon to eat every cast member, you know you're in for a bad ride
<br /><br />I went in with very, very low expectations, having read some of the other comments, and was not let down
Unlike some other cheap and failed movies, however, this one doesn't really remain hilariously (and unintentionally) funny throughout
<br /><br />-SPOILERS FOLLOW-<br /><br />First of all, plot it very inconsistent
Looking past the "small" mistakes, such as the dragon growing up in 3 hours, the whole idea it's based on is messed up
See, the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites which really were dragon eggs
After explaining this, they show some peasant poking at one with his pitchfork and the dragon pops out
Later, the obligatory "crazy scientist" guy babbles on about how dragons outlived the dinosaurs
So apparently humans were around when dinosaurs were, or we just have a fine little plot hole here
The other major thing is that the lab is blown up with a force "half as strong" as what was used for Hiroshima
Then two guys later walk in to check everything out, and it's almost unscathed! There's even another dragon, which grew out of who knows what
As soon as the guy mentioned cloning, I guessed they'd clone a dragon
Smarty-pants security guy isn't so intuitive and smart as the movie would have you believe, if you ignore that I knew this film would be about, you know, dragons
<br /><br />Putting that aside, the second worst thing is the "special effects
" Others have mentioned the fake rocks falling during the beginning, the CG helicopter, and the dragon
It looks a bit better than a blob, but it ruined whatever it had going for it when it trudged down the hall in the same manner time after time
To their credit, the flying dragons in the beginning looked OK from far away (although the one in the cave is probably the worst one in the whole movie
) These things are funny to watch, however
The scenes where a million different shots of the same person facing different ways are shown are not
Nor are the "introduction" screens with the vital stats
<br /><br />Coming to the actors, they weren't the greatest, but I guess at least they tried? They seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors participating in the recent "BloodRayne," for example, and you've got to give them points for that
One thing I noticed though was that the woman who plays Meredith often had her face covered in make-up that was many tones lighter than the rest of her
She looked like she had a bad run-in with some white-face
You don't really notice the music, but it's actually not too bad for the most part
<br /><br />The bottom line is don't watch it unless you want to see it because you hear it's bad (like I did), although the only funny things are the bad CG effects
Other than that, don't waste your time and money
Now please don't start calling me names like, "unpatriotic" , "weirdo" and more
<br /><br />The very length of this movie (4 hours
Dutta fell in love with his project too much
Even Lagaan was 4 hours long - but it was entertaining and gave a message as well
<br /><br />It's based on true incidents and real people
Kudos to it , but were the repetitive war scenes really needed ? On top of it the focus constantly shifted from one battalion / squadron to another and it was impossible to keep a track of them all
<br /><br />Between the skirmishes , there were songs about loneliness , lovesickness and related stuff
In the beginning it gave some relief from the violence but became so monotonous later that one could even correctly predict nature of the forthcoming talk
<br /><br />Why were the soldiers walking around as if they were lions in jungle , fully unaware that enemy was lurking somewhere near? And when they were shot , it elicited sympathy but it seemed unmindful of them to be so cocksure of their safety in the first place
<br /><br />Music was melodious and the lyrics were soulful but did not fit with the movie
Better to listen to them on the soundtrack rather than in the movie
<br /><br />Acting was the saving grace : From seasoned veterans like Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan , to relative newbies like Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna , everyone acted like a pro
Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve a special mention for lightening up the mood whenever necessary
<br /><br />Dialogues ranged from brilliant ("From Madhuri
with Love!!") to illogical / monotonous ("Pakistan se zyada musalman Hindusthan mein hain")
And the expletive spree consisting of all the MCs , BCs , Cs and F-words wasn't really required
<br /><br />LOC Kargil attempts to provide a fitting tribute to the brave Indian soldiers , but tries too hard and ultimately fails
Indian soldiers surely deserve a better tribute
Pitiful acting, awful dialog, ugly native girls
this movie sinks into oblivion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director must have been a weekend bender
is totally lost and has not got a clue on what is going on
No acting talent at all, very stupid reasoning, and just down right dumbbells
The so called security force around this park belongs in toy land: with stupid looking guns, walkie talkies that are useless; and a computer system that ranks with a roll of toilet paper
if the park is under construction and nothing works; why bother inviting potential clients until everything is complete
the writers should be the first victims of the mess along with the producers and the crew
The whole film belongs in a septic tank shot to another planet for viewing
Convicts should have to watch this, so they can commit suicide
The movie was TERRIBLE!!! Easily the worst movie I have seen in the past few years
One of those movies I will be able to tell people for the next three years that it was the worst movie I can think of
Thank you for giving me an answer to that burning question "What is the worst movie you have seen?" Answer: Celestine Prophecy
I read the book, enjoyed the message and was excited to see the movie, but then, they treated the audience like we are r*tarded
There is no story and the story that is there is crippled by too much magic and coincidence
It is too bad they have to spell out the nine prophecies and can't simply weave them into a story that is entertaining to follow
They didn't spend any time on character development and it was easy to not care if any character died
It was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stuck around until the end of this incredibly boring movie
The book is pretty boring too but I enjoyed the parallels that could be seen in everyday life while you read the book
The film does not offer the same opportunity and I would suggest not seeing it if you want to continue to hold the words of the book close to your heart
Need a lesson in pure, abject failure?? Look no further than "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom", an abysmal, dirt-poor, disgrace of a flick
As we all know, decent moovies tend to sprout horrible, horrible offspring: "Halloween" begat many, many bad 80's slasher flicks; "Mad Max" begat many, many bad 80's "futuristic wasteland fantasy" flicks; and "Conan the Barbarian" begat a whole slew of terrible, horrible, incredibly bad 80's sword-and-sorcery flicks
"Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" scrapes the bottom of that 80's barrel, in a way that's truly insulting to barrels
A young runt named Simon recaptured his "good kingdom" from an evil sorcerer with the help of a mangy rug, a garden gnome, a topless bimbo mermaid, and a tired-looking, pudgy Bo Svenson
Svenson("North Dallas Forty", "Inglorious Bastards", "Delta Force"), a long-time b-moovie muscleman, looks barely able to swing his aluminum foil sword
However, he manages to defeat the forces of evil, which consist of the evil sorcerer, "Shurka", and his army of badly costumed monsters, giants, and midgets
At one point, a paper mache bat on a string attacks, but is eaten by a 1/2 hidden sock puppet, pitifully presented as some sort of dragon
The beginning of the film consists of what can only politely be described as bits of scenes scooped up from the cutting-room floor of udder bad moovies, stitched together in the vain hope of setting the scene for the film, and over-earnestly narrated by some guy who never appears again
Words cannot properly convey the jaw-dropping cheapness of this film; the producers probably spent moore moolah feeding Svenson's ever expanding gullet than on the cheesy fx of this flick
:=8P Director Hector Olivera("Barbarian Queen") presents this mish-mash in a hopelessly confused, confuddled, and cliched manner, destroying any possible hint of clear, linear storytelling
The acting is dreadful, the production levels below shoe-string, and the plot is one tired cliche after another paraded before our weary eyes
That they actually made a sequel(!!!) makes the MooCow's brain whirl
James Horner's("Braveheart", "Titanic","The Rock") cheesy moosic from "Battle Beyond the Stars" was lifted, screaming and kicking, and mercilessly grafted onto this turkey - bet this one doesn't pop up on his resume
The MooCow says as a cheapo rent when there is NOTHING else to watch, well, it's moore fun than watching dust bunnies mate
There have been some funny movies about spirits to come out of Hollywood
Cary Grant was an angel in "The Bishop's Wife" (1947)
Of course the best were the Topper movies in the late '30s-early '40s
And, more recently, Warren Beatty's "Heaven Can Wait" (1978), which was a remake of 1941's "Here Comes Mr
" These were well-written, funny, entertaining comedies, all of which centered around supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels
<br /><br />Now comes writer-director Jeff Lowell, making his feature film debut with a story of an unlikable, bitchy young woman, Kate (Eva Longoria Parker), who gets killed on her wedding day and then comes back to harass the fledgling spiritualist, Ashley (Lake Bell) who is falling for Kate's fiancé, Henry (Paul Rudd)
One thing that is clear at the outset: Longoria Parker is no Constance Bennett (Marion Kerby in the first two "Topper" films), who is the standard against whom all female ghosts are measured
<br /><br />There is a line right at the beginning when Henry's sister, Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) tells Henry, "You don't smile
" That aptly described my situation throughout this film
<br /><br />The main problem with the film is that the script just isn't very funny
But it's made worse by Longoria Parker's presence that just rubbed me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen
Just to start out with, compounding her lack of comedic talent, she is covered with so much pancake makeup, who knows what she really looks like? Kate gets killed while setting up for her wedding by a falling frozen statue
She's so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about what her afterlife is about walks out on her (well, she actually just fades out), so Kate finds herself back on earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission is
<br /><br />Chloe wants Henry to snap out of the funk into which he has naturally descended after Kate's death (from what I saw of Kate, he should have felt a wonderful relief), so she introduces him to Ashley, who really doesn't know what she's doing as a spiritualist (she is also a cateress to make ends meet), to see if she can get Henry back in touch with Kate
<br /><br />The vacuity of the film is epitomized by a "B" story revolving around Ashley's assistant, Dan (Jason Biggs)
This is thrown in near the end, but the way Ashley handles it indicates that she's as much of a boob as Kate
Since Dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely flawed women, he deserves whatever he gets
<br /><br />Eventually Kate appears to Ashley and the fun should begin
It doesn't, and more's the pity because in other hands this could have been pretty funny
McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Alan Mowbray, and Co
must be turning over in their graves to see this is what their brilliance in the first two "Topper" films has wrought
<br /><br />Get your brewskies out and enjoy this flawed action flick
Speakman's considerable kempo skill (nice spin kicks, decent with the sticks - poor couch!) is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad acting
The plot isn't half bad; just executed pretty poorly
But if you're seeing this movie for anything other than martial arts, you're missing the boat entirely
And for a movie that is supposed to take place in Koreatown, way way too few Korean actors (even extras)
This movie is one of the most wildly distorted portrayals of history
Horribly inaccurate, this movie does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous enslaved laborers that the sadistic Japanese killed and tortured to death
The bridge was to be built "over the bodies of the white man" as stated by the head Japanese engineer
It is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors committed by the Japanese captors is the source of a movie, where the bridge itself, isn't even close to accurate to the actual bridge
The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood
What of the survivors who are still alive today? They hate the movie and all that it is supposed to represent
Their friends were starved, tortured, and murdered by cruel sadists
Those that didn't die of dysantry, starvation, or disease are deeply hurt by the movie that makes such light of their dark times
I really wanted to like this movie - the location shots were mostly filmed in Pittsburgh and the trailer had some wonderful photography
But, even for a filmed cartoon, it was a really badly-made movie
The continuity and pacing were both simply awful
The best bits in the movie are under the ending credits, so it's (almost) worth sticking it out to the end (though, oddly, it does pick up a little over the last half hour or so)
<br /><br />When the best performance in a movie is by Andy Dick, you know there's got to be a problem
Except for acknowledging some nice cinematography, I can hardly say anything positive about this movie
The single real issue is the protagonist's dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life
Abundant "emotionally powerful" scenes do not go with this plot and, because of bad acting, they also fail to create the intended atmosphere
The director only manages to introduce Anthony's dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution
The characters do not seem to evolve, although it is difficult to speak of any characters
Beside him, actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to, they come off as self-indulging amateurs
I wonder what ruined the movie more: the superficial script, throwing away all the potential of the plot, or the bad acting, disturbing any appeal that might be left
I don't understand why making remakes has become the trend
Every remake I have ever seen is awful, and this is no exception
If any of you have seen the quote from Ben Jones, that it is a "sleazy" piece of trash, he is quite right
Why they would take a wonderful television show, which I loved, have never missed an episode, and own seasons 1-4 on DVD, and ruin it, I'll never know
The television show was a family show, and although Daisy has the body, it was really flaunted, or even addressed in the show, save the outfits
A family show has been turned in to a dirty piece of garbage, and I wouldn't recommend anyone go see it
Another thing I didn't like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors (along with the rest of the original cast), and they are also extremely cute
The new Bo and Luke are not even a little cute
They could have at least gotten a brunette for Daisy
I don't think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Boss Hogg, either
Every other role he has ever played is totally opposite this role
The only role they cast halfway decent is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but still it is no comparison
Denver Pyle is an actor all his own, and that made him perfect for the role
I think that the casting is awful, the story is awful, and all in all ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty, terrible movie
I only saw it out of curiosity, plus there was a free ticket in season 4 DVD
I would never have paid to see this movie, but it was free
I too like Dafoe as an actor but i wasted a few hours of my life actually watching this film, I still cant believe i managed to watch it in its entirety
Was there actually a point to the film?, and the ending, well, Im glad i never paid to see this awful pointless piece of pathetic excuse of a film!<br /><br />Im not sure without hunting the facts out but is Dafoe married or seeing the awful actress in this film in real life, if so was it an attempt to kick start her career?, if so im afraid it must have failed
<br /><br />I post this in the hope i can actually put someone off watching this film, even if 1 person takes heed of my comments and decides they would much rather watch paint drying i will feel i have made some good in the world, if only i had had the same advice
The Brothers Quay are directors, judging by conventional thought, should have stuck to making short films
I myself actually really liked their first feature, Institute Benjamenta, but judging by their sophomore effort, The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes, I'm willing to agree they don't come close to equaling their past genius at feature length
Piano Tuner is, without a doubt, a gorgeous film to look at, and often to listen to
Unfortunately, it's borderline painful to sit through with its convoluted narrative and glacial pace
Reading the plot synopsis, it sounds like a pretty good story
But the Brothers fail miserably to bring it to life
One thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future: dialogue
Amelia and Michael are a married couple that are cheating on each other
Amelia has a long-time lover in the hospital and Michael hires a prostitute that doesn't satisfy him
The two smolder with their infidelity but manage to connect to each other in the end
<br /><br />There's not a whole lot to this particular short
The direction is straight-forward and dramatic, which is good, the acting is sincere, but the story leaves a little bit to be desired
Why, exactly, do we care about these two people? It's a little hard to see how this story sticks out from any other infidelity story except that it's much more pared down and doesn't search for meaning in it (a welcoming change of pace if anything)
<br /><br />I don't know, it's possible I don't connect to these stories because I've never experienced them
But I have noticed that the blocking in these narratives are typically the same, i
, a couple talking together while avoiding eye-contact by pretending to be immersed in magazines, etc
The nice things about short films is that they provide a bit more room for trying something different, and I'd like to see a different take
The director tries to be Quentin Tarantino, the screenwriters try to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger tries to be Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn tries to be Orson Welles, Michael Rooker tries to be Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Faye Dunaway (older version), Cameron Diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as she can (successfully), don't ask about Joanna Going
Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff
It delivers endless, meaningless dialog and very little action
<br /><br />Tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies, an art deco church by Bruce Goff and a lovely, sprawling mansion by Frank Lloyd Wright
"The Bat People" is a really bad film that deserved the MST3K treatment just as well like that other film "The Creeping Terror
"<br /><br />In it, we are in some sort of mountainous terrain full of bats
We see many things happen, like bats flying out and attacking and stuff, station wagon chases, mishaps at the emergency room, and much more! All this, plus the cheesy mediocrity of the 1970s (hey, think "Mitchell" here!), making "The Bat People" actually one of the very best of the last "Mystery Science Theater 3000" episodes made in the series! Moviewise, it's awful
It should be avoided like the plague, unless Tom Servo and Crow are watching with you
<br /><br />"The Bat People" - more like "The Bad People!!!!!" LOL<br /><br />1/10 of course!!!!
Can't get girls, needs to build up, is picked on by stronger more successful guys, etc
I'd have to say that Rob needs to move past the Adam Sandler part of his life
There are two funny parts in the whole movie
I couldn't even finish the last 5 minutes
I do usually enjoy Adam Sandler films that have the same plot
This is not a film that most people could really get into
This film story is bad enough, which can happen in real life
I'm very can not understand when they show us this bad film
I say it was bad because there is some reason
if Madonna was rich and can do everything she want, then why she falling in love with that bad man
How can the story script is so weak? She was so rich, can do everything she want, but not dare to divorce her husband that is very impossible
<br /><br />The words I LOVE YOU, it doesn't meant anything in this film
From the stupid "quaint African natives" travelogue footage with our badly-superimposed principals acting as narrators, to the horrible fake ears which transform docile Indian elephants into African elephants, to the utter lack of any logic at all, to Maureen O'Sullivan's incessant whining of "Tarzan! Tarzan!", there is nothing about this movie which deserves classic status
This may be the worst show I've ever seen
Aside from the tastelessness of having a sitcom about Hitler, it just isn't funny or entertaining in any way
It is very similar to a 1950's sitcom in its cornball humor and contrived situations, but while it can be well done like in I Love Lucy, it's just not funny here
I think the show was based around the novelty "look, it's Hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure" but it just fell flat in every regard
The guy playing Hitler is so hammy that its hard to sit through that alone
I wonder what could have possibly made the network think this was a good idea to air
I thought America had some tasteless show, but the Brits had us beat this time
America would never air a sitcom about Hitler, although we did have that show about Lincoln's slave, The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer
Chances are you'll probably never see this show, since it only aired one episode and will probably never be released on DVD
I simply give this a three because it fulfilled what my buddies and I hoped it would do: entertain
<br /><br />I wasn't stupid enough to rent this thinking it would be a zombie film up there with the likes of Romero or Fulci, but what I rented it for was a laugh
<br /><br />If you are looking for a film for amusement, or a film to make you shake your head in embarrassment, go for it
This is perfect for junior- "Mystery Science Theater" fans, but the only downside is that it is so bad, it makes fun of itself
<br /><br />I, personally, think it is a shame to relate this to any other Hollywood title that we may know, because when a film sucks like this, it has its own genre
Oh, how we have a misfire here; a film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other things as it wastes your time with brain numbingly poor production values; character stereotypes of the worst and racist kind since D
Griffith referred to the Chinese character in Broken Blossoms as 'the yellow man'; characters so unimaginative and un-engaging that it's difficult to watch as well as a narrative that plods along at such a slow, stupid and pointless pace that you will question the very people who say they like this film
<br /><br />Prizzi's Honor is a film that ends up being an absolute post-modern disaster in every which way possible
The film is a messy and senseless disaster that has John Huston directing; Kathleen Turner and Jack Nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gaps as either dumb stereotypes or supporting characters that weep on a phone now and again or bicker with a main character
Prizzi's Honor is a film that falls into a genre of neo-noir, comedy, romance, action, gangster and overall crime  this twinned with its director and cast should be enough to propel it through some sort of a story; some sort of a sequence of good scenes; some sort of intelligence in the form of a screenplay or something else but no  what we get is a nasty and ugly film revolving around nothing at all
<br /><br />I'll give a couple of examples of how shoddy this horror show of a film actually is
Firstly, the film thinks it's a love story and it thinks this for about an hour of its time: of MY time
Charley Partanna (Nicholson) is an assassin who kills people for a family that he works for in New York and yet he resembles his character out of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest more than an international hit-man
He meets and falls in love with Irene Walker (Turner) who is another assassin and they hit it off but as the poor excuse for a plot plays out, it appears all is not right
I read that the plot for this film is: "A professional hit man and hit woman fall in love, only to discover that they have each been hired to kill the other
" Well, yes that's true but that actual revelation doesn't happen until about twenty minutes to the end! Nicholson plays Partanna like someone with an IQ of 60: he walks around; seemingly making observations and talking out loud about things he sees; he talks like he is either drunk or has a more serious problem from within and worse of all we never get the feeling he is an assassin  one really poorly shot assassination early on (that actually happens off screen) is not enough to suggest this guy is a hard-bodied, best of the best, international hit-man
<br /><br />So with a main character who is un-likable and un-realistic, we move to the script
The first hour and a half is just a cinematic dead zone with what ever there is to suggest traces of life merely poor conventions: Partanna slouches around on the phone or in person asking the same things over and over again: "Do I marry her?; Do I love her? What is love? What do I do?" and it gets so repetitive, it's not even able to act as good humour
This twinned with the way he always seemed to be on the phone to someone: a girl called Maerose Prizzi (Huston) played by director John's daughter; which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laughs as was the scene in which she tells her father about how she slept with Partanna and loved it  that got me thinking, was this supposed to be funny? Should I be laughing? The film felt like a smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of a wedding (alá The Godfather) and consequential scenes with a touch of noir as gangsters, police men and assassins were introduced into the film
But what we get is something very, very different
<br /><br />The second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot; right, the love and romance is dealt with  maybe the film will kick-start
I was so very wrong: with more characters continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in a monotone way, we have a kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of his office: this scene sums the film up
Everything is briefly planned and then executed in a heavy handed and dumb way that just makes it look cheesy
We do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music; perhaps they have to get through security to get to the elevators; maybe they have to be careful of civilians when they hide in their chosen places and when that random woman steps out of the elevator and the gunshot occurs  the scene isn't even edited correctly
Some suspense, some drama: "Do I shoot or don't I?"; maybe some slow motion as the character has to quick draw before it's too late  anything but how it was actually executed
Prizzi's Honor continues its monotonous and uninteresting decent into filmic oblivion as it nears its climax
It's a film where cameras reflect in windows; lights reflect in sides of cars and 'dead' chauffeurs blink when nudged
Prizzi's Honor is a jumbled and messy film that will try the patients of any film-goer and don't say it was a comedy because I didn't laugh with it  AT it is another matter
The film is repetitive, drawn out and colourless in its vision and scope for originality - there is no Honour here
This is just a butchering of a wonderful story by Edwin Torres
This movie doesn't follow the storyline in the book
And, there are so many inconsistencies with the original movie that you have to wonder if the screenwriter had even seen the first movie
<br /><br />Al Pacino (the original and still the best Carlito) gets out of prison at the start of the original one
Here, Carlito retires with his woman in paradise
<br /><br />What happened to Gail from Lorain, Ohio? In this installment, she isn't mentioned, and Carlito retires with and presumably will marry some other girl
<br /><br />Also, where is Kleinfeld? I think he was in the first book
Guzman plays a totally different character in this film
Now, he is Nacho Reyes, a killer from Cuba
I remember that Nacho Reyes had a much bigger role in the book
<br /><br />It's been a while since I read the book, but where did Sean Comb's character come from? Also, I think this movie really glosses over the racial tensions in Harlem that Torres was writing about
And, the mob doesn't get the treatment that they did in the book
But, magically the Pleasant Avenue bunch is around for the second movie
I was so excited and hyped up about watching this film when the promos first came out in November! It looked awesome and the songs! I was quite disappointed when I went to watch it! This is a film which weaves 6 couples together
It has a multi cast of 12 people! A huge amount of stars have worked on this film
I think the director, Nikhil Advani, has not managed the situation well and should not have had many people in this movie as this would of made it easier for him
Compared to Nikhil's directorial Debut 'Kal Ho Naa Ho' , 'Salaam-e-Ishq' falls quite behind
I think Nikhil should have a smaller star cast
I think the best factors of this film is the songs! The songs are excellent and I think that all of the songs are awesome, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy done an excellent job and have done an excellent jobs over the years
I think the ratings of this movie may go up because of the excellent songs! One thing I was disappointed with, is that the director should not have included nudity in this film which is done by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar
I found this extremely rude watching this with family! Although, some may find this nude as comedy, it is not something you would want to watch with parents! I think the best acting was performed by Salman and Priyanka Overall, I think its an alright movie
This is a mildly interesting late 80's gore fest featuring some nasty slugs with a taste for human blood
If you can get past the ridiculousness of the whole thing you might actually get some minor enjoyment out of this
The acting is awful and the plot is simply there to hold the movie together between gory slug attacks, but the movie isn't a complete waste of time
The special effects are actually quite good, and the gore is well done
It reminded me of the remake of the Blob, probably because of the sliminess of it all
All in all, you could certainly do worse with an hour and a half of your time, but I wouldn't suggest seeing this movie unless you've got a strong stomach and are into this sort of thing
I had never heard of this Adam Sandler movie until I saw it on the wall at Blockbuster
Being an Adam Sandler fan at the time, I rented it
HONESTLY I could only watch about 30 mins
Do whatever it takes to keep this out of the hands of the public
I honestly hope this movie goes OOP soon, and I hope it STAYS THAT WAY
Thanks to this film, I now can answer the question, "What is the worst movie you have ever seen?"<br /><br />I can't even think of a close second, and I've seen some really bad movies
<br /><br />Absolutely nothing works in this film
Name a single element of any horror film and this movie fails
Here's some typical dialogue:<br /><br />"Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve, is that you?" "Steve, I'm not kidding" "Steve, this isn't funny!" "Steve, are you there?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve?"<br /><br />"ARggh!!!! Ahhhhhh!!!! Nooooooo!
I guess I was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor, so I gave it a chance, from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers)
Basically Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is set up by the police, especially Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family's names
That's really all I can say about the story, as I wasn't paying the fullest attention to be honest
Also starring Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott
Ledger makes a pretty good performance, for what it's worth, and the film does have it's eye-catching moments, particularly with a gun battle towards the end, but I can't say I enjoyed it as I didn't look at it all
This is one of the worst films I have *ever* seen! It is bad, even at TV Movie level standards
The plot is diabolically flawed, and the known names in this film are wasted on confused, uncertain characters
I don't know how the director managed to keep this excuse of a film together - it is that bad
Billed as a 'Psychological Horror Thriller' - it is certainly Horrific
And it could do you Psychological damage! The initial opening scenes held such promise - a possible embarkation on whether the soul is just an aspect of the brain, but the utter shambles that followed the car-crash scene is beyond belief
No matter how hard you try, you couldn't care less about the characters
There are so many sprinkled ideas that the film is at best a collage of disconnected phrases from Chinese philosophers, and at worst the film would actually make you go Brain Dead!<br /><br />I have purchased over 300 films on DVD, and this is the FIRST one I'm going to get my money back on
You could say that the actors will make a movie, but this clearly proves that statement wrong
Most of the characters in this film lack anything to hold on to
They play the part of cardboard cut outs being moved about in predictable and uninteresting ways
It could be summed up in a few words, but I'll hold back in case anyone reading does want to see this film
<br /><br />I had to fast forward the parts where Jack showed us how to be an obnoxious eater
I'd have to say that 70% of this film revolved around cooking, eating, or getting ready to eat
Quite frankly, I'd rather not spend my time watching Jack chew noisily with an open mouth
Personally, I could have done without the footwear references and jokes that pepper the first half of the film too
<br /><br />Outside of my own personal dementia, the film really lacked anything worth it's time
There were countless scenes and camera shots that felt like it was dragging
When something happens, the reactions of the characters are vague and dry
Oh, man! This thing scared the heck out of me when I first watched it
and I was SIXTEEN!!!<br /><br />That creepy animated Barbie is scary as hell! I want to stop talking about her now
I missed the beginning of this film, which might account for why I disliked it so much
On the other hand I've studied the fall of the Roman republic for years so I know the story
Then again, that might also be the reason why I disliked this film
<br /><br />The film has more historical inaccuracies than extras
Though it's so inaccurate that I don't think they made an attempt for it to be correct, in which case it can be forgiven
The odd thing is that they sometimes go to great lengths to be historically accurate that it ends up getting confusing
Like throwing in Antonius' marriage to Octavia, and then pushing it aside two scenes later
Why even bring it up if it serves no purpose for the plot and Octavia is never even seen? And like calling Antonius by his actual name (Marcus Antonius) in some scenes, and by his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes
<br /><br />Though historical inaccuracies aside, the film could still have been an entertaining watch if it wasn't for the leading lady
She's hysterical, dramatical, and completely lacking control of herself
Instead of being a clever and composed queen Cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad case of PMS
95% of that comes from the poor acting, but 5% is also from poor script writing
Far too many stupid dramatic scenes are written into the script
Sometimes you weren't watching Antonius and Cleopatra, you were watching immature versions of Dawson and Joey from "Dawson's Creek"
<br /><br />If you want to watch something about this period, watch
TV version of "Twister" springs a few leaks but manages to remain watchable
My sister bought this at a Wal-Mart a few years back when it was released, I saw it back then and thought it was okay
Later "Twister" with Bill Pullman and Helen Hunt comes out (or was it before? I think it was '97) and did a better job overall
But "Twister" was more silly fun; this is realistic with a message
It all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters: Twisters, or a low-budget character study?<br /><br />John Schneider and Devon Sawa (he's the reason my sister bought it) star, and Devon Sawa, who went on to "Wild America," "Final Destination" and "Slackers" got his big break here
So in a way, I was one of the first people to see him really take off
I don't know if it's an honor or a shame, I haven't seen how he acts in recent films
<br /><br />"Night of the Twisters" all depends on personal taste, like I said, it all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters: Twisters, or a low-budget character study
Watched on Hulu (far too many commercials!) so it broke the pacing but even still, it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties
Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis where both parts are played by Jerry Lewis
If I were Indian, I'd protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all women as shrews
They cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them I usually enjoy Indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment, especially for a modern Indian film
The story doesn't take place in India (the uncle keeps referring to when Mac will return to India) but I can't find out where it is supposed to be happening
They're dark, bitter creatures with nothing better to do than to spread their own misery
Through their charms (namely a sharp tongue and a fat wallet, respectively) they seduce desperate souls, who they proceed to torment and victimize
That's more or less the basis of this black comedy, as I understand it
<br /><br />It's not a blend of black humor that I can easily subscribe to, partly because it bothers me to imagine the audience rooting for the sleazy, main character
I did enjoy, however, the sound and the melody of the rapid-fire (and supposedly very witty) remarks
I was very impressed by the cast's strong acting, particularly David Thelis's; only the character of Jeremy seemed too bi-dimensional
The photography and the music, both dramatic and somber, work very well together
<br /><br />What really turns me off about "Naked" (and the main reason I'd never recommend it to anyone) is the way it repeatedly seems to present misogyny as a valid way to vent one's angst
In other words, in a world that sucks so bad, what difference does it make if one inflicts some pain on girls, right? To suggest (as some have on this website) that Johnny is not so unkind a person because he's not as rough on girls as Jeremy, seems completely absurd to me
And they're particularly keen on hurting women every single time they get a chance
One could argue that Johnny eventually gets what he deserves, as if his bad karma suddenly swung straight back and bit him in the ass
But still, his and Jeremy's sadistic behavior are treated to a certain degree as a laughing matter
And I could be wrong, but I'm guessing that most people who absolutely love this movie also find that aspect of the film darkly comical
How did this become a blockbuster? Dear God I don't know where to start why this movie sucked too much
The movie was predictable & there was no originality
The only thing I can admire is the acting of some characters
The movie was too bright, they should have done something with the lighting, eg
The make up on certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 horror flick
This is 2006! People don't get scared by other people wearing heavy make up
Most of the horror scenes we're taken from other Hollywood or Asian horror movies
Total rip off! This is why I don't watch tagalog movies
The only reason why so many people "screamed" while watching this movie is because of conformity
How many times do we have to copy scenes from The Ring and improvise it that instead of the girl coming out of the TV, its now coming from the window next door? No matter how you put it, ITS STILL A RIP OFF
If you want a good horror movie, go watch the 50 best horror movie listed on this website
I am very surprised by the positive comments because there were four of us that saw this at one screening and we all walked out
We personally felt that it was painfully slow to watch and couldn't sit through the whole movie
In particular, those in the group who really wanted to like it because of their personal experiences with sexual orientation alienation in the school years depicted didn't like or identify with it at all
:(<br /><br />That said, it is great to see that this film really resonated with a lot of people here on the boards and with reviewers
That's the beauty of the subjective art form of film
The basic formula for the original series was; take someone, get the audience to like them, then put them into Mortal danger
This formula worked for the 32 episodes made between 1964-68
<br /><br />Now, we jump forward 40 years to 2004
We are introduced to Alan Tracy, a somewhat less-than-diligent college school kid, with his friend, Fermat, a young know-it-all
They are whisked off by Lady Penelope in her pink Ford Thunderbird to the island paradise where the Tracy Family live, for the school holidays
Almost immediately, they are left in the care of Kyrano and his daughter, Tin-Tin whilst the adults go to rescue John from Thunderbird 5 which has been damaged by a staged accident
This is all part of The Hood's scheme to take over Tracy Island so that he can steal the Thunderbird machines
<br /><br />To rob a bank!<br /><br />Yes
The plot IS as limp as that!<br /><br />The dialogue is banal, the acting more wooden than that of the (fibreglass) puppets, the effects, anything but special and Hans Zimmer's score? What little there was of Barry Gray's glorious theme shone through Zimmer's lackluster orchestration
The rest of the score was eminently forgettable
In fact, part of the score was broadcast the following week on the radio and didn't recognise it! I didn't even bother to stay to witness Busted's mediocre efforts with the end titles<br /><br />To be fair, Ron Cook worked quite well as Parker, he and Sophia Myles as Penelope seemed wasted
With the right material, they could have been show stoppers
The CGI work was what I would have called leading edge - 5 years ago
<br /><br />The Dynamics of the main craft were just wrong; The original series models at least moved as if they had mass<br /><br />Another sore point is that the whole production seemed to be one long set of product placements, from every vehicle being built by Ford to the entire content of the Tracy Freezer being produced by Ben & Jerry's
<br /><br />My son (9) enjoyed the film but this cross between Spy Kids and 'Clockstoppers', aimed squarely at his age group, added nothing to the Thunderbirds legend
When Star Trek hit the big screen in 1979 with 'The Motion Picture', a whole new lease of life was breathed into the franchise which then continued for another 20 years or so
With this film, Frakes has missed a golden opportunity to do the same with the Thunderbirds franchise
<br /><br />I predict that this film, like 'The Avengers' and 'the Saint' before it, will sink into obscurity within 6 months, leaving the original series to its 'classic' status
Scary, but mostly in the sense that will it be over before I turn 70
I saw this as a late night re-run in about 1976 and thought it would never end
Like crackers, it's better than nothing (but just)
<br /><br />Ray Milland is a little scary because he looks as if he's been stuffed by a taxidermist
Yvette Mimeux looks as if she's smoked up all the Beautiful Downtown Burbank Brown
<br /><br />It's a sort of Roy Rogers version of Rosemary's Baby
This is one turkey that should never have been made
If you have insomnia and it's 1:30 on Saturday morning and there's nothing on but replays of the 1972 Roller Derby Chamionship, then I guess it beats that
But God help you if this is your only choice for entertainment
I cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema
So after watching the trailer for "Water Lilies," I expected to like this film because I thought I'd stumbled on something unique: a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love - sort of a female version of "Beautiful Thing
" <br /><br />The main characters are young French women 15 years old
Marie is slender, reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way; Floriane is outgoing, athletic and beautiful; and Anne is loyal, pudgy and behaviorally immature
The erotic interrelationship between Marie and Floriane is always simmering in this movie, if not at the surface, then just below it
<br /><br />"Water Lilies," however, is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens; it is about sexual frustration, suffering, ennui, teens working at cross-purposes and - in at least two instances - joyless, mechanical sex
It also proves that screenwriters and film-makers mar their own creations when they become too manipulative
<br /><br />In the extra features on the "Lord of the Flies" DVD, director Peter Brook says, "French cynicism starts with the arousal of sex," meaning the French regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism
Part of the downfall of this film is film-maker Celine Sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicism
<br /><br />"Where is the joy?" I asked myself while watching this film
Yes, first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh, life-affirming way
These positive aspects are missing from this movie; there is no balance
<br /><br />Organically, this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love
But Sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film
First, what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude? I know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in European cinema, as evidenced by films like "The Slingshot; The Rascals; The Devil, Probably; The Little Thief; Murmur of the Heart; Friends; Beau Pere" and "Europa, Europa"; but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion - "See, audience, I can make a film where I show only the unattractive person nude
" Either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity would've been an honest way to go
<br /><br />There is a scene in a club where Floriane and Marie are dancing
What follows next is not just Floriane cynically manipulating Marie; it is film-maker Sciamma cynically manipulating her audience
<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when Floriane warns Marie she's about to request something that is "not normal
" Marie understandably asks, "Who cares about being normal?" Then Sciamma plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie, because Floriane's request is a phony, derivative and substitute question - not the authentic, heartfelt question the movie, Marie's character and the viewers who've invested their time deserve
<br /><br />Here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewer's nerves: 1) Since when do the French - of all people - take baths wearing bathing suits, and with a turtle to boot? 2) What teen - of any nationality - would chomp down on an apple core that's been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloved's mouth?<br /><br />The three main actresses are promising and, if they find better vehicles for their talents, may become excellent actors
Louise Blachere (Anne) is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles
Adele Haenel (Floriane) could become a leading lady, or a bombshell, or both
Pauline Acquart (Marie) possesses an intensity and magnetism which are unmistakable
In the future, she could play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress to a reluctant politician riding a meteoric rise in acclaim
<br /><br />All in all, "Water Lilies" was very disappointing
Will an honest film-maker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love! No - not necessarily for the sake of this middle-aged guy - but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with
And yes, to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema
I watched this movie after having so much of trouble in downloading it through rapidshare
<br /><br />Parinda was so hyped, that I was really looking forward to watch it
<br /><br />Parinda is one of those movies which fail to satisfy the standards set by other good Indian film-makers, despite having a great story
It was even more pathetic to know, that the story itself was not original, it was loosely based on the classic "On the Waterfront"
<br /><br />Anil Kapoor was irritating, especially when he comes from America
The direction lacked quality many a times, except a few in-between scenes
<br /><br />Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm 100% sure, they'll make a mind-blowing movie out of it
<br /><br />I'm not saying Parinda was bad
To review this movie, I without any doubt would have to quote that memorable scene in Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" (1994) when Jules and Vincent are talking about Mia Wallace and what she does for a living
Jules tells Vincent that the "Only thing she did worthwhile was pilot"
Vincent asks "What the hell is a pilot?" and Jules goes into a very well description of what a TV pilot is: "Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show
Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows
Some pilots get picked and become television programs
She starred in one of the ones that became nothing
" Now to stretch on what Jules was talking about, there are BILLIONS of television shows/pilots that were never aired because they simply were not
Probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is "W*A*L*T*E*R", a spin-off to "M*A*S*H" with Gary "Radar" Burghoff as the lead
Hmmm, would somebody really want to be watching Radar for a half-hour trying to solve crimes? Hence, the show was never picked up
What many people don't know (or what they thought they knew) is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air, for they are made strictly for the Television networks for them to decide
Some have made they're way past and got onto the air (The pilot for the animated series "American Dad" comes to mind, as the show's serial itself didn't begin until nearly four months later
However, there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air, and this here is why
<br /><br />"Black Bart", a supposed tie-in with the Mel Brooks comedy classic, "Blazing Saddles", is a stale and bland "sitcom" with little heart and no soul
"Saddles" was a controversial comedy, nevertheless, with it's racist humor and vulgar comedy, which comes to mind "what idiot decided this would make a great television show FOR PRIME TIME TV?!?" I say "supposed", because none of the memorable characters from the movie, aside from Bart, on in this mess of a TV show
Mel Brooks wasn't even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in a long line (In a related story, I recently found out about an unaired TV pilot for a series based on the movie "Clerks
<br /><br />Set somewhere around the same time as the movie (or at all), the story circles around the only Black sheriff in the wild west, named appropriately 'Black' Bart, who is this time played by future Academy Award winner Louis Gossett Jr
, obviously before his stint in "real" acting, whereas in this he is playing a "G-rated" Richard Pryor
Most of the other characters are carbon (if not, really bad) copies of the characters in the movie: Jim, The Waco Kid is replaced by a similar looking character named Reb Jordan, a former Confederate soldier who is quick with the gun
Lilian Von Schtupp is now Belle Buzzer, a more of a ripoff of the character being that she's a show dancer and a German with a Marlene Dietrich-type accent and personality
While that's pretty much the end in similarities, The lead "bad guy" in the story is Fern Malaga, played by Noble Willingham, who I assumed would've been Hedley Lamar if Warner Bros
secured the rights to the name (See trivia for "Blazing Saddles") and his son Curley
I dunno, Taggart I suppose? The story is a poor excuse for a sitcom, much less a pilot
Bart deals with the mayor's drunk son and he's out-of-control behavior which has caused the town to spin
Really, it's a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the "series" and doesn't focus on the variety and context that would make this an "alright" show
I can't really call it a sitcom (and even if I wanted to) and that's primarily the fact it was shot on the backlot at Warner Bros
Studios and later added a laugh track, so the show is set up almost exactly like "M*A*S*H" (complete with a bland and dull "laughing" that is identical to the series)
The acting is so-so, but there's one part that always make me laugh, and that's when the actor playing Reb Jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out a piece of dialogue
HA! The script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie (Surprisingly, they use the word "N***er" numerous amount of times through a 22-minute episode, rather touchy for it's time period and even for today) and it gets repetitive
<br /><br />If you ever get your hands on this unseen piece of sssss
surly interesting novelty item, watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilots (It's on the collector's edition of "Blazing Saddles", God knows why)
There, yourself get a first hand chance for the reason why many movie tie-in pilots never air
The Good:<br /><br />Effective color scheme
<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Horrible mixture of actors with all CGI actors mixes Fifth Element with Final Fantasy
The CGI actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago
A giant pyramid shows up and no one researches it, no one really even questions it? And there is no explanation as to why the god Horus was even cast out, nor was there any reason why he must do something as trivial as impregnate Jill?<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />Awful script
So many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that are not fully realized
The dialog was almost laughable at some points
Random characters and events that are not needed
Jill is supposed to be this mystery, but apparently she was just a mystery to the writer
In fact, there is not one character in the entire film who has any purpose, any goals (besides the obvious one of Horus), any motivation
There are no stakes - the key to screen writing
Horus will not become immortal, but, big deal, he is a bad guy
One cannot even decipher whether Horus or Jill is the main character
That is the problem: devoting half the movie to each character means the writer never fully explores one character, never brings one to fruition
They are cardboard cut-outs who walk around and talk and pretty much do nothing but explore the fine set pieces
I am still watching the movie as I write this
I cannot pay attention because it is boring
Even the action is not interesting because it is short-lived and sometimes unnecessary
<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Not worth a watch
Threadbare story, sub-par character development, corny CGI does not save the nice set production
I am watching this movie right now on WTN because that was the channel that the TV was turned to when I turned it on
It is a not very credible and fairly boring story about a minister's wife (Alexandra Paul) falling in lust with a young stud/drifter (with washboard abs) played by Corey Sevier
Corey whips his shirt off a lot and Alexandra swoons
I'm getting the feeling he's supposed to be up to no good, and that's why he's messing with skinny Alexandra Paul
It's not really important because as I said he takes his shirt off a lot and I just caught a glimpse of butt cleavage
There's a lot of sax on the soundtrack, which is just painful
Good Folks, I stumbled on this film on evening while I was grading papers
My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that no one has ever done the genre the honor it deserves
The Icelandic "Beowulf and Grendel" is the least offensive I have seen, and I did pay $3
This Sci-Fi version ranks with the Christopher Lambert version
<br /><br />What didn't I like? CGI for one
More importantly is the faithfulness to the storyline, not to mention the stilted acting
I am used to both with all the versions I have seen
The plot is standard, the acting quite horrible (supporting cast such as the nutty neighbor and the lawyer friend were better actors)
Kind of amusing if you have some time to waste and like seeing the conclusion to a dramatic plot
<br /><br />The headliner who plays "Kathy" was just fascinating because I couldn't decide if her deadpan, flat affect was the result of bad surgery or simply bad acting (I decided it was both)
This leaves the script to comment on, which was pretty awful
Pat remarks, idiotic decisions, and reckless stupidity on the part of every character in the movie
Maybe this is what was so riveting; I don't know
I just watched it to see how bad it could be
(Actually the dialog doesn't even qualify to be called "cliche'" - but it's almost completely inane
)<br /><br />All in all, very bad, cheaply made movie
The sets, the same scenes (a house, a building) were shown over and over with no artistry or actual tie-in to the action; more like props that were randomly dropped into the action in a bad play
A chase scene could have been shot by any juvenile in a warehouse or an old school: poorly shot, cheap props, minimal action
I missed this movie in the cinema but had some idea in the back of my head that it was worth a look, so when I saw it on the shelves in DVD I thought "time to watch it"
Big mistake!<br /><br />A long list of stars cannot save this turkey, surely one of the worst movies ever
An incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented
Perhaps it would have made more sense if I'd read Robbins' novel but unless the film is completely different to the novel, and with Robbins assisting in the screenplay I doubt it, the novel would have to be an excruciating read as well
<br /><br />I hope the actors were well paid as they looked embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and more lately DVD blanks, take for example Pat Morita
Even Thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times
<br /><br />Save yourself around 98 minutes of your life for something more worthwhile, like trimming your toenails or sorting out your sock drawer
Even when you see it in the "under $5" throw-away bin at your local store, resist the urge
This film is beautiful to look at, but is like watching really bad experimental theater
The plot (if there was one) doesn't make any sense
Lots of shots of half-dressed actors wrestling and looking deep into each other's eyes
Lots of arty shots through windows and with people out of frame
By the time you get to the threesome on the roof with the cat, you'll be ready to throw a bottle of KY at the screen
<br /><br />It is supposed to be about a father and son's relationship, but you will just be wishing the two of them would just f*$& each other and get it over with
If you have always wanted to see bad Russian gay porn without any money shots, your wish has been granted
It's like a bad 80s TV show got loose and tried to become a soft-core porn movie
The plots of each character had little relevance
The plot itself wasn't anything to speak of
In the end he shoots himself? It's not really clear, but somehow there's a volleyball game involved
And the main character (Randy) sleeps around a lot
The only reason my friends rented this movie was because Casper Van Dien was in it, and they ended up wanting to fast forward to the scenes with him in it, which were barely watchable at that
Thank god I didn't spend any money on it, but I want that hour of my life back
Satan's Little Helper is one of the better B Horror movies I have seen
The film hatches a new plot, something that's not so cliché in the Horror genre - something fresh
But there are also some ridiculous questions that come along with it
Questions you will be asking yourself throughout the movie
<br /><br />The film first caught my attention while I was cruising the Horror section in HMV
I was tired of all the so called "terrifiying" Hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different
The cover art for Satan's Little Helper immediately caught my attention
As you can see, the image draws you in - it's chilling! I knew it was a straight to DVD release - but I took a chance
I mean, I just seen "Boogey Man" the night before - so It couldn't get any worse! After I watched the movie, I was semi-satisfied
It was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend, so he could kill
In some sick deranged way, he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners - a duo of terror
It was a great idea to set the film on Halloween night
This way, no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid
They would simply think he was his guardian
But, this is also where the "plot holes" begin to surface
<br /><br />If your son came home with a "friend" he met trick or treating - that's fine
You wouldn't think anything of it - if he was 9!, or round about the same age as him
If however, he appeared with a strange man in a mask, you would be startled and protective of your child
You would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself
Now, we're supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers
In this case, the mum is completely fine with it
Huh? They never seem to think it's a tad odd that the "man" doesn't speak - at all
Gruanted they think it's the daughters boyfriend, but after 10 minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he's not saying a word
<br /><br />The film goes down hill from there
The thing that got me the most was, all the mum said was "Do you want some cider?"
I can't count how many times she says this in the movie
It's like, oh you're dying - we have cider though, it's all good!! The movie started promising, and failed to deliver
It was more of a horror/comedy, and even as that it fails to deliver
I guess you could call it a "Dud","Flop" etc
<br /><br />The best thing about the movie is the cover art
Though, something tells me that's not worth the 12 dollars
I cannot even imagine Gigli being worse that this
Previews made us say "NO", but then looking for something amid the dreck out there right now, we decided to go ahead and give it a shot
He's an image and can look good with explosions, but not even the kind Bruce Willis got in "Die Hard"
If he stripped his shirt and ran around fighting bad guys, it would be a comedy
<br /><br />The best part was Catherine O'Hara -- she's always good
Gandolfini flops again (if it weren't for The Sopranos, he'd be washed up) like he did in "The Mexican"
<br /><br />Affleck hogs every scene and as others have said -- no character has any motivation whatsoever for their actions
<br /><br />AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS
The plot sucked, the acting was bad, the editing was inept and this movie makes me want to poke my eyes out
I wish I had the time I spent watching this movie back
The balloon scene was stupid, the Mormon jokes are really old, the soundtrack sucked, I saw no chemistry between the two leads, it's full of stereotypes, stupid local "celeb" cameo's
most noted was Del "I'm going to drive as fast as I want to
What is worst is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side and even they screwed that up
This movie help create a long line of lackluster efforts to mainstream LDS beliefs into Hollywood
I would forgo watching this movie and instead run head first into a brick wall
You will be more entertained than watching this poor excuse for a show
It reminded me of the movie Resurrection (Christopher Lambert), which i also found extremely boring
And "Semana Santa" is in every way an even poorer movie
<br /><br />Only fine one in the cast doing something for this movie is Alida Valli
Alida is one of the grand old ladies in european movie history
I loved her maniacal looks in "Suspiria" and "inferno" (Dario Argento)
I will not spend more time dealing with this movie
I will say another good thing about this movie
use it if you want to fall asleep very quickly
Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is mildly amusing in this 1970 turkey, but the script is so lame and insulting that even Goldie Hawn's youth (just after her Oscar win) cannot begin to pull this one out of the mud
As a skirt-chasing celeb in his 40's, Sellers mostly embarrasses himself to the nth degree
Best performance = ? Nicky Henson plays a young study type
<br /><br />I hope Hawn and Sellers were paid well, because I see no other reason for tripe like this in 1970 (a very good year for films - CATCH-22, M
, HUSBANDS, JOE, WUSA, FIVE EASY PIECES and many others)
The story line has been rehashed a number of times; "a breath of life in the retirement home"
Several plays, movies, novels, short stories, poems and news articles have beat the subject to no end, but it's still an excellent platform for character studies
<br /><br />If 'Gideon' was crafted more enthusiastically it could be brilliant, but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely flooded with cliches (even the subtitle and summary of Gideon's "simple wisdom" almost made me laugh in its ineffectiveness)
Mostly indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film, but the rest of it is bland enough to make the actors' lack of focus almost irrelevant
As an ordinary movie-watcher I can't say I enjoyed watching this one
It's not too emotional for a drama, not too gripping for a thriller, not too fast for an action
Plus, some moments of the movie are hardly credible
OK, I understand, soldiers become a bit out of their mind out there, but it's hard to believe that a person would risk his life, carjack into the middle of a hostile city, and after being shouted at by a professor's wife run away, without having asked a question (in a proper way)
It would seem terribly romantic if it were an animation or so, but it's supposed to be a SERIOUS film about war
There are several episodes like this, so the whole picture makes an impression that it's just a raw preview of a movie, and it needs considerable work
<br /><br />It feels like the movie makers wanted to create an image of an emotional brave soldier, but all these 'curves' of his psychology seem simply unnatural
<br /><br />This picture left a question in my head: WHY? Why they gave it an Oscar? Why SIX? And IMHO it's the most thrilling part of the movie :
When I am watching a film, I am aware that it is `just a movie,' but nonetheless I do like to allow myself to become engrossed as much as possible under the circumstances
I think this is what makes us cry, scream, laugh, or otherwise react emotionally as audience members, even though, deep down, we know it is `just a movie
' What I don't want is for the movie to remind me it is just a movie so that I am unable to slip into the aforementioned engrossment regardless of the quality of the film
This film's director chose to frequently use multi-angle camera shots simultaneously on the screen
Maybe it is just me, but I find this to be terribly distracting and downright irritating
They might as well run a continuous banner across the bottom of the screen reading, `Attention: This is just a movie
Do not allow yourself to become too interested or engrossed'
If I want `picture-in-picture', I'll activate it from my TV remote, but never during a movie I want to enjoy
I think if you are into the sixties kind of thing, as I am, you are obligated to waste about 80 minutes of your life watching this barely watchable trainwreck
The saving graces of this oddity include a surprisingly apt social commentary on sixties values along with a number of relatively well known actors caught in early (and embarrassing) footage
It's as if the producers of Laugh-In sat down and decided to write a full length film, covering all the high points (and more) of the issues between the flower children and the establishment, then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a $10,000 budget to complete it
Hardly a classic, but in its own way it does capture how truly strange that time was, the silliness, the over-idealism, and the uptightness of the establishment
This star-studded British/Spanish co-production looks great, what you can see of it
I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and all are terribly cropped, so badly that it looks as if buildings are having conversations with each other
Few films suffer as badly from pan and scan as this one, as director Robert Parrish seems to have been so enamored with the widescreen process that he tended to use both sides of the screen at once, neglecting the middle
Another user comments that we see the entire inhabitants of a church massacred at the beginning; not in any of the copies I have
There are some abrupt cuts of peasants firing their rifles, one Mexican officer is shot, Shaw and Landau celebrating, and that's it
We never find out why Shaw has become a priest (if he really is), we never find out what happens to Don Carlos (Savalas) although I suspect he was called home to star in Kojak, as his departure seems arbitrary
And there is a strange flashback sequence where Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) is dancing around in a bowler hat and bad suit in the great old English music hall tradition to the 1960 hit BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, not sung by Johnny Horton here but with some lyrics I've never heard before
On the plus side, the location is great, a huge old ruined fortress with Escher-style stairs leading nowhere, some nice scenery-chewing by Robert Shaw, and good performances by Stevens, Landau, Lettieri, and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas
I didn't really like this film, but I haven't exactly seen it
I will seek the widescreen version and make my decision then
I've said this in other reviews, without a story, you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want, still no one will give a damn
<br /><br />The director seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco (which I love), and I think the idea of using all digital backgrounds and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making
However, it's obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie, he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinned-plotted film
(SPOILER) For crying out loud, they forgot to have a villain in this thing! OK they have one, but he's been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place
Conran misses the point of HAVING a villain
As far as action goes, well let's see, Sky Captain (Law) shoots down ONE robot, two or three of the flapping wing airplanes (before Dex (Ribisi) tells him to stop shooting them down!!!), and a couple robots, but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him
Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie (the reviewer who comments on hers and Law's lack of chemistry is so right) and I for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera, showing she ONLY HAS TWO SHOTS LEFT, both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie, one uncomically, one quite funny, although I saw it coming from 70 years away
No one except Law and Paltrow have any significant time on screen, and that's the movie's real flaw
An audience doesn't identify with robots, they need a hero to root for, and a visible, despicable villain to hate
Without that, plus a good engaging story, all the CG in the world won't help
I have never seen a comedy that was this much of a chore to sit thru
Ok, maybe one little chuckle for the Michael Clarke Duncan bit as the big, black, bald gay virgin
But the rest of it was shockingly un-funny
On top of being void of any laughs the "skits" go on forever! Steer clear of this one if you value your time and money
<br /><br />1) Adam Arkin is more whiny than Ross Geller from 'Friends' <br /><br />2) A great cast is wasted (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) with this amateurish script
<br /><br />3) The movie suffers from horrible pacing
It jumps around through in a jumbled, confusing manner
<br /><br />4) The story doesn't even make sense
Why does he want to break the football streak? What about the stupid violin music? None of it is explained
It's like a bunch of accountants trying to do improv, saying "Lookit me! Lookit me I'm being funny!" This was a bad attempt at making another "Love At First Bite"
<br /><br />I like Larry Cohen movies, but man he failed here
This movie is not that interesting, except for the first ten minutes
The pace and editing are a perfect introduction in an ensemble piece, even better than say Gosford Park
Then it inexplicably slows down, loses focus and starts resembling a traditional French movie only to regain focus in the end with the love relation between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cécile (Deneuve)
In the middle there are too many sidelines and loose ends in the story, several threads started are not ended
<br /><br />*******SPOILERS AHEAD The main story is the relation between Antoine and Cécile
He has been loyal to her after his relation with her many years ago, despite her remarrying and setting up home in Morocco
As builder he now rebuilds his own life and recovers hers by taking the mask of Cécile's marriage
Having accomplished this, he is buried after a freak accident (literally) and becomes a comatose
He wakes only after she has burned their old picture as indication that they've reconciled with the past and can properly start their lives again together
*******END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />It remains unclear what vision this director wants us to see us because there are so many other stories here: Illegal immigrants want to enter Europe, there are frequent radio broadcasts about the overthrow of Iraq's former regime
Cécile's child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs (loyalty) once he meets his boyfriend, whereas the girl he lives with seems to be sick (of that?)
Her sister is traditional Islamic, and enters a relation with Cécile's husband
It portrays Morocco as unnecessary backward, despite all the building there is a strange colonial vision shining through that almost glorifies the past
It portrays Islam as backward and prone to extremism, which may sometimes be true, but certainly not in general
In the end it can all best be described as adding some couleur locale and l'art pour l'art
<br /><br />Deneuve and Depardieu are great
With this material they are so familiar they are able to spin something extra in every scene: lifting an eyebrow, body language, radiating pride, awkward behavior
The movie itself is disappointing and only confirming the limited role of French cinema in the world nowadays
I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon on USA
Considering this movie was made for TV is was interesting enough to watch the sequel
So, I tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed
I knew I wouldn't like the movie, but I was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of DV (digital video)
The movie would have been tolerable if it wasn't for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere
I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but there seemed to be no logical explanation
(WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAYBE A SPOILER!!!!) The open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous
I can only foresee Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing, but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning
I wonder if there is any sense of sense in this movie
You get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film
I wonder which audience group this movie is basically targeted to
<br /><br />Priety (a pros) plays a surrogate mom for a happy couple Salman/Rani who want a child but can't
I wonder how it would be if this drama was a real-life take-off from a real couple's life
<br /><br />Rani appears happy with another pretty lady in her house who has been brought in to make a child for her & Salman
She cares for Priety and tries pushing her husband Salman to Preity so they may have some romance
When will the audience get fed up of Salman's nakhras
<br /><br />Though a good past-time, this movie is unbearable
I have not yet decided whether this will replace Anaconda as "The Worst Film I Have Ever Seen"
<br /><br />Even if you ignore the dodgy accents, low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it
I only went to see it as I had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour film
<br /><br />The simple answer is - they didn't
Characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative
Even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches it's climax you don't care what happens to any of them
<br /><br />I can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from
But after my friends and I came out of the cinema I had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened
<br /><br />They even change the true meaning of the books title "Rancid Aluminium" by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title
<br /><br />A real mess of a film from start to finish
I have recently watched this movie twice, and I can't seem to understand why the h*ll the makers made this pile of crap
I mean, yes, It gives a great impression of Hitler's environment, and I mean the way they reproduced Austria in the late 1890's, WWI and the Inter-war period
What I can't understand is why they pictured Hitler as a 100% pure evil, mad, unreliable, mentally unstable freak
He was after all a very thoughtful, loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides, no doubt about that
But why in heaven's name portray him in this way? All of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario, leaving nothing but a very propaganda-like portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever
Yes, he threw Germany into the devastating 2nd World War
Yes, he was racist, and yes he was at times menially unstable especially at the end of the war
But again; why the hell did they plain LIE to the public? To warn us?<br /><br />I absolutely don't think this movie was a warning
The true danger of Hitler and the Nazi's was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness
The fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every German alive (not to mention Austrians and a LOT of other people) makes it a warning to modern civilization, NOT the fact Hitler was such a 'weirdo'
If it would have been like the makers make us believe - I would have been convinced that the German people were retarded
A man like the one in this movie would have never gotten anywhere near party leader - not to mention ReichsKanzler
It's getting worse, the series is on a serious down fall
The first two sequel were acceptable and from then on we have seen a buch of really, really terrible movies
Robert Englund gives another great performance as Freddy but the rest of the cast can't act
The story is Alice, having survived the previous installment of the Nightmare series, finds the deadly dreams of Freddy Krueger starting once again
This time, the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of Alice's unborn child
His intention is to be "born again" into the real world
The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice free her spirit in time to save her own son? Check out the first three, miss the next three then watch the last one
Somebody could probably make a great documentary about the Jerry Springer Show, but this fictionalized version merely succeeds in draining anything authentic and interesting out of the trash-TV phenomenon
There are dozens of famously bad movies (e
"Manos: The Hands of Fate") that show more creativity and spirit than this dreary, witless waste of film
<br /><br />Seriously, why not a documentary about the Jerry Springer Show, that would begin to answer some of the real questions like: Who are these people? What happens to their lives after they appear on this show? How did the mayor of Cincinatti find himself here?<br /><br />One good line: During an "orientation" session for guests: "People, I can't emphasize this enough: NO WEAPONS!
I've now written reviews for several of the MoH episodes, and this is among the worst
An interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll
If watching people things they never would in real life amuses you ("let's check out the basement!"), then this is your show
Except, it's not amusing or entertaining - it's just annoying
<br /><br />The extent of the virus is never, ever showed
I can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only, as the resulting situation is very, very frightening
But then things deteriorate as daughter lets OBVIOUSLY deranged dad into the home, and ultimately dies at his hands
The woman flees north, and runs into a few tens situations
Then, some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her (things that make you go HUH?)
These directors are mailing this tripe in
But to paraphrase the classic bad review of 'Mary Reilly,' Moby Dick is like a painting, only slower
<br /><br />This is because the philosophical grounds for a movie "production" are never to make a great film, rather it's to substitute the lack of a strong guiding idea (in this case for a books transference to film) with a list of hopelessly atomized, undynamic but dazzling conceits in an effort to trick viewers into thinking they've seen greatness
As viewers & critics are apt to fall for this, Oscars follow, feeding the whole dumb equation
<br /><br />I don't share in the pleasure all these reviewers found
Actors dutifully recite essays about Jonah, Moby Dick, the ocean, Moby Dick, Moby Dick
all things that can't respond, and not one of which is absorbing in the slightest
In narrative terms Moby Dick (as a movie) is little more than a foregone conclusion in search of an actual story
After half an hour I was muttering "Oh terrific
another 4 minute soliloquy!"<br /><br />In the failed effort to involve you, it's a pretty campy overacting showcase
(!)<br /><br />One knows one is looking at a great director when he makes the medium his own rather than trying to replicate the feel of someone else's paintings & palette, or reverently embalming a classic as Huston does here
Paintings and books are nice but they're a different mediums
A movie like this fails to grasp that an honestly enjoyable piece of crap (Village of the Damned) is better in most respects than an insufferable piece of culture
This is the Eat Your Vegetables school of film-making
<br /><br />One appreciates the work that must have been done to make the movie, but not the narrative
Only a few segments reflecting maritime research are interesting; the recording of shanties as a means of structuring work & various sea efforts; and the technology of whaling
And that doesn't call for a two-plus hour movie
First of all I must admit Batman: The animated series is the best batman series by far
I didn't realize that there was a season four
BTAS ends with season 3, and it should have stopped there
<br /><br />Why did they have to mess with a good thing
Catwoman and Poison ivy now have terrible grey faces
The Joker looks beyond scary, it seems that each time they revise his appearance he looks more and more creepier
He doesn't seem to have pupils anymore, and now he doesn't even look remotely human (although he is)
<br /><br />Bruce Wayne is voiced by Kevin Conroy who does the best batman
There is nothing that sets him apart because they both look the same, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes
<br /><br />Night Wing really needs a haircut, please! Alfred just has pupils from eyes, looks more like a character from the 80's
<br /><br />I have watched three episodes from Disc 1 in the series and I already find that this version is more violent and graphic (there is blood in every episode)
<br /><br />If you are a fan of Batman: The animated series, there is no batman season 4
They just included this series as season 4 for marketability
If they just released it as The New batman adventures I don't think as many people would have bought it
<br /><br />Save yourself the disappointment and stick to seasons 1-3
I wish I could give this movie a zero, or even lower, because sadly that's what it deserves
I honestly never walk out of a movie, but this one was so dreadfully awful that I couldn't stand another minute of it
Please,please, please- for the sake of mankind- skip this movie
If you want a hot lesbian movie that you can really delve into, this isn't it
<br /><br />It has unattractive, unappealing leads, choppy structure, ridiculous dialog, and it is absolutely unconvincing in every imaginable way
On an absolutely basic level, it fails to entertain
Everything about "Mango Kiss" is so stagey, it is WORSE than any student film I have seen
<br /><br />As if that weren't enough, the entire movie relies on constant (and I mean CONSTANT) voice over narration
The script writer may as well have written a novel, because they insisted on TELLING everything, instead of SHOWING it
We are just supposed to assume that Lou and Sassafras are the best of friends and have a special connection, even though there is no character development to illustrate this
Also, this film continues to introduce to new characters after the first five minutes, and not in a natural way, but in a freeze-frame of the characters with their name written over the screen
There is no introduction, no development of any of the characters
<br /><br />This is the most amateur movie I have ever seen
<br /><br />I am a gay woman, who watched this film with my roommate (another gay woman) and we both found this movie to be a depressing representation of queer cinema
I am beginning to think that lesbian and gay movies are a lot like Christian rock - it doesn't matter how atrocious it is, people will still flock to it, and champion it, no matter how poor the quality is
Please don't rent this!! Instead, let's encourage the production of QUALITY gay and lesbian movies by renting "But I'm a Cheerleader" or "Fire" or "Heavenly Creatures", instead of swallowing whatever mindless tripe they aim at the gay community (i
I think i watched this movie, but don't quote me, as i may have fallen asleep during watching it as it didn't exactly "grip my excitement and imagination
" At least i know i watched enough of it to know i won't be watching it again soon
It wouldn't even appeal to a six year old
It basically had NO worthwhile dramatic impact
Comedy? That was supposed to be comedy? Ya coulda fooled me-ee-ee
!<br /><br />Now, if the aliens had been insatiably carnivorous like in the movie "Critters", we could have had the human characters do something a little more profound than be overly smugly cutesy
like yelling and screaming and running for their lives so they wouldn't be eaten so the story could be something more exciting than watching paint dry
You can find something more interesting to do
Where to begin? Anachronism? High tech cross bow with a scope in about 500AD? Arrows with explosive charges in 500AD? A monster Grendel that looks like a robocop and obviously never interacts with any of the weapons fired or swung against him? The heart torn out of his victim's chest without any sense of contact? Possibly the blond who would fit in on a recent fashion show with her make-up and streaked hair? The ancient Danish court represented in Classical Greek style? The queen played by Marina Sirtis more savaged by her makeup artist than by madness? The effects are way too weak to carry this story
There are some stories that don't mind or even benefit from cheap effects, but this Grendel isn't one of them
<br /><br />What about characters who seem to jump about in their attitudes without motivation? A bravado idiot prince whose home has already been savaged more than once by the monster Grendel seems to have less respect for the danger he faces than Beowulf who was sent from afar from the land of the Geats to help the desperate Danes
In this it feels more like an old cowboy western than any kind of myth
<br /><br />Beowulf is an ancient tale from an era with almost no literary tradition and much of both its sentiment and its drama is obscure
I suspect that any modern telling which doesn't make an intelligent attempt to penetrate the obscurity must fail
I didn't love the recent "Beowulf and Grendel" which sees Grendel essentially as human and sees Hrothgar and his Danes as too arrogant and stupid to recognize Grendel's attacks as well-justified vengeance, but I had to respect its revisionist position that Hrothgar's Danes were a bunch of macho thugs who never grasped, even after it was all over, that they had brought this nightmare on themselves, and therefore, the original story of Beowulf, as it was written, was a misrepresentation of the real story
I think there's a more complex meaning to be understood than that, but this "Grendel's" terrible secret that Grendel's attacks are tied to previous human sacrifice doesn't really bring us closer to the shame experienced by Hrothgar and the Danes
<br /><br />This Beowulf has little to recommend it as traditional myth or as modern fantasy
I give it a 4: higher than it deserves, but always hopeful that a poor effort will draw attention by someone who is up to telling the story intelligently
In the meantime, Sci-Fi's movie-making seems to be following the NASA policy that it's better to build lots of probes that fail than a few that succeed
<br /><br />This movie (not a film -- clearly recorded on a cheap cam-corder) may be one of the greatest cinematic stink-bombs in history
Beware: the packaging advertises the flick as an erotic exploration of sex-addiction
The film is not an exploration of anything, and it is no more erotic than staring at one's own warts
The script is pointless and meandering, with all plot elements serving as segways between supposed sex scenes
However, even the sex scenes are lame lame lame
Except for the first, they are around three seconds long (then again, maybe my version was cut) and comically overwrought
<br /><br />If you are looking for a decent film, you don't want this
If you are looking for a titillating sex-flick, you don't want this
Whatever your life's goals, desires, or perspectives, you do not want to watch this movie
How they got Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski, and Ed Begly to act in this stink bomb is puzzling in the extreme
Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing
Oliver Stone's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so overdone it's laughable
While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10+ year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a horribly skewed picture of the war
In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon
For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is a disgrace
Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie
It's been nearly 30 years, and I STILL hate everyone involved in this movie
It remains the worst movie I've ever seen
<br /><br />Before seeing this, I never much minded Rivers, one way or the other
After seeing this movie, I have an allergic reaction when I accidentally see her on television
<br /><br />I got dragged to this - against my better judgment - by peer pressure
However, coming out of the theater, those friends swore an oath to never again overrule my choice of movie
Nearly thirty years later, we still carry around mental scars from this movie
<br /><br />On my deathbed, one of my regrets will be the time I wasted hoping that this movie might get better
<br /><br />If you are ever given a choice, you would prefer putting your own eyes out to sitting though this movie
<br /><br />I registered for IMDb comments just in the hope that perhaps I can warn others against viewing this movie
If I can save just one person from watching this, then my existence on this earth will have been justified
Having read some good reviews about this film I thought it was about time I go and see it
Basically this family is entrusted with a clue that leads to a whole big stash of ancient treasure, hidden by the Knights Templar during the War of Independence
Apparently it had to be kept out of the hands of the British at all costs
Firstly, why did said Knights move the treasure from Europe to America? How did Nic Cages character figure out that 'Charlotte' was in fact a ship? How do they figure out all the clues and riddles in about a minute? And how could two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best guarded bit of paper in the world? These are just some of the plot holes in this inane bit of Hollywood action gone wrong
Cage has been in some great action movies - 'Face-Off' and 'The Rock' - so why has he lowered himself to this? Is he getting too old?! His character is pretty annoying really - Somehow this 'ordinary' guy steals the Declaration of Independancd, outruns thieves with guns, escapes from the FBI and generally seems invincible
The whole film doesn't really make any sense and all in all it was quite a disappointment
THE RINGMASTER stars Jerry Springer as a TV talkshow host called Jerry , but it`s not THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW , his guests are trailer trash , but not the trailer trash you get on THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, they attack one another , but not like on
What is the point of making a movie about THE JERRY SPRINGER show and pretending it`s not THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW ? And on top of that this is a very boring fil
I have watched some pretty poor films in the past, but what the hell were they thinking of when they made this movie
Had the production crew turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of making it, because you sure have to be brain dead to find any enjoyment in it
<br /><br />I am a fan of most genres and enjoy "shoot 'em up" games, but merging the daft scenes from the game just made this ridiculous and unwatchable
<br /><br />As most have already said, there was hardly any script and the acting was weak
<br /><br />Anyone who rates this film above 4 has to be part of the production company or Sega, or else they have a very warped concept of entertainment
<br /><br />I must say, I was more annoyed with the video shop, who gave this a thumbs up, which led me to rent it
Thank god I had a second film to watch to restore some of my faith in movies
<br /><br />Comic book guy would be right if he said "Worst movie ever"
The characters were weak, the plot weaker
I figured this couldn't be too bad because it has Christoper Walken, oops
He must have done this because he was bored and needed the money
The characters were supposed to be Irish but noone had an Irish accent
I am desperately trying to find something nice about this, I can't except Walken did a fine job with a wooden character
Find something to read, or watch discovery, don't ever see this movie
While I watched this movie, I tried to figure out why they bothered making it
Though the main plot of the movie is potentially good, there are all sorts of unrelated/unnecessary subplots
The marketing people in Hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guys, perpetual double-crosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex
It's odd that we see more of them having sex than we did of the President and his mistress
The many plots and subplots make the film too broad and none of the characters are properly developed - I really didn't feel like I knew any character, except that everyone is corrupt and evil
The ending is totally incomplete - it left me more than just wanting what might have been, but what was supposed to be
In the end, there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do, except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double-cross
I'm surprised that so many established (and good) actors agreed to make such a hollow movie
This seemed like a movie made by college students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project
<br /><br />Don't waste your time unless you are in a film class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie
The same night that I watched this I also watched "Scary Movie 4," making for one messed up double feature
Unfortunately for these killer tomatoes they could not stand up to the laugh riot that is the Scary Movie franchise
While I fought boredom here watching jokes that were silly and stupid, brutally dated and brutally bad, the more recent parody had me laughing out loud
Director John De Bello uses the basic premise that some sort of growth hormone has gone terribly wrong and turned the tomatoes into killers
But his main objective here is to slap around the disaster movie genre that was so big back in the day
The script reeks of stoner humor, and perhaps if you take illegal substances with your movie nights this could be your cup of tea
I, sober, was stuck watching a grown man go under cover as a tomato
And that one joke, that is never funny, where the discrepancy between the Japanese speaking actor and the voice over is also here
They even had a Hitler joke that wasn't funny, and I thought all Hitler jokes were funny
<br /><br />The narrative of this film is so splintered (for no good reason) that it is nearly impossible to explain
Tomatoes kill people, the government tries to stop it, bad jokes are told
Their aim may have been correct as their targets include the media, consumerism, and paranoia (three things that still control our lives today)
Oddly enough the main selling point of this film, those gosh darn tomatoes, really don't make much of an appearance
And when they do, get this, they're played by real tomatoes
That washed up gimmick did nothing for me as I get very little out of watching a pack of tomatoes devour a body thanks to the magic of stop action camera tricks
There is also a fear of going for broke at work here that prevents this film from being truly funny
The gag of having somebody fall asleep in nearly every scene may please some audience members, but more than likely it will be seen as an invitation to join in the fun
<br /><br />I might also add that there does seem to be some old fashioned human egotism at work here
Man eats tomato and that's dinner, tomato eats man and that is a worldwide catastrophe
In the film the produce becomes evil because of genetic modification, but in the real world our produce (see: Taco Bell) becomes evil thanks to neglect
And like those evil doin' green onions this film's shelf life expired a long time ago
The last shot was really quite splendid, but it was nowhere near enough to save this moderate stink bomb
I'm pretty sure there is a good movie buried deep within this concept, but the script needed to be filtered through about a dozen rewrites to get there
And by "there" I mean to the level of "Scary Movie 4
'Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees of the Australian postal service, struggling to rebuild their damaged lives
Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over-schematically represented
What's most disappointing of all, however, is the portrayal is life in the office of the film's title: there's no mechanisation whatsoever, and it's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living
Granted, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s, if it ever truly existed
It's a shame, as the film's overall tone is poignant and wry, and there's some promise in the scenario: but few of the details convince
Overall, it feels the work of someone who hasn't actually experienced much of real life; a student film, with a concept and an outline, but sadly little else
Not that I tinkle myself with glee at the sight of realistic blood shed, but when I put a DVD in expecting a bloodbath, and what I get is one bloody scene (the eyeball) at the tail end of asinine fake slapping, and spinning in a desk chair, I end up thinking "well that's 43 minutes of my life gone forever
" I wouldn't considers this or Flower of Flesh and Blood "movies" so much as an exercise of will; to see if you can sit through them
Flower of Flesh and Blood had a few tough spots to watch
I put the DVD thinking "oh man, this is gonna be sick
" After watching them fake slap the girl about a thousand times, I was watching it in fast forward
<br /><br />Two kinds of people would be interested in this film
1) People who seek out F'd up films just to see how F'd up it really is, or 2) horror completest
I sought this and the other Guinea Pig films for the latter reason, but even if I fell into the category of the former, this film wouldn't float my boat
As a matter of fact, I could imagine this film increasing one's blood lust
as in "WOULD YOU JUST KILL THE B*TCH ALREADY!!" So in conclusion, the only reason to own this film is for collection purposes
If you want carnage that traditional horror doesn't provide, get Traces of Death
Sure, that sucks too, but at least you'll get the blood and guts you expect
<br /><br />The only reason I can see for anyone praising this crap is because they feel they're supposed to
No artistic merit that I can comprehend, no reason for it's notoriety, no nothing
The title refers to each audience member's immediate post-reaction after 68 minutes of mental torture
Trying too hard to be terrifying, lacking good dialogue even any fear for that matter really makes The Screaming Skull more like A Snoring Dull
Albeit, the mansion and property set in black and white does set a dark tone for the movie, but that's about it
The only scary thing about this flop is that people actually made money on this! Remember the coffin guarantee in the beginning? That may be the funniest thing I have ever witnessed on screen
Sad thing is that viewers probably hoped director Alex Nichol was forcibly placed in a coffin, nailed shut, and buried alive for his lame effort
Jenny placed in this unfortunate horrific situation never really draws any sympathy you would feel for a woman whose anxiety is blamed on a haunted, cranial receptacle
Also, her husband John comes off as a condescending wannabe smooth talker, but this doesn't work and he ends up proving how tough he is by slapping a helpless cripple around! Ah, Mickeythe days before you could get a restraining order against estate caretakers like him
This guy's approach is not very good or maybe too much airplane glue
Still, despite his strange persona, Mickey probably is the only good thing going for this movie providing a slight sense of entertainment and I can't get enough of a guy saying "It was Mary!" and rummaging through pots in a greenhouse
I passed this one on the shelf a few times, looking at the myriad of huge positive quotes (with tiny names) on the front and wondering if I was missing something
The other night it was on one of the movie channels, and I tuned in
<br /><br />I must admit that I only watched the first 30 minutes
Perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that
Given the slow, plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30, I seriously doubt it
<br /><br />The lead character starts the movie in classic "I don't know how to start my movie" style, with a long, tiresome monologue about how he doesn't want to get sued
Others have commented on the "San Franclisco" bit; ok, a small chuckle the first time he says it
Then he grinds it into the ground, smiling at the camera like it's the funniest thing ever written
In fact, I think the talking to the camera bit was the reason I instantly disliked the film
Don't assume familiarity with your audience
Familiarity is _earned_, much like respect
<br /><br />From there you basically have a fat whiny guy talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp
I didn't realize he's Jewish; it's a discredit to Jewish comedians to call this "Jewish humor"
Just because you're Jewish doesn't mean you have a knack for the comedy
A WASP, Spalding Gray, does a better job of self-analytical humor than this guy, so obviously it's not about ethnicity
<br /><br />If one of the bits I had seen had worked, I might have stuck around
But some schlub going on about how much he loves the names of the women he works with, then listing them for five long minutes, doesn't make a great movie
<br /><br />This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of "Office Space"
Don't let yourself become a victim of target marketing
<br /><br />I didn't see They Call Me Trinity, but this sequel is really unfunny at all
It has many gags that are supposed to make people laugh
I guess the filmmaker just don't have the talent to do it right
I just saw this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is in it), and I must say that I was not pleased
<br /><br />Of course, the computer graphics were amazing, but the story line needed a little touch-up
Also, I think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood, as well if it were rated PG-13
<br /><br />That would definitely attract more people to see it-->teens
What would also attract more teens (particularly teen girls), would be a large close up of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster! <br /><br />Even though the movie had it's down points, I still saw it and thought it was okay
Bad actors, terrible script, totally unbelievable ending - this film had it all
After seeing films like this, you wonder why the makers bothered at all
This film has absolutely nothing to say, all the methods used to create a scare have been used over and over again in previous horror films
I'm stunned that the reviewers @ IMDb gave this TV film as a high a rating as they did
It's an innocuous, sweet, uncomplicated cliché' of a film that had two big names from the past in it (both of whom did a decent job), but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels
I like a good romance as well as anyone, but as my wife and I were watching this--and before we saw the rating-we said, "There are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there's nothing in it to challenge their brains, their faith, their comfort level or their cultural preferences
It's possible to make a good film like that (and Away from Her is an example), but this was amateur hour
There are some quite good films rated much lower than this one
Truly, another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday films
PROM NIGHT (2008)<br /><br />directed by: Nelson McCormick<br /><br />starring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, and Dana Davis<br /><br />plot: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher (Jonathan Schaech) who has a bit of a crush on her
Now, she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends
Once there, they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn Donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt
<br /><br />pros: I got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves
<br /><br />An example:<br /><br />Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her (she doesn't seem that great) has escaped from prison
Their reason: They don't want to embarrass her in front of all her friends
LOL<br /><br />cons: Let me start off by saying I'm a huge slasher fan
Usually I can have fun with even the bad ones
TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG
I also enjoy POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004)
So the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated PG-13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie
<br /><br />First of all, I had a big problem with the story
I like slasher films that don't even have stories
This is about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills her entire family
A few years later, he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends
? Then there were subplots that I doubt anyone cared about
Claire (Jessica Stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend, she has cramps, and I couldn't care less
This should have been a Lifetime feature, not a remake of PROM NIGHT
this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes
I don't even care that it's not that gory, some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT) were not that gory but they still had effective murders
Here, we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen, a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds, and a closeup on a bad actor's face as he screams in agony
I'm sure that 10 year-old girls were terrified, but not me
There was Donna's unrealistically sensitive boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and I can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life, unless you are a gay male
Then we had Donna's annoying friends Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the token mean girl Chrissy (Brianne Davis)
If you thought the characters in DEATH PROOF were annoying, try watching this movie
And don't get me started on Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and the DJ (Jay Phillips) who gave me flashbacks to Usher's performance in SHE'S ALL THAT
<br /><br />Add to all that predictable plot turns, a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material, and you have quite a stinker
I read the comment of Chris_m_grant from United States
<br /><br />He wrote : " A Fantastic documentary of 1924
This early 20th century geography of today's Iraq was powerful
"<br /><br />I would like to thank Chris and people who are interested in Bakhtiari Nomads of Iran, the Zagros mountains and landscapes and have watched the movie Grass, A Nation's battle for life
These traditions you saw in the movie have endured for centuries and will go on as long as life endures
<br /><br />Chris, I am sorry to bother you but Bakhtiari region of Zardkuh is in Iran not in Irak as you mentioned in your comment
Iran and Irak are two different and distinct countries
Taking an Iranian for an Irankian is almost like taking an American for an Mexican
Typically terrible trash from director Fred Olen Ray about a female cyborg hunter(Teagan)commissioned by Warden Jan-Michael Vincent to find and execute escaped alien convict Ross Hagen who has charted course for earth
Soon Forest Ranger John Phillip Law will have to protect a group of obnoxiously hammy college kids headed by the grating Richard Wiley who ran over Hagen with his RV on a camping trip gone awry
Soon the cyborg will be blasting away with her arm laser burning one innocent alcoholic Doctor(Robert Quarry of Count Yorga-Vampire fame)proving that no one will stand in it's way of retrieving the hide of the convict, whose collar is a tracking device that weakens his body
Law finds an ally in Leo Gordon, an old Vietnam war vet with way too weapons stashed in his cabin
<br /><br />Perhaps intentionally made awful, this features what fans of "rancid cinema" yearn for
dreadful special effects, acting, and premise
At least, the film has PJ Soles for some eye candy
it can incinerate some houses yet when the Cyborg shoots at Law it barely leaves a mark on the location fired
I'm one of the millions of Columbo addicts all over the world and just watched this,the episode that started it all, on British Channel 5
It IS fascinating to think what sprung from this so-so movie and I can only marvel at whoever spotted the massive potential of "Columbo" and added all the little touches that make it such a marvellous & classic series
That said, this particular movie is not as good as the rest (except for the embarrassing final episode & the patronising British episode)
If Columbo had been made as per the original 'pilot' it certainly would NOT have gone on for very long, or be watched and loved world-wide
In this film Lt Columbo is smartly dressed, drives a normal car, has a partner, doesn't talk about his alleged relatives and comes across as quite aggressive
There's also none of the cat-and-mouse chemistry between Columbo and "the villain"
Watchable, but only for the novelty of seeing how Columbo started out
Firstly, I won't tell you WHY I rented this movie, as I'm still confused myself
<br /><br />Air Rage is much like any movie I've seen where a plane is hijacked
There is of course that one important person on the plane, and the hijacker looking for revenge
The sad thing is, some of the methods to stop the hijackers have already been used in other movies
Are we really becoming so unoriginal so quickly?<br /><br />Although it's Ice-T (who for some incomprehensible reason makes painful attempts at ACTING while he's not busy putting the "c" back in front of rap) who is glorified on the cover, the movie actually stars the less than amazing Kim Oja as a stewardess who is 'surprisingly' OVERLOOKED by the five hijackers, which naturally comes back to haunt them
As for the rest of the cast, the only person I managed to recognize was Steve Hytner, more commonly known as Kenny Bania from "Seinfeld"
<br /><br />I can't forget to leave out my favorite part of the movie, when a hijacker used about a POUND of PLASTIQUE to blow a lock off a door
<br /><br />The plot was unnaturally predictable
It got to the point where I could say something, which I felt would make a stupid comment, and it would be the next line in the movie
the only thing special about this movie is that I wasted the cost of electricity to run my TV and VCR for 100 minutes
<br /><br />And the title - the movie DID take place in the Air
But due to the less than stellar performances, the only Rage in the movie was that of the viewer
<br /><br />So, if you're in the mood to even pick apart a movie, just because it's bad
This has got to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen
I remember watching it years ago when it initially came out on video and for some strange reason I thought I enjoyed it
So, like an idiot, I ran out to purchase the DVD once it was released
what a tragic mistake! I won't even bother to go into the plot because it is so transparent that you can see right through it anyhow
I am a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis so I am accustomed to cheesy gore effects and bad acting but these people take this to a whole different level
It is almost as if they are intentionally trying to make the worst movie humanly possible
If they intended to make a film that was supposed to scare you or make you believe in any way, shape, or form that it is real then they failed
read the plot synopsis and you've seen it
<br /><br />A condescending remark at the start and a few nasty autopsy photos does not a good movie make
Once again I'm amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving a movie production and yet they don't have the pride to realise that what they have made is an utter pile of crap
<br /><br />I sat and tried to think of a redeeming feature so that I could at least balance my criticism but the only one I could think of was that the opening track by Pink was pretty good
I wonder if she has seen this?<br /><br />Watch this at your peril, the boredom may kill you
If you've read the original novel, as I did, you will probably hate this thing
<br /><br />The film version of _Absolute Beginners_ is a nightmarish conglomerate of 1980s anachronisms attempting to create a "period piece" set in the late 1950s and failing to re-create or even pay homage to that period -- the US monstrosity of _Dirty Dancing_ does similar to 1963, except that film proved financially successful despite having equally amateurish screen writing
In addition to suffering from "looking too 1980s", the characters have been changed, re-arranged, and downplayed to the point that the only characteristics they have in common with those of the novel are the slightest superficial looks and, of course, their names: Suze is transformed from the narrator's flighty ex-girlfriend and promiscuous negrophile who willingly plans to marry a closeted old queen for money (at her own admittance in the first few pages) into a hapless and naive "Eve"-archetype seduced by fame and glamour, exploited and somehow scammed into a sham marriage by her boss, who surprisingly wasn't given a Van Dyke and pointy hairstyle
She and the narrator, re-named "Colin" (after the book's author, Colin MacInnes) for the film, are also in a relationship
<br /><br />Big Jill's character, a lesbian seemingly butch yet "fop like" in her mid-20s who acts as pimp to a cadre of young and bubble-headed lesbians, and one of the narrator's closest friends, dispensing frank wisdom to the narrator, is reduced to a sort of "named extra" with only a few throw-away lines, and tonnes of comical outfits
<br /><br />The Fabulous Hoplite, a gay young man and another close friend of the narrator in the novel, is also reduced to the point of being pointless in the film, camped-up and all but ignored
<br /><br />The narrator's father in the novel is a sort of sad minor character but in the film, he's played to come off as optimistic and oddly spirited despite the squalid neighbourhood, and the disarray of his marriage to the narrator's mum seems, for all practical purposes, ignored
<br /><br />In its favour, the music (for what it is) is well-composed, and you have to give the production and writing crews credit for actually taking a line from the book ("
some days, they'll write musicals about the 1950s
") as their inspiration to write a musical, but in the world of bad camped-up musicals, this is among the most poorly executed in the bunch
Unlike _Shock Treatment_ or _Starstruck_ crucial plot elements are treated as afterthoughts
Unlike _The Apple_, there is a choppy and uneven flow between musical numbers and spoken dialogue
<br /><br />You really can't blame it's "too 1980s" feel on the fact that it was created in the 1980s
The film version of _Annie_ released in 1981, pays a wonderfully well-executed tribute to the look and feel of New York City in the 1930s, and _Napolean Dynamite_ manages to capture a gritty sort of look and feel of the 1980s despite being made on a low budget in 2003 (though it's not explicitly set in the 1980s, those who lived through the decade cannot deny that the film "feels very 1980s")
Obviously, it was _possible_ to make something good out of this, especially considering the iconic status that the source novel has in the UK, but it fails most apparently in the look and feel, and also in its treatment of the source material, which is downright disrespectful
<br /><br />Perhaps if you haven't read and have no intentions of reading the novel, you could enjoy this campy 1980s anachronism giving a shameful parody of late-1950s Soho London's modernist jazz set
I can definitely see what the writing team were attempting, but they definitely could have done better
With Boy George as a household name and mixed-race musicians and bands on the charts in 1986 UK, they definitely did _not_ need to bowdlerise the characters in the ways that they ended up doing
In fact, I'd go so far as saying that the writers wound up doing what both the book and film criticised harshly -- it ended up having a bunch of adults cranking out crap and treating its targeted teen-aged audience like two-bit idiots to make a quick buck off of
As I am not a blood and guts fan I found the gory scenes totally unnecessary (you spell it) and too real for my liking, if you're the type of person who gets their rocks off on beheadings on the internet or snuff movies I say go for it, it beggars belief what sort of person dreams this sick crap up though
<br /><br />Apart from that it had the potential to be a great movie, the music was top class too (through the movie and especially the end credits)
Some parts though were a bit unbelievable, like you've just been found by your girlfriend trust up awaiting torture and death and all you do is tell her about what had happened and how you got there, (why didn't he ask her if she happened to have any wipes or even some air freshner or a piece of gum while he was at it?), come on now, most would probably just scream "hurry up and untie me then lets get the f*** out of here QUICK!"
where were the flys, maggots etc, and when the girl accidentally came across the place surely the stench of rotten flesh would have sounded a few alarm bells! I would only recommend this movie to friends of Dennis Niellson and the like, I'm sure a video like this would make sickos like that have a very happy Christmas
Considering the potential this move had, the reality was disappointing
While it's always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie, even that couldn't turn this around
And the characters were not very interesting
I wanted to like this film, but it just never happened
Ben Stiller was hilarious in "There's Something about Mary"
Here it looks like he's just going thru the motions
If they have to lift plot points from "Friends", they should have known something was wrong
The toilet humor should have stayed in the closet :-)
<br /><br />Watch "50 First Dates" instead
When you put this DVD into your player and hit "play," you will experience a brief moment of silence and see a black screen as the laser is guided to the correct starting point in the center of the disc
Make sure you have some Tylenol or something (preferably PM's so you can fall asleep), because you're going to have a massive headache once this movie starts
<br /><br />Starring a bunch of big-breasted girls and with an opening that actually made me chuckle a bit, I thought I'd be in for a good time
Sure, the opening sequence was a WEE bit awkward and most of the jokes fell flat and it seemed like this was going to be a Scream ripoff (by the way, my sole chuckle was from Julie Strain's final comment in this scene)
the opening sequence had a terrible rock song
During this terrible rock song, I looked over the DVD Chapter titles and saw things that said "TOPLESS IN THE BACKYARD!" and "BETTER THAN SEX!"
I knew what the selling point of this movie was going to be
<br /><br />And that's the sad truth: The ONLY good thing about this movie is the attractive cast
Other than that, it's a sadly routine slasher film that throws in an "innovative" concept about murder clubs, which ends up being fake anyway
So, the whole movie then points in another direction to try to be confusing and this huge mystery, but it all just adds up to not being interesting at all and leaves you feeling like you don't care for any of the characters
I mean, when the main character of the movie is revealed to have murdered an innocent woman, can you really feel ANY sympathy towards her when she's in fear for her life? The Scream influence is prevalent throughout, with a ghost face killer and some really terrible jokes
We're also treated to scenes of the main character talking to her mom and dad (Lloyd Kaufman! The only other cool part of the movie!) about an abortion or something
This isn't a "so-bad-it's-good" movie, it's just BAD
<br /><br />Someone compared this to a Troma film, but
you know, most any film that comes from Full Moon (or its offshoot, as this film proves) is horrible
NOT horrible in a Troma sense -- I've seen many Troma films, and I can honestly say they all offer something, ANYTHING that you can walk away with and tell your friends about later
However, this film has pretty much nothing at all enjoyable about it
This is one of those movies in which people keep saying "That's a great idea!" about the worst ideas you've ever heard
This picture's funnier than any 3 dozen Seth Rogen projects
<br /><br />Gojira movies have been cannibalizing their own origin-stories since the 60s, but this one goes further
What can you say about a culture willing to rape its own sacred cultural icons for a quick buck? This travesty presents a WW2 suicide brigade on "the last of the Marshall Islands" presenting arms to a dinosaur who chased the US Marines away
Then the Japanese inexplicably decide not to fight to the last man, and instead abandon the territory annexed on their behalf by this giant lizard
They retreat to the mainland, where one of them becomes a business tycoon
<br /><br />Blonde men from the future, irritable over not yet curing male pattern baldness, come back in time in a sort of flying saucer to ask a failed writer and a celebrity psychic for their help in eliminating Godzilla before he destroys Japan
The "help" is questionable, as all these 1992 citizens do is go back to 1944 to watch some closed-circuit TV, but, hey, they shot the script
You would think that by the 90s the Japanese would know better than to trust people in spaceships
Fortunately for Nippon, the white guys - you can tell they're American because they say "nucyaler" - erred by bringing back in time the one Japanese girl left in the future
In a touching display of ancestor worship, she outs their duplicity after donning a flying suit made from ductwork taped to a Sailor Moon backpack
Turns out these time-traveling, fashion-disabled Caucasians are just jealous of Japan's impending economic imperialist takeover of the known world (in the 22d century Japan's going to buy Africa, which sounds more like a liability than an asset)
These blondes in padded chintz suits with nonfunctioning straps and redundant zippers want to replace Godzilla with King Ghidorah, who will destroy all of Japan except Tokyo
A strange choice, but Toho's been known to go out of its way not to have to build that Tokyo skyline set again
<br /><br />Sure enough, we are given the alternate spectacle of Fukuoka ("my garden city") and some other heretofore unscathed-by-rubber-monster metropolitan areas being laid waste by a flying gold metalflake 1/3 of a hydra
In a surprise revelation, we are informed that King Ghidorah was created from some hand puppets left too long in the microwave
Godzilla also does his share of demolition as the movie winds down
Wait - didn't the spaceship blondes already destroy Godzilla? Yeah, they killed him in the third reel
But nobody expected that the Japanese of 1992 had a secret submarine filled with nuclear missiles - "Ha ha, don't worry
We don't keep it in Japanese waters" - with which to jumpstart a new Godzilla from the bones of an old dinosaur
Only they don't have to, because a leaky old nuclear shipwreck has already made Godzilla whole again
Oh, and Godzilla finally gets to Tokyo, reuniting with his old army buddy in a heartwarming moment of tearful recognition
They look into each other's eyes, and Godzilla nods as if to say, "Gotta do it, man
<br /><br />I should also mention here that, in order to prevent Godzilla's revamped angry self from fulfilling his destiny and destroying Japan, the Japanese girl from the future goes BACK to the future to ask for help from - yes - a balding white man
Probably because he pities her as the sole Asian character from the 23d century, he agrees to build a Mecha-Ghidora and send it back to the 1990s, so that together, these two giant monsters can, uh, fulfill Godzilla's destiny and destroy Japan
In a wonderful nod to those notoriously self-willed whipping heads, the girl piloting Mecha-Ghidora has trouble controlling the joystick
<br /><br />This Godzilla suit design owes much to the Sumo - his thighs are flabby enough to double for Rush Limbaugh's, and his belly and chest are thick and ponderous
But there's more exploding masonry in this picture than in most of his adventures, which makes up for a lot
Also features a man with a passing resemblance to Robert Patrick playing a killer robot
Yes, in the future even the robots will have bald spots
Plus Megumi Odaka, reprising her role as Micki, the only Japanese girl ever born with ears larger than her Disney namesake and an acting style even bigger than that
It's not her fault: many Japanese directors seem to feel that a seventy-foot screen isn't quite large enough to display the emotion of a human face
I did some acting for Japanese television, and I can tell you, they push you to go for it
They apparently urge their writers in the same way
It just takes the D&D nerd stereotypes and amplifies them
All the main characters make less than 30k a year, they all live with their parents, they're all socially retarded, and they have no luck with women
The jokes are horrible and unimaginative, such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a KKK looking hood on (it was his wizard costume) and the other guy had on a John Rocker warm up (oh how funny, he's a nerd so he doesn't know about sports)
You may have to be a childish high-schooler to find any of this stuff funny
Poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch, but obviously extremely cheap to make
I feel sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo
I guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties way past their prime
Everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie! It shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie! My grandma could have done better than that! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (It's actually so bad that I'm not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark!) If the first episode of Les Visiteurs' was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues, this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one
The funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it
Clavier is over-acting his role even more than in the first part, Robin is trying to act like Lemercier (because she's replacing her) but that's grotesque'
Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Even if Muriel Robin can be funny by herself on stage, she is not in this movie because she's not acting as she used to act
I know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role (Lemercier obtained a César award for her role in the first movie) but she made a big mistake: instead of playing her role, she played Lemercier playing her role'! As for the story, it's just too much! Of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but Poiré and Clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode
The gags are repetitive, childish and déjà-vu
No, really, there's no more than 3 funny parts in this
The only good things might be the costumes and some special effects
So you have only 2 reasons to watch it: 1) if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie, 2) if you want to waste your time or if you really need a brainless moment'! 2/1
It's been close to ten years since I've seen either of the last two sequels to "Phantasm" - surely due to my still vivid remembrance of them not being very good
That being acknowledged to this day, I'm still a huge fan of the first two installments so I thought I'd go back and re-experience the 'final chapters'
Part three is definitely the worst of the series since it obviously takes itself less seriously and throws in a bunch of confusing stuff that doesn't make much sense
Again, kicking off right where the previous movie left us, Reggie saves Mike from the Tall Man who vows to come back for him later, but things aren't safe for long when they come across Jody who is inexplicably able to the take the form of a sphere
Apparently his soul is held prisoner by the Tall Man so Mike is then dragged into the sinister double-pronged Netherworld and Reg has to find him
Along the way, he meets up with a ten year-old kid and a nun-chuck wielding black chick named Rocky who assist him throughout his journey
<br /><br />There's really nothing memorable about "Phantasm III" other than how stupid and forcefully "humorous" it tries to be
Only one positive aspect that didn't even help the movie and that was the return of A
Michael Baldwin and Bill Thornbury who reprise their roles for the first time since the original 1978 classic
The problem is, they pretty much make cameo appearances
Reggie Banister is of course back in his starring role, but his bumbling, love-sick attitude makes his presence far too annoying to like
Angus Scrimm also just didn't seem entirely "into" his role
He talks too much here and is nowhere near as menacing and creepy in contrast with the "quirkiness" that the movie seemed to carelessly resort to
Most people's opinion on this flick seem pretty impassive and tend to think "it's still entertaining"
Maybe I'm just too much of a nit picker but I just couldn't get into this one
I remember disliking it when I was a kid and after re-watching it - I can safely say - nothing has changed
Don Coscarelli rocked the scene with his original low-budget, nightmarish, legendary film "Phantasm", which I still rank as my top favorite horror flick and his respectable sequel kept things moving and darkly surreal and GORY, but "Lord of the Dead" (stupid title) just looked too rushed and slapped together to me
The inclusion of the two new characters, Tim and Rocky (the only thing missing was Scrappy Doo!!), was a strong indication of Coscarelli running out of ideas and seeing how far he could ride the franchise
<br /><br />So, it's a "Phantasm" movie with very little gore, nudity, and quadruple-barrel shot guns
<br /><br />I have no idea why anyone felt that the Garland/Mason version needed to be redone, nor why Striesand would have been a first choice to star
<br /><br />For that matter, I have no idea why our people (Gay Americans) tend largely to regard Striesand as some kind of treasure
At least in my opinion, she had peaked professionally with with Funny Girl, and Bogdanovich's What's Up Doc
<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and rent the Judy classic, or even the original (a fine film in its own right), but please, Please, PLEASE skip this stinkpot
<br /><br />The movie "Slugs" is unique because the titular vermin are actually the good guys in this horrific tale of nature gone awry
You see, these poor slugs have been mutated through the pollution of evil humans and don't mean to do anything malicious, they're just slugs- slugs with sharp teeth who eat flesh and excrete poison, but slugs none the less
The real bad guys are the humans, who either actively try to destroy our beloved slugs, or overreact when they encounter them
<br /><br />For example, take the scene where the guy puts on the glove full of slugs
They were just hanging out in a comfortable work glove when out of nowhere this giant hand came at them, and they reacted instinctively, defending themselves and biting the guy
Now, instead of seeking medical attention for his slug bite, this guy runs around his greenhouse screaming like an idiot, spills some highly volatile chemicals, starts a fire, knocks a bookcase over on himself, and cuts off his own hand- then the fire and volatile chemicals mix and his house explodes
How can you blame that on the slugs?<br /><br />This movie paints a portrait of humans that is less than favorable
The characters in this movie include the dumb sheriff who hates everybody, the drunk hick who's mean to his dog, and the lumpy sidekick whose wife is at least forty-five years older than him
There's also a set of drunken teens<br /><br />that get attacked while copulating, and we have to see the skinny long-haired freaks' genitals
Meanwhile, there's a guy who looks like a demonic Leslie Neilson who yells "You don't have the authority to declare happy birthday!" for some reason
Finally, this parade of loathsomeness is rounded out by the guy from the MST3K classic "Pod People" whose face explodes after eating a slug-laces salad (another easily avoided fate blamed on the helpful, harmless slugs)
<br /><br />Humans are portrayed as greedy, stupid, racist, alcoholic, and, in one pointless scene, as would-be rapists
In the movie's climactic scene, the villainous humans try to burn the slugs who are cowering helplessly in the sewers, Well, since they're idiots, the humans succeed in BLOWING UP THE ENTIRE TOWN
They alone do more damage than the slugs ever did!<br /><br />If you hate humans, and I know I do, you'll appreciate "Slugs"
If you're a fan of bad cinema, you'll also appreciate this crapfest from the director of "Pieces" and "Pod People"
There's enough bad acting, silly dialog, illogical plot twists, lame special effects, pointless scenes, and poor dubbing to hold your attention
Mindy hitchhikes to Big Sur, shoplifts a loaf of "shepherd's bread," Mindy nearly gets gang-raped
Ah, the pleasures of Crown International drive-in features
You must remember that these films were never designed to be watched start to finish on DVD players
They were made as 90 minutes of ambiance so the teens of the 70s would have a soundtrack as they got it on in their Pintos and Citations
The lack of pacing and structure didn't matter to the original audience -- they probably only tuned in when the T & A on screen matched what they were up to, out in the parking lot
The film is really irritating when watched as a story
It's a lot more fun to talk about it than watch it
My favorite inanities: 1) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy
With no luggage or change of underwear, they spend 2 nights sharing a motel room with the teacher, just like in real life
2)After being abducted and nearly raped by depraved bikers, and after their innocent friend "Pan" is savagely beaten, Mindy and her girlfriend find an unattended motorcycle on the road
Mindy immediately brightens up and chirps, "I'm going' to Big Sur!!" But again, it's a lot more fun to talk/read about than sit through
Three very engaging actors giving decent performances
The problem is, who cares about the plot? John Holmes
Infamous for his well-endowments, a drug addict, and a guy who, despite contracting AIDS, continued to make adult films, just does not make an intriguing character
<br /><br />The story surrounds the events leading up to and the aftermath of a vicious mass murder that occurred in the late 80's in Los Angelos to which Holmes was linked, arrested and charged with murder, and who ultimately was acquitted
, the guilt factor, regardless of the outcome, ranged quite high in the "He did it" zone
<br /><br />There is no one to sympathize with in this film, as everyone is a self-serving criminal
There is just nothing remotely interesting here
This was one of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting (mainly from the supporting characters)
The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the film itself
<br /><br />Hugh Laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the Samba but the scope of his character only required that he immerse himself at the kiddie end of the pool
The movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good entertainment
<br /><br />If you have never seen Rio, or the inside of a British bank, this film is for you
I wasn't really hoping for much when I went to see this
After Mst3king the heck out of JasonX with some friends though, I was hoping for a similar experience here
<br /><br />Unfortunately the movie took itself way too seriously
Do I care about Jason's problems? I'm sorry no
There are a legion Ft13th movies that cover that anyway
At at then end of the day, he's an undead serial killer, I'm just not going to get that sympathetic
<br /><br />Freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what not, but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie, it had degenerated into a bad episode of celebrity deathmatch
I've made it a habit to see as many as possible
Even the rip-offs they've done have been cool like EXORCISM And WHEN A KILLER CALLS
I can't believe that the same people who made DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA'S CURSE actually made this movie too!!! It's not even laughably bad like JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which, by the way are pretty bad)
This is just BAD! I mean, I can appreciate and/or forgive bad acting or lame special effects in an Asylum movie, but this film takes itself way too seriously
I really hope that SNAKES ON A TRAIN is better
Clint Eastwood is Bronco Billy, the leader of a Wild West troupe, one of six regular misfits who comprise a struggling-to-break-even touring show
The seventh member of the bunch is a woman, Billy's assistant, but such women never last long, and the position is chronically open
Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke  Eastwood's girlfriend at the time)
It seems Miss Lilly, as Doc (Scatman Crothers) calls her, is a would-be heiress who will only receive her long-deceased father's estate if she's married by the time she turns 30, so on the eve of that birthday she gets hitched to the cartoonish Geoffrey Lewis
<br /><br />So, what's the plot of this film? It's hard to say
There's the romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilly, but the problem is that for the first half of the movie she's so haughtily insipid and detestable that when she suddenly becomes 'one of the troupe' halfway through the film, it's not only unbelievable, but the audience is well past caring about her
There's the chronic lack of funds behind the Wild West show, but this topic isn't touched upon enough to really be the raison d'etre of the film
There's Miss Lilly's predicament of being stranded in the rural west, cut off from the funds that fuel her spoiled life of luxury (she's mistakenly believed to be dead by her family and the press)
But are we really supposed to believe that she couldn't get back to New York and her waiting fortune if she gave it a bit of effort?<br /><br />No, the point of this film seems to be that Billy is the leader of a family, a lovable bunch of losers who hang together through thick and thin
This is a warm, fuzzy film  or at least tries to be
<br /><br />Along the way, Clint shows us his skills with a gun, even foiling a bank robbery in a shooting that is grotesquely out of place in an otherwise relatively non-violent film
One of the gang is arrested on an old draft evasion charge; Billy bribes the local sheriff
The show's tent burns down; an orphanage makes them a new one
But numerous mundane pitfalls do not a plot make
<br /><br />Compounding the problem is the acting, or lack thereof
Aside from Scatman Crothers, the supporting cast is quite amateurish
Eastwood isn't on top of his game either, though he looks better simply by virtue of being surrounded by such a lackluster bunch
<br /><br />And for all this, the film plods on for 116 minutes
To what point? Good question  <br /><br />4 out of 1
What a bad, bad movie! I tried watching without fast forwarding
After about 30 minutes I stopped the movie, went on-line to see how many minutes this disaster was
(Only 84 minutes, Whew!) It was a confusing, boring movie
I don't think anyone can get knocked down by getting hit with a fluorescent bulb much less gutted by one!! The one funny thing is that I watched "The Killer Cut" version of the movie
The box boldly states "More Blood!" "More Sex!" "More Terror than the theatrical release!" Yikes! If this movie was horrible with all those claims I wonder just how lame the "UN-Killer Cut" was??? If you want to see a great movie about the world of the living & the world of the dead watch any of The Night of the Living Dead series!
This film, The Alamo:Thirteen Days to Glory, is utter rubbish
The acting is awful, it is far too patriotic and its historical accuracy is not always at its best (Historians would have a field day)
It does have a few good moments but not enough to keep interest because it is far too long
As a Turkish man now living in Sweden I must confess I often watch Scandinavian movies
I think actors from Scandinavia work best in Hollywood
Last week I watched a film called "The Polish Wedding" together with a polish friend of mine and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched
Unfortunately I was wrong this movie " House of Angels" is even worse
None of the actors can act, absolutely not the female so called star Helen Bergstrom
The plot is so silly nobody can believe it
I think the whole thing is a mess from the start
lots of bad acting except from Selldal and Wollter
This is an hybrid creature born at Carl Macek mind
With Robotech the second generation (Robotech Masters) and Megazone 23 into one miserable movie, that have no logic! The story is very, very bad, and you cannot forgive the action of Megazone when have nothing to do with Robotech
If this movie have so high rank is for the TV series and not for itself!! I did said it, the name cannot save this
I really looked forward to seeing Nana after seeing Renoir amazing debut work, Whirlpool of Fate
I had read that Nana was generally considered his best silent film so I had high hopes
Sadly this felt like a huge step backwards
<br /><br />Catherine Hessling is the main problem with this film
Her acting is over the top, even for a silent film
Her acting is more like what one would expect in a film from the early teens, not the late 20s
She usually has the same face, which reminds me (sorry to say) of someone with constipation pains
It was also very difficult to believe that any man would fall for this femme fatale
There was nothing charming about her at all
<br /><br />The film was also quite long drawn, the camera work was uninteresting (aside from a shot of a horse race) and the editing was dull
The story reminded me of Pabst's Pandora's Box
It is interesting to compare the two because there are only 3 years between these films
Pandora's Box simply scores on every level where Nana fails
<br /><br />This film is only for Renoir completists or very serious silent films buffs
You'll notice that the chemist, who appears in two scenes and gets to speak, is played by Stephen King
"Don't give up your day job" is the standard thing to say, but that's not fair
King acquits himself reasonably well: he's no worse than any other member of the cast, and better than most
The story, on the other hand, is pure rubbish
<br /><br />Never have I seen so many dreadful performances - of which the lead actor's (the LEAD ACTOR'S!) is probably the worst - gathered together in the one film
Everyone acts hammily, but not in any entertaining way; they all somehow manage to go over-the-top without expending, or manifesting, energy
I blame screenwriter/director Tom Holland
It can't be that ALL the actors are REALLY this bad
What are the odds against that? Admittedly, I've never heard of any of them before, but still, I don't think I could walk into a talent agency and walk out with this many bad performers if I tried: ONE actor, despite my best efforts, would turn out to have talent
So what's more likely - that Tom Holland rolled a dozen consecutive snake-eyes, or that he wrote a lousy script and then directed it poorly? That would also explain why actors are bad in direct proportion to their prominence in the script
The more direction an actor got, the worse he performed
("You want me to bend over like a hunchback, talk from the back of my throat, show all my teeth, and look bored, all at the same time? Okay
")<br /><br />This theory is confirmed by the fact that Holland undeniably managed to co-write a lousy script
Several writers here have commented on the fact that Billy Halleck is not a likeable character, but that's a misleading way of putting it
All we find out about him before the supernatural stuff starts happening is that he's fat, and that all he can think about is food
("All I can think about is food," he tells us, helpfully
<br /><br />(Sigh) I suppose I ought insert a spoiler warning here
Perhaps he's under some kind of enchantment
By "evil" perhaps I mean "inexplicable" - it's not so much badness as a socially undesirable suspension of ordinary means-end psychology
Anyway, his actions at the end make no sense, nobody's actions make much sense, and this is despite the fact that the characters do little but explain their motivation for the benefit of the audience
<br /><br />By the way, here's my nominee for hammiest line/delivery: "I don't think you'd like it
I always found Betsy Drake rather creepy, and this movie reinforces that
As another review said, this is a stalker movie that isn't very funny
I watched it because it has CG in it, but he hardly gets any screen time
Seriously, I'm all for gooey romantic comedies and will get sucked into Miss Congeniality as easily as Goodfellas
but this movie? It doesn't make any sense!!!! And I'm not even talking about the willing suspension of disbelief kind of not making sense
Why does her family live in England? Or, at the very least, why doesn't she have a British accent? She's sure cozy with her dad and he's surprisingly forgiving of her not being around for the last two years
(On that subject, no one ever makes much of a deal about her being away for so long)
And what was with the goofy outfits at the bachelorette party? I'm not even going to get into the fact that the escort she paid for falls in love with her--that could've been overcome by better movie-making
I'm just saying that the characters, the setting, and the plot aren't fleshed out enough to make an even somewhat cohesive story
Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is the filmmaker's consistent use of the most unflattering angles on Deborah Messing's nose--I'd have sued the filmmakers if I were her! I mean, honestly, I'm all for women being who they are, but why, in seven loyal years of Will and Grace viewing, have I not ever noticed how incredibly odd her nose is? Oh! Because those producers are kind to her! This movie, like my other least favorite movie ever, Armageddon, is the fault of the filmmakers, not the actors
I can see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with a better writer, director, and producer
<br /><br />This easily gets my vote as one of the worst movies I've ever wasted time on
I'm just glad a friend loaned me her DVD, so all I wasted was time
If there were a way to make this review ZERO stars, I'd do it
I've never been impressed by JD anyway, and Final Justice (which I hadn't seen prior to its MST3k airing) proves to be no exception
It's not that the character is any less likeable than Mitchell: it's just that there's less that Geronimo ("Call me 'Heronimo') to dislike
<br /><br />In fact, one suspects that Mitchell and Final Justice were all schemes of a revenge-seeking agent of Joe Don's trying to get the "star" killed by inducing a heart attack
<br /><br />Joe Don must have found a new agent, since he's now graduated to "comic relief" in James Bond movies
The problem is, it's hard to tell the difference between his comedy characters there, and his "serious" characters in his action-movies like this one
umm, what plot? They repeat the same set pieces so repeatedly you'll think you were watching Groundhog's Day 2
Presumably, the fact they keep using the same scene of Geronimo getting out of jail is supposed to be comic relief of some sort
<br /><br />On the plus side, the Malta scenery is pretty gorgeous, so that kicked it up to a 2 for me
One suspects this flick set Maltese tourism back a couple of decades, though
Very much a film from the times -- extremely long sequences with no dialogue, bad flashbacks, and an almost entirely male cast
The two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men
<br /><br />O'Toole is riveting whenever he speaks; unfortunately, he spends much of his time peering through shrubbery
Alastair Sims is always a joy to see but he, too, is terribly underused
<br /><br />The film has one additional positive aspect, in that it depicts many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathies (such as the casual appearance of the Mosley graffiti) that many people today are unaware of
Too many of today's films about WWII paint the Allies as all-good and the Axis as all-evil, when history tells us people are far more complicated than that!<br /><br />This would be a good movie for when you're recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and not able to absorb anything too complex
If you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize, this is the movie for you
How could I best express my feelings about this movie: hideous? a headache? lack of coherent writing? plain stupidity? Try all of the above for this travesty
<br /><br />Story? Well I guess there is a story
Two dumb blondes look for a job after they crash a plane into a golf course
They are mistaken for a 'world renounced assassin' (sarcasm) and are 'hired' by two 'mobsters'
One thinks "taking him out" means a date, and the other gets the minor actor she dreams of
And of course, the turtle reserve for the farting turtle, that they build with the casino winnings
<br /><br />Sounds likes all this could be funny? Guess again
I've seen better filming in Hong Kong movies
<br /><br />Not worth my time to ever watch this again
It still doesn't beat Danny Glover's "Out" movie from the early 80s as the worst movie of all time, but then again that film is in a class of its own
After watching this movie on DVD, I watched the trailer
The voice-over describes the movie as surreal
Well, there's surreal, and there's surreal
<br /><br />There was really only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me, but frankly, it was more confusing than surreal
The other unusual imagery, particularly the lunchroom scene where everybody is on the floor, were so nonsensical they had no meaning
I don't mind imagery that doesn't mean anything, but these scenes just seemed irrelevant
<br /><br />My impression is that the director was trying to convey Logan's inner monologue
I don't know what else would explain what was going on
Unfortunately, nothing I saw gave me any clue what Logan was thinking about, what his perspective was, or even his emotional state
All I could tell was that he wasn't particularly happy with his physical appearance, and that he had a crush on an older boy
<br /><br />I thought the ending signaled what the relationship between the boys had become, but not much else did
Purposely juxtaposing ambiguous scenes with those that were more straightforward seemed more like a cop out than an artistic decision
<br /><br />Still, as tiresome and as content-free the movie was for me, it was a definite change of pace
I very much liked Madagascar Skin, and I had the feeling this movie aspired to that kind of narrative, and perhaps even style
For me there's no question about it: this movie deserves an A for effort, but a D for execution
here, let me wave my hands over the keyboard, i'll tell you what salad she's going to order
over and over, works like a charm: he's such a genius, omg how does he do it? my bullshit detector freaks if i even pass this show when i'm scanning channels, I have to be very careful (these days it's useful far too often, so I don't need it getting broken on idiotic crap like this
is this supposed to be some fascist propaganda to make people believe in some invisible realm of uberman control and mastery? or what? why does it exist??<br /><br />this is THE most inane show, completely unbelievable and contrived, and I cannot understand why it's still on the air
so may geeks give SO much better shows such a hard time (Sarah Connor Chronicles, True Blood), but give this nonsensical drivel a pass
shows like Firefly (if there were any like that) fall away after a season, but mindless stuff like this that makes zero logical sense just keeps marching on
Seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie, I figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasn't quite meant to be
I watched the first two fight scenes, listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by Lungren, and all of the other thrown-in Oriental actors, and I found the movie so awful that it was funny
Then Brandon Lee enters the story and the one-liners start flying, the plot falls apart, the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out it's welcome, as it turns into the worst action movie EVER
<br /><br />Lungren beats out his previous efforts in "The Punisher" and others, as well as all of Van Damme's movies, Seagal's movies, and Stallone's non-Rocky movies, for this distinct honor
This movie has the absolute worst acting (check out Tia Carrere's face when she is in any scene with Dolph, that's worth a laugh), with the worst dialogue ever (Brandon Lee's comment about little Dolph is the worst line ever in a film), and the worst outfit in a film (Dolph in full Japanese attire)
Picture "Tango and Cash" with worse acting, meets "Commando," meets "Friday the 13th" (because of the senseless nudity and Lungren's performance is very Jason Voorhees-like), in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a movie
<br /><br />The good (how about not awful) performances go to the bad guy (who still looks constipated through his entire performance) and Carrere (who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing)
Brandon Lee is just there being Lungren's sidekick, and doing a really awful job at that
If you do watch it though, ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non-underwater shots
Speaking of the underwater shots, check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fight-scene-ending ever
This movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fill-in between the flashes of nudity
<br /><br />A BAD BAD MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ziab la ta'kol al lahem is an awful movie
This is only a superposition of scenes without a clear link
Acting is also very bad, despite the presence of a good actor like Ezzat El allayli
But something is really astonishing in this movie, talking about sexuality, emancipation of women, nude scenes are very rare in Arab cinema,even in this days
I really congratulate the director and the actors for their courage
We want to see more of this style in Egyptian movies, but with better quality
The reasons that led me to vote this film as an awful one are not only scenario and acting, but also the lack of prfessionalism
If you want a good arab movie Ziab la ta'kol al lahm is not the one recommended
But if you wish to encourage the uncensored movies in all the arab world watch it and make your friends and your family do the same
This is another example of a sucky sequel to a great movie
I highly recommend The Prophecy, but this movie was a dud from the start
The acting was decent all the way around, but the story line was weak and added nothing to the origional
You probably heard this phrase when it come to this movie  "Herbie: Fully Loaded with crap" and yes it is true
This movie is really dreadful and totally lame
<br /><br />This got to be the second worst movie Lindsey is ever in since Confession of the Teenage Drama Queen
The only good thing about this movie seem to be the over talent cast which by far is better than the movie million times and is the only selling point of the movie
I don't see how such a respected actor like Matt Dillon could be a part of this movie, isn't he read that horrible screenplay before he sign on to be in it? <br /><br />What I didn't like about this movie is also base on how Herbie is surreal and fantasy like extraordinary ability and climb on wall and go faster than a racer car after all it just a Beatle
I know it is a kids movie but they have gone overboard with it and it just turn out more silly than entertaining
Little realism is needed plus the story is way too predictable
<br /><br />Final Words: Unless the kids are actually 5 -12 years I highly doubt that any one could enjoy this senseless movie
That word 'True' in this film's title got my alarm bells ringing
They rang louder when a title card referred to America's Civil War as the 'War Between the States' (the circumlocution preferred by die-hard southerners)
Jesse James -- thief, slave-holder and murderer -- is described as a quiet, gentle farm boy
<br /><br />How dishonest is this movie? There is NO mention of slavery, far less of the documented fact that Jesse James's poor widdered mother owned slaves before the war, and that Jesse and his brother Frank actively fought to preserve slavery
According to this movie, all those Civil War soldiers were really fighting to decide whether Missouri is a northern state or a southern state
(Missouri: It's a candy mint! It's a breath mint!) Black people are entirely absent from this movie, except for two glimpses of a pair of beggars, one of whom wears a "HELP THE POOR" sign that's very implausibly typeset instead of handwritten
(Some shots of 19th-century newspapers are inaccurate too, with 20th-century type fonts
)<br /><br />This film has a weird flashback structure
There's some very impressive stunt riding (and some fine work by stunt horses), and one excellent montage
I savoured one line of dialogue: 'Some of those boys will never taste beans again
' The movie gets a few facts straight: Agnes Moorehead, as Jesse's mother, conceals her right arm in the scenes following the raid by the agents of Pinkerton (here called 'Remington') in which Jesse James's real-life mother suffered injuries requiring the amputation of her lower arm
Some errors here are pardonable: during his bushwhacking days, the real Jesse James accidentally shot off part of his left middle finger, but Robert Wagner (in the title role here) does not have a stumpfinger
I've seen a photo of Jesse James's real wife; if she had looked half as glamorous as Hope Lange looks in this movie, Jesse James might have stayed home more
<br /><br />There's plenty of revisionism here, and most of the male actors wear 1950s hairstyles
But many of this movie's errors were avoidable
Jesse James's mentor William Quantrill is mentioned several times, but all the actors mispronounce his name
We see Jesse and his wife moving into an elaborate two-storey house (where he will soon die) after paying a rent of $18
Actually, Jesse James's last residence (at 1318 Lafayette Street, St Joseph, Missouri) was a simple one-storey cottage, renting for $14
so, when Jesse James is killed, his wife could not come running from upstairs as Hope Lange does here
)<br /><br />One continuity error: Robert Wagner (with no stunt double) does an impressive job of taking a slug to the jaw and falling over while his hands are tied behind his back
but when he gets up, the rope binding his wrists has vanished
<br /><br />The screenplay does some weird and unnecessary juggling of dates
Following the Northfield robbery attempt, Jesse says he expects to get home by his birthday
The actual Northfield bank raid by the James Gang (7 September, 1876) was two days AFTER Jesse James's birthday
) Later, we see Jesse and his wife moving into their St Joseph home on a fine summer day, while Jesse tells her what he plans to do when Christmas Eve arrives
but in real life, Mr and Mrs Jesse James moved into that house on 24 December, 1881
so this scene should *BE* on Christmas Eve! These errors were entirely avoidable
<br /><br />Some of the fictionalisations here don't make sense
According to this movie, the Northfield bank raid failed because one (fictional) henchman was late in cutting the telegraph wires
If this had actually happened, it would indeed have hampered the James Gang's getaway
but it wouldn't have affected the robbery itself, which failed for other reasons
<br /><br />There are good performances here by Jeffrey Hunter (as Frank James), Moorehead, Alan Hale Jnr (as Cole Younger) and by stage actress Marian Seldes in a rare screen role
I was disappointed by Robert Wagner, normally an under-rated actor
Elsewhere, Wagner has proved his impressive range by convincingly portraying heroes, villains and morally ambiguous characters
Here, he can't seem to decide whether to depict Jesse James as a goodie or a baddie
John Carradine phones in his performance in a brief role as a fictional jackleg preacher who baptises Jesse and his wife at their wedding
In fact, Jesse James was baptised in childhood by his uncle, a Methodist minister
but perhaps this second baptism is a topping-up
<br /><br />Jesse James was no Robin Hood
(I doubt that Robin Hood was Robin Hood either, but that's another story
) There is not one single documented instance of Jesse James ever sharing his loot with anyone beyond his own family
After some of his hold-ups, he didn't even split the swag with the rest of his gang
In this movie, Jesse gets gunned down right after he vows to give up his bandit ways forever
In reality, the night before his death, Jesse James and the Ford brothers stole horses that Jesse planned to use the next day in a robbery of the Platte City bank
As preparation for most of his robberies, Jesse James stole horses from local farmers
the same poor folk who (in the inaccurate legends) were supposedly the beneficiaries of his largesse
I cringed at one scene here, in which the fictional Jesse James is so gol-durn refined that he disapproves of an oil painting which tastefully depicts nudes
<br /><br />'The True (not much!) Story of Jesse James' is wilfully dishonest about a thieving murderer, and likewise dishonest about the Civil War
For the very impressive stunt work, one good montage and a few fine acting turns, I'll rate this obscenely dishonest movie 2 points out of 10
She just dreams her life away and wonders, why she does not feel fulfilled
That would need a good story, a nice setting and good dialogues
But although I am a huge fan of his, I couldn't stand this movie
The movie is not as bad as "King Uncle" and if you're an Art-house fan or like it slow, you might maybe like it
It's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not catching
This movie was poorly written, poorly acted and very predictable
It was very low-budget and I can understand why it was never released and went straight to video
It wasn't even campy fun, it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could get the 1-1/2 hours back! The colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them
<br /><br />The plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing -- what a stretch! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre
Just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this
First off, to give you some idea of my taste in movies
<br /><br />2007 Comedies I enjoyed: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades Of Glory <br /><br />2007 Comedies I hated: Evan Almighty, The Brothers Solomon, Good Luck Chuck<br /><br />I should have followed my first instinct and turned off "Hot Rod" after I got to about the 20 minute mark
I knew by that point that this movie would not make me laugh once
The script is absolutely brutal - I have no idea how this monstrosity managed to crack 6 on IMDb
Any one older than 10 years old who enjoyed this must be some kind of mental defective
<br /><br />This doesn't come close to anything with Will Farrell and it's clear that Andy Samberg can't carry anything longer than a 5 to 10 minute sketch on YouTube or SNL
I don't know how they roped Ian McShane and Isla Fisher into doing this movie
I came in knowing that it would be a dumb movie, but I thought it would at least be funny
<br /><br />I don't normally comment on movies at IMDb, but this was so awful, I just had to warn people
This is only the 4th movie I've seen that I've felt compelled to rate 1/10
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Long time inmate Twitch (Kurupt) gets himself transfered to a tougher prison than the re-opened Alcatraz
He claims it's to be closer to his lady but his real motives are a bit more grandiose
There he crosses paths with Burke (Bill Goldberg) a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself
Twitch, despite being less muscular, is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same
But there is a gang war brewing between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black's gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at Burke
But the sh!t really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter hostage
<br /><br />Steven Seagal doesn't do sequels (reportedly very opposed to the idea of Under Siege 2 and only agreeing to do it on the condition the film company he was with at the time let direct his own movie) so despite this being a DVD sequel, the lead role this time round goes to Bill Golberg (Steve doesn't even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the end
) But there's a reason he hasn't done much work since Universal Soldier 2 and that's because he's not much of an actor, and not much of an action star either, managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but unsubtly turns into a standard action hero awkwardly quipping off dull one-liners
Support wise, veterans from the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, have merely jumped at the chance of extra work
<br /><br />This is a film that's tried to copy the style of the original quite well, with the dim lighting, dark shadows and rap music playing over a lot of it
It does this quite well, unfortunately it can't contend with an unengaging hero, an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along
Some of these viewer comments are just ridiculous
Not painful to watch with your significant other? I was apologizing to my boyfriend the entire movie
<br /><br />It was so slow and awfully strange
<br /><br />Both Redgraves,Vanessa and Natasha were unfit for this, especially with Vanessa doing that ridiculous brash American accent
<br /><br />Claire Danes was the same wiggly-lipped awkward girl that she was in My So-Called Life
Girl, find a new way to pretend to cry! <br /><br />Meryl Streep was one of the only redeeming part of this movie, she was on screen for five minutes, and I swear to God, she reached out of the movie screen and slapped me awake
<br /><br />Oh! And Hugh Dancy, who gets better every time I see him
<br /><br />Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes
<br /><br />I mean, this was a well-shot movie, it was very pretty, the settings were interestingly dressed, providing relief for the intense boredom I was feeling
<br /><br />I don't know, It's just pretty pathetic when a movie that boasts a cast comprised of "The greatest actresses of our time" sucks so much
It sure had more than a few noticeable editing errors, and the main character (Ann) was a huge jerk
But that's because I felt bad for Lila, Ann's friend -- mostly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy
You weren't entertaining and you weren't even thought-provoking
I sure hope the book was better, so it didn't waste even more of people's time
Following the appalling Attack Force, chances were that Seagal could only have a step up with Flight Of Fury
To out-stink Attack Force would take some doing
Flight Of Fury is a marked improvement overall, but still in the grand scheme of thinks, mediocre
Mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for Seagal these days, a sad insight into his movie career's decline
Where Attack Force was a hodge-podge of plot lines altered drastically from conception, to filming, to post production, Flight Of Fury keeps the plot line more simple
Someone steals a high-tech stealth fighter, planning to use it to fire chemical weapons (which we later, bizarrely discover, will destroy the whole world in 48 hrs)
It's that simple, no annoying sub-plots, and conspiracies weighing the film down like far too many of his recent works
That's not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though, it's pretty poor
The introduction to side characters is badly done for example
It's badly acted by all involved, and Seagal looks bored to tears almost
He's just got the look of a toddler who's been forced to perform the school nativity against his will, and so performs with a constant grimace and air of half assedness
Can we blame Seagal though when the material is so un-ambitious and cruddy? Not really
This is the final film of his Castel Studio's, multi-picture deal
The producers can't be bothered to make anything remotely good, promising a 12 or so million dollar budget, and (after Seagal's obligatory 5 million) probably pocketing a nice hefty chunk of it themselves (If the film was made for the remaining 7 million, then I'm Elvis Pressley!)
So in that respect why should Seagal put the effort into a film that's already got distribution sorted before it's made
Fan's though may argue, he at least owes them the effort
He's seriously looking jaded, and the continued use of stand ins and dub-overs is further indication of this
Michael Keusch directs with some efficiency, while the cinematography is quite good, but in all technical areas (and as usual with Castel, a bog standard stunt team) there's nothing more than mediocrity, and nothing to help the film rise above its material, and bored leading man
Again there's a few action scenes focusing on characters other than Seagal, which in all truth we don't want to see
<br /><br />Overall the action isn't too bad
It's nice and violent, and on occasion we're treated to a few vintage nasty Seagal beatings, but overall nothing special
Partly due to a poor stunt crew, and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting
For me, Shadow Man was a more enjoyable film, because while ignoring the incoherent, jumbled, plot line, there were more vintage Seagal moments, and more of him in centre stage
He never disappeared for long periods during the film
Seagal disappears bizarrely during one action scene here, and re-appears after, with little explanation
Using stock shots isn't an entirely horrendous thing, but using it as a crutch is
We're treated to countless establishing shots of naval ships, all the time, which get annoying
Plus the continuity of the stock footage is all over the place (just check the backdrops, chopping and changing)
<br /><br />The film is just middle of the road
It says it all that the films best scene is a completely needless, and gratuitous girl on girl scene, with two hot chicks
Seagal even perks up briefly then too! Overall this may be one of the better stock footage based actioners out there, but that's not saying much at all
This will please many fans, but they should bear in mind, Seagal himself would probably want to forget this one's existence
But only today I went through the trouble of registering on the site, just so I could give this movie the lowest possible rating
I've seen hundreds of films, some of them bad, a few awful
Never, though, have i seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence, of high intentions and failure
<br /><br />Mira Sorvino is horribly cast as the princess, but entirely unbelievable as Phocion, a young boy
Fiona Shaw is always an entertaining character, but the dialogue in the film is much worse, even, than in the insipid French play that is the source (Marivaux never reached Hollywood until now, and we should keep it that way)
<br /><br />To illustrate, for example, that Leontine is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from beaker to beaker, shouting out names of famous scientists
And the romance between Agis and the princess is played even sillier
For this, the pair should receive a joint 'Clair Danes' award, which in a just world would be awarded for gratuitously anachronistic and uninspired re-interpretation of interesting teens from literature as brats of the 1990's (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables)
<br /><br />Aside from the atrocious plot and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the filming
For example, there are moments when a handful of spectators are faded in and out of view of the action, sitting in chairs, watching the principal characters
The Director wants us to realize she's adapted a play
But it doesn't happen at all until far into the film
At that point, seeing a crowd of people sitting in chairs for a moment, then disappearing, is creepy and distracting
They're like some sort of un-scary zombie crowd, appearing through the mists, filling us with dread
When you see the horrible frolic and song that ends this movie, you'll want to rouse your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for the grave injustise of poisoning your mind for 112 minutes
Van Dien must cringe with embarrassment at the memory of this ludicrously poor film, as indeed must every single individual involved
To be honest I am rather embarrassed to admit I watched it from start to finish
Production values are somewhere between the original series of 'Crossroads' and 'Prisoner Cell Block H'
Most five year olds would be able to come up with more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot
As for the acting performances, if you can imagine the most rubbish porno you have ever seen - one of those ones where the action is padded out with some interminable 'story' to explain how some pouting old peroxide blonde boiler has come to be getting spit-roasted by a couple of blokes with moustaches - you will have some idea of the standard of acting in 'Maiden Voyage'
Worse still, you can't even fast forward to the sex scenes, because there aren't any
I'd give this a negative rating if I could
I went into this movie not expecting much, but I had an open mind
The whole thing is stupid! The snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson
Oh how original; if I were a 12 year old boy I might laugh at that
I have no idea how this movie became so popular
I wasn't entertained, it wasn't funny,I wasn't even bored! I wasn't anything
It wasn't even so bad it was good, it's just bad
Please do not waste your money on this movie
No clue how it's getting such a high rating
Man, this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books
Frankly, I found it too slow and unappealing right from the start
I kept waiting for it to pick up a little steam but that never happened
<br /><br />Shakespeare, with the King James English, has never appealed to me, anyway, so it may just be me
There is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film as they show Ronald Colman playing the role of Othello
<br /><br />The good points of the film include - thanks to a restored print - some decent cinematography and a young, slim and attractive Shelly Winters
<br /><br />Overall, this is simply too boring, too much repetition in some of the scenes to watch again
Besides, we all know that most actors are nut-cases, anyway, but kudos to Hollywood for demonstrating it here in this story
Weak,stale, tired, cliched; wants to be Basic Instinct, but misses opportunity after opportunity for fresh perspectives, new insights
Insipid, trite, grotesque, and without the possibly-redeeming value of brevity; oh, wait
it must have just *seemed* a lot longer! I'd rather clean bus station toilets with my toothbrush than have to sit through this again
I'm expressing an opinion here: I guess this means I didn't like it
I honestly believe that ANYONE considering film-making be subjected to this mind-boggling failure
in the '60s and '70s, this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts, re-editing their films, and reworking their special effects until they finally look right
This movie is also a decent argument FOR the studios' pre-screening process
Hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience, perhaps he would have cut 75% or the walking/running/strolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable 90 minutes
<br /><br />Film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is "good enough" can truly be
Every performance, every line of dialog, every digital effect, every filter effect, indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity
A beginning filmmaker may find himself/herself tempted from time to time to think "At least I accomplished SOMETHING" or "Just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself"
This movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn out
<br /><br />Critics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment "the worst movie ever made"
<br /><br />Beginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are, and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites
Also, beginning directors can learn the importance of a GOOD screenplay, and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story
Writers and directors who watch bad made-for-cable movies of the week and think "I can do better than THAT" can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really IS to produce even mediocre results
<br /><br />I sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers
Particularly those entering the craft in this current post-Lucas and post-Spielberg environment
There is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects
The War of the Worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off
From the very get go I found it extremely hard to like this movie, and now after a little thinking about it I can pretty much pinpoint the reason why
Jean-Marc Barr, although I love him to bits (I think Zentropa is one of the best movies ever made) is quite miscast here, and although I can't figure for the life of me who would be better, I am sure someone could have taken his place quite easily and make this film work
Everything else is fine, except for the stabs at weak comedy (A Meet The Parents Joke is not really needed, filmmakers!) and I really like Richard E
I had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a Yashraj Film
<br /><br />Jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by Pooja Singh to teach her boss, Lakhan Singh, English
The two fall in love and decide to run away but Pooja tells Jimmy that she can't do this as she owes a debt to Lakhan Singh, who is also known as Bhaiyyaji
But they decide and steal money from him and its only then that Jimmy finds out that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is a Don
In the meantime, Bhaiyyaji hires a man, Bachchan Pandey, to track down Jimmy and Pooja
<br /><br />Starring Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar, the movie is directed by first time director Viay Krishna Acharya and is produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra
<br /><br />"Tashan" has to be one of the worse films that I have ever watched
Yes! The scenery is good and Kareena Kapoor (and her much publicised weight loss) looks good
But plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other - hence why I have said at the beginning that I had expected more from this film as it was a Yashraj Production
With reference to songs, unfortunately, there is not one song that I can remember now
<br /><br />There are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to Akshaye Kumar and Saif could have definitely done better while Kareena Kapoor played her part well
But this cannot be said for Anil Kapoor - it did not suit him at all as a villain
Lastly,never mind Aditya Chopra, who in the past has produced and directed good films such as "Mohabbatein," what was Yash Chopra doing by producing such a trash movie? <br /><br />Conclusion: Bad movie, not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression
Unless somebody enlightens me, I really have no idea what this movie is about
It looks like a picture with a message but it´s far from it
This movie tells pointless story of a New York press agent and about his problems
When that agent is played by Pacino, one must think that it must be something important
But it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is
To one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second movie of the year (the other is "Simone") that deserves the title "the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year"
Oh my GOD this was so bad! The story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish
I saw this last week at the London Sci-Fi Festival and the entire audience was laughing at every scene
I think my favourite was 'shouldn't you be studying medicine at Oopsalof'! And I also think they were trying to see how many times they could cram in the character Nicalo's only line 'we will be together
' I'm sorry but after the first time, the words lost all meaning
<br /><br />And what was with the apple?<br /><br />I recommend this as a lesson to Americans: You cannot animate, so please don't try
It's not really any good, but it's great to laugh at
The dialogue can become incredibly ludicrous and poorly acted (eg, "Manji, can we ask you a few questions?" "Sure
" "We think you can help us with the answers
") Any fighting is more or less surrealistic
Make sure to watch for Brock, the oafy white guy who attacks the main characters
He only has two lines, but he's one of the best guys in the movie
Much of "Over Her Dead Body" is so painfully unfunny that I was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors
<br /><br />Eva Longoria proves that she can't carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy, and further, that she doesn't really even have any comedic timing
She's grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fiancé
The fiancé is played by Paul Rudd, drippy and charmless, while the psychic is played by Lake Bell, bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has
I felt most sorry for Bell, as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work
Unfortunately, she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features Jason Biggs tolerable, and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like Leo DiCaprio at the end of "Titanic
" <br /><br />"Over Her Dead Body" actually pi**ed me off, because of its laziness and utter lack of effort
I started to think of all the interesting projects that can't get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this
Seriously, does Hollywood think movies like this are good enough? How stupid do they really think the movie-going public is? <br /><br />Grade:
Before I explain the "Alias" comment let me say that "The Desert Trail" is bad even by the standards of westerns staring The Three Stooges
In fact it features Carmen Laroux as semi- bad girl Juanita, when you hear her Mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as Senorita Rita from the classic Stooge short "Saved by the Belle"
<br /><br />In "The Desert Trail" John Wayne gets to play the Moe Howard character and Eddy Chandler gets to play Curly Howard
Like their Stooge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53- minute movie is Moe hitting Curly
Wayne's character, a skirt chasing bully, is not very endearing, but is supposed to be the good guy
<br /><br />Playing a traveling rodeo cowboy Wayne holds up the rodeo box office at gunpoint and takes the prize money he would have won if the attendance proceeds had been good-the other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar (actually even less after Wayne robs the box office)
No explanation is given for Wayne's ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl
<br /><br />Things get complicated at this point because the villain (Al Ferguson) and his sidekick Larry Fine (played by Paul Fix-who would go on to play Sheriff Micah on television's "The Rifleman") see Wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager
<br /><br />So Moe and Curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to Smith and Jones
Who do they meet first but their old friend Larry, whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest (Senorita Rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie)
<br /><br />Larry's sister is nicely played by a radiantly beautiful Mary Kornman (now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of Hal Roach's "Our Gang" shorts)
Kornman is the main reason to watch the mega-lame western and her scenes with Moe and Curly are much better than any others in the production, as if they used an entirely different crew to film them
<br /><br />Even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film- making is staggeringly bad
The two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse
Both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground, but there is no horse in the frame, the film stock is completely different, and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider
There is liberal use of stock footage in other places, none of it even remotely convincing
<br /><br />One thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where Moe and Curly get on their horses and ride away (to screen right) from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left
The cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse
Outside of home movies I have never seen anything like this, not because it is looks stupid (which it does) but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner
They would film the two riders leaving and then reposition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action
Or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background
<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child
Tara Reid needs to be stopped before she's put in another movie
Stephen Dorff looks like he got his character's motivation from Val Kilmer in "Top Gun"
The direction, editing, sound (do we really need a heavy-metal video in the middle of a gunfight?), costumes (bulletproof vests with muscles on them), and hey, there's no discernible plot either
It amazes me that no one attached to the project stopped and said, "hey guys, this just doesn't make any sense, let's start over"
Hopefully Slater's career can rebound from this disaster
<br /><br />Hands down the worst film I've ever seen
Michael Caine has always claimed that Ashanti was "the only film (he) did purely for the money" as well as "the worst film he ever starred in"
Hold on, Michael, weren't you in The Swarm and Hurry Sundown? And weren't both of those films a good deal worse than Ashanti? Perhaps Caine remembers only too begrudgingly the physically punishing demands of filming an action film in searing 130 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures (the director, Richard Fleischer, was hospitalised as a result of sun-stroke during the shoot)
What Ashanti actually emerges as is not the career low-point of Michael Caine
Instead, it is a very average chase thriller with a talented cast, exotic locations, boring stretches and a highly formulaic storyline
O medic who is left devastated when his black wife Anansa (Beverly Johnson) goes missing during an aid trip to an African tribal village
Linderby gradually realises that his wife has been snatched by slave traders - led by Suleiman (Peter Ustinov) - and he sets off on a continent-wide pursuit which eventually leads to the Middle East
<br /><br />Along the way, big stars pop in for ineffective and superfluous guest roles
William Holden has a poor cameo as a chopper pilot; Omar Sharif displays little of his customary charm or grace as a pampered Arab millionaire; Rex Harrison looks rightfully bored during his brief role as a helpful contact who assists Caine in his quest
The film is based on a best-seller entitled Ebano, by the little-known author Alberto Vasquez-Figueroa, but the suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation
Ustinov is charismatic as the slaver (he seems in all his movies to be incapable of giving bad performances), and Caine generates believable anguish as the man who thinks he'll never see his wife again
There are occasional flashes of action, but on the whole Ashanti is quite slow-moving
All in all, it is a resistible piece of action hokum - not by any stretch as awful as Caine has frequently suggested, but not a very inspiring film and certainly a let-down from all the talent involved
but Thomas Ian Griffith just doesn't have the polish that a big bucks actor has, granted this was made 5+ years ago
Some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make this not only action, but comedy
And how do you get KC out of Katia Koslovska anyhow? Plummer's character was so corny, he would have fit better in a Bullwinkle toon
Personally, if action flicks are going to show skin -- I'd have liked to have seen equal time between female/male, otherwise don't show any
I totally agree with the review by a reviewer of Variety that the film is never quite as funny, lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise would seem to warrant
Narratively it is messy and the lighting is really problematic
If the film is supposed to be character-driven the poor lighting doesn't enhance the acting and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors
Many non-South Africans will have difficulty in following the spoken English in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process
I watched the film at the Cape Town World Cinema festival last year
Comments and reactions to the film ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past
Unfortunately Bunny Chow won't be remembered as one of the bright lights of the South African New Wave, but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our 110 year old film history
Not surprisingly the film disappeared from cinemas in Cape Town only two weeks after its release and from most of the cinemas in Durban and Gauteng
It has clearly limited appeal among South African audiences
I fell asleep the first time I attempted watching it, and I must say I'm not one to ever fall asleep in the cinema
<br /><br />I have never seen such a pointless plot acted in such a stilted and forced manner, and can only surmise that the actors were as hard-up as the protagonist writer allegedly was in the film itself
<br /><br />Everything in this dire adaptation is overacted
And if it isn't the wooden acting, almost as though you can see the teleprompter, then the set itself, which is overlit and interfering in utterly unnecessary ways, and overdressed to an unimaginable extent, is enough to put you off the entire farce
<br /><br />As to the supposed shock of a detective under disguise, any person who does not see that - as well as the entire rest of this ludicrous plot - telegraphed light years in advance, should check their eyesight immediately
<br /><br />Bad acting, and from two very decent actors, coupled with the hyper-coddled Branagh trademark overdirection, is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourself
<br /><br />On top of it all, there is a completely risible undertone of homoerotica in this, heightened towards the end of it
All I can hope for is that this was such a flop that people shan't try to emulate this level of cinema ever again
The real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor
A visual treat to the eye, the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart
I was intrigued, at first, by the idea of Dietrich and Boyer leaving religion in order to "find" their capacity for love
Boyer is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment
Dietrich's amazing wardrobe outshines her performance -- at times her face is frightening to look at -- a unfeeling mask
As a monk, Boyer held the formula for the monastery's liquer (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse) -- when he leaves his "marriage to god" the reaction by his fellow monks holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion
The viewer feels Boyer was well rid of his past
However, the journey that follows is all too predictable
if my grandma did films they would probably do much better figure than this one
the main characters (the mom, the dad and son) are OK
Specially the mother she's a nice actress and the kid also proves to be a nice one specially on the scenes where he is supposed to be scary
But does the the director know the meaning of the words Plot Point, Triller and Good Script
the script hasn't any evolving atmosphere to become a suspense thing
If you like being chased by trees you can probably enjoy it, otherwise just stay at home and sleep
actually there was something funny: the movie's from 2001 but we couldn't realize it since the image is so bad (like on mini-dv) and the cars are so old (like 70 and 80's)
As a pastiche of early 20th century Hollywood artistes it sets a new low - even past The Moderns or (gasp) Cradle Will Rock & I never thought I'd see a film worse than those 2
Granted they were about a slightly different milieu & period
Nevertheless the intents & results were distressingly similar
<br /><br />First off there's the horrible casting: Eddie Izzard as CHAPLIN? Excuse me? Peter, did you owe this guy something? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons?? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies??? Holy smoke, these people don't even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period they are purportedly depicting
<br /><br />Well, Last Picture Show was a decent film, but this thing is a disaster & the rest of Bogdonovitch's pics haven't been much better
Guess rubbing up against Welles & Hitch & Ford wore off a long time ago
this has got to be the DUMBEST movie I've ever seen
I would never, EVER watch this movie again
and my sympathy to those who have ever PAID to see it
This beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons
1) Perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking, but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android
2) It wasn't an android at all, but a woman, the beautiful Jean Marsh
<br /><br />The popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have traced its origins back to this episode if they'd done it properly
In fact, the modernization of sex-bots are in the news as I speak
<br /><br />Robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made, so they could have at least had her act like one
Her fleshiness would then have added a creepy element
Instead, it becomes a nice little love story about two humans on faraway star
<br /><br />The Twilight Zone always stretched the imagination and credulity
But this episode seemed hamstrung by a Calvinist morality eschewing what would have amounted to masturbation with a machine, or downright carelessness
There are just so many things wrong with this movie
<br /><br />To begin with, the first twenty minutes of the film could have been compressed into just five or maybe ten
The overall movie is (mercifully) short already, but this could have been made up for by giving a little more attention to the Mean Lion (how did the miss a reference to "The Wiz" on that one?) and working his subplot a little more closely into the main plot
In short, the script had the seed of a good idea, but needed quite a bit of reworking
<br /><br />Second, it could have done without the crude humor
The original also had some that it could have done without, but at least there it was almost an afterthought -- here, flatulence and urination abound
<br /><br />Third, the show is a little too self-aware
The original series had that well enough, as did the first movie, but here it's just way, way too much
The Brendan Fraser in-jokes were just a bit over the top (and why no mention of the "new Ursula"?)
Other gags with the Narrator, especially a couple of interactions near the end, also exceed good sense
<br /><br />Fourth, a bit more attention could have been given to the CGI work
In the first it was hard to tell that Shemp wasn't a real elephant (except by behavior, of course), but here the CGI stands out like a sore thumb
Ideally special effects should merely tell the story whether they're good or bad, and they at least do succeed on that count, so it's a relatively small problem, but it's still there
<br /><br />All that said, Christopher Showerman's performance as George is decent enough
It lacks Brendan Fraser's charm, but Christopher only really fails in that specific comparison -- he even managed to give George a bit of personal depth, which should have been a major foul in a Jay Ward-inspired movie but wasn't here
Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me as being even better than Leslie Mann in the original
<br /><br />Most other performances were pretty standard, not standing out in my mind as either good or bad
Based on Ray Russell's dark bestseller, this John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) Hough-directed bust has little going for it
<br /><br />Though it does not lack gory violence, it lack narrative sensibility and "characters"
<br /><br />The "Incubus" of the title is a demon endowed with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into vaginas during intercourse -- or, to be more precise, rape
<br /><br />John Cassavetes, moonlighting from his successful directing career, is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women
<br /><br />Horrific possibilities of the victims spawning demonic offspring are not considered -- and neither is the audience's tolerance for slow moving garbage
<br /><br />The script's reluctance to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the major problems with this vapid Big-Schlong-On-The-Loose exercise
WARNING! This review will reveal the ending of the movie, "Scoop
" If you don't want to know how the movie ends, don't read this review!<br /><br />"Scoop" is so bad you'll think "Annie Hall" was a fluke
<br /><br />It gets one star because you get to see Hugh Jackman's naked chest
That's the only thing "Scoop" has going for it
<br /><br />Woody Allen's misogyny, and his fixation on women young enough, at this point, to be his granddaughter, has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point
<br /><br />The plot seems promising: a ghost, Ian McShane, directs a fluffy headed student, Scarlett Johansson, to investigate whether or not an English Lord, Hugh Jackman, is the notorious Tarot Card Killer of prostitutes
<br /><br />Promising plot notwithstanding, the movie completely lacks charm, or humor, or atmosphere
It's an amazingly leaden, amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film, never mind dozens
Perhaps Allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press
<br /><br />Much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films, Woody Allen, now a septuagenarian, has FINALLY allowed a younger male lead to get the girl
In fact, the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one
<br /><br />There is an early scene where Johansson, for no reason central to the movie, allows herself to be gotten drunk, and seduced, by a powerful, older director
"Seduced" is a euphemism for what happens
It's a "slam, bam, I've gotta go" kind of moment
It bears no relation to the plot whatsoever, and it cheapens Johansson in the viewer's eye
Why did Allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie? Because it shows a powerful director - like Allen - having sex with the female lead
Allen gets to have his cake and eat it, too
<br /><br />Johansson is not yet an actress
She doesn't know how to command the screen except by wearing a tight, low cut top
She imitates Allen in a couple of scenes, and that just looks weird and sad
<br /><br />It doesn't help that her character is scripted as a doll who can't function without a ghost, or an elderly and less than awe-inspiring magician, telling her what to do at every turn
<br /><br />She is approximately half Jackman's age, and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes together
<br /><br />Audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines, and Jackman deserves better, too -- a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency, and an actress who can convey those qualities
<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is similarly cheated by the script
Allen apparently can't stand it that Jackman is so stunningly good looking and young, and so he gives Jackman nothing to say or do
Like Johansson, he is used merely for his good looks
This is a shame, because, as Jackman has shown in any number of productions, from "Oklahoma" to "X Men," he CAN act
<br /><br />Here's the big plot twist -- Jackman, suave, charming English Lord, really is a killer
So, though the movie says it is all about letting someone else, other than Allen, get the girl, she doesn't get anyone
Jackman, the man she's been making love to, is a man who murdered a prostitute
Nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp
<br /><br />In a passive aggressive touch, Allen deprives his heroine of his own presence, as well, killing off his character, the magician, leaving Scarlett Johansson all alone at the end of the film
<br /><br />A final note: at my screening, not a single audience member laughed at any point during the film
Always a bad sign when a film is advertised as a comedy
This horrible! The acting, costumes, production values, editing, the script, everything about this film is as bad as it can get
It looks as if it was filmed with a video camera
Can you give a movie a negative rating? Watch The Ring instead
One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it starts to become satire, is that it be somewhat plausible
I would think that an anti-matter bomb would do considerably more damage than for what it was intended
But I'll leave that to the physicists who might have seen Solar Crisis
<br /><br />It is a crisis the earth is facing because solar flares are getting totally out of hand
They're getting close to Earth, so much so that it's become unseasonably hot, as if the entire Earth were Death Valley
The answer is an anti-matter bomb which a space ship will have to take to the sun and explode it there
That will divert the flares off in say the direction of say Mercury providing it's not in direct alignment with the Earth
<br /><br />Who to deliver it, but captain Tim Matheson and his crew
That is if he can keep his mind on the business at hand and not on runaway son, Corin Nemec
Taking care of the personal side of the family problems is admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson's father, and Nemec's grandfather
<br /><br />There's a villain here too, Peter Boyle who is the CEO of a multi-national corporation which in this crisis is trying to control the world's food supply for the survivors
The idea he might not survive doesn't enter into his thinking
He's doing his best to sabotage Matheson's mission
<br /><br />Solar Crisis seems like a bad mix of 2001, A Space Odyssey and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea
Boyle seems to be taking his cue from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman, apparently he's the only one in the cast who realizes he's in a turkey and overacts accordingly
<br /><br />The rest of the cast are stalwart, true blue and dull
Except possibly desert rat Jack Palance who finds Nemec and cares for him
<br /><br />The key here is that the film was directed by that noted Hollywood purveyor of flop films, Allen Smithee
The film gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it was out in time for a Thanksgiving carving
Bela Lugosi is not typecast in this fantastic twelve-part adventure serial, playing the lead as Frank Chandler/Chandu the Magician, enjoying his role as a representative of the forces of White Magic pushed against those of Black, while displaying vigourous fighting skill, successfully wooing a young Egyptian princess, and cutting a lean and dashing figure in yachting gear, complete with nautical cap
The somewhat lumpy plot engages Chandler/Chandu in an ongoing series of escapades pointed at achieving the rescue of his fiancee, Princess Nadji(Maria Alba) and others from the clutches of the idol-worshipping sect of Ubasti, which covets Nadji's blood in order to revivify an ancient mummified princess entombed upon the mysterious island of Lemuria
Director Ray Taylor, an old hand at such entertainments keeps events moving briskly, but repeated scenes and footage, a good deal of which is to be found in the previous year's Skull Island setting from KING KONG, and the port locale from SON OF KONG, reduces original action to less than 60 minutes from the serial's running length of over two and one-half hours and, if viewed at one sitting, becomes lacking in effect to most viewers, unless insomniac
I saw this director's "Woman On The Beach" and could not understand the good to great reviews
This film is much like that one, two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else
Like his other films, you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog, wade through very little and become enchanted with underwritten, pretty uninteresting characters
If you feel you can like this film, don't let my review stop you
I do like minimalism in films, but I feel Tsai Ming-Liang's films are far superior
He has a fairly terrific actor in Lee Kang-Sheng in his films
"The Hazing" is one of them films I always wanted to see solely based on the illustrated cover image here on IMDb
Yes, that's how shallow I am! I don't care if ten million people call it a crap movie, the poster looks awesome so I guess I'll just have to see it  Now, "The Hazing" can somewhat be described like its alternate title: curious! The poster and title make it sound like a genuine horror movie set on campus and dealing with sinister initiation rites, but this movie is actually more of a crossbreed between comedy and thriller
First of all, there's something very wrong with the tagline on the old VHS box I watched
It says: He had good grades, a good girl and good buddies  until they put him through the Hazing"
Protagonist Gilbert Lewis is finally accepted by an acclaimed campus through an athletics scholarship
It takes over half the movie before we even hear about his girlfriend back home and the only "buddy" he has is a very nerdy Charles Martin Smith (still with hair in this film)
Both of them are approached to become members of the prestigious "Delts" fraternity, but during their hazing exam  in which they have to descend a mountain dressed in their tidy white undies  Barney falls off a cliff and breaks his leg
When Lewis returns with the other frat boys, Barney froze to death already
Together they intended to keep the body frozen for five days and then claim he never returned from a weekend ski-trip
With Barney's body hidden in the cafeteria freezer, Lewis has to cover for him so that Barney's absence doesn't look suspicious
The set-up of "The Hazing" is quite original and potentially innovative, but the problem here is that the execution could easily have been a lot better
The tone is too steady and too serious for a comedy movie, even a black one, but on the other hand there aren't any proper attempts to build up suspense or thrills, neither
The soundtrack is cheerful and full of light-headed tunes, but that's nearly not enough to make this film a comedy
Around an hour into the film, the plot also runs out of steam and idea, and the makers have no better alternative to fill up the emptiness with romantic compilations of Lewis and his outer town girlfriend biking through the countryside
I didn't like the final twist, because it's quite implausible and because it has been done numerous times before and after (though admittedly after)
"The Hazing" is not a complete waste of time, but still I'm glad I found an ex-rental tape at a friend's house instead of having to spend any money on the recently released DVD
Any time a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it simply doesn't bother with an actual story, it's annoying
Those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first, and the story simply tacked on
For this reason we often talk of the story "jumping through hoops" as it twists about, trying in vain to progress to the preordained ending in a logical fashion
<br /><br />The story in "Comet Over Broadway" doesn't just jump through hoops, it's a three ring circus
It's so ludicrous, so ill-conceived, so disingenuous that, if you are prone to speaking aloud to the screen, you will be carrying on quite a rant before it's through
<br /><br />The central theme of this screenplay cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession
Since it's all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion
So, in the end there's no point to the story, the theme becomes irrelevant and, as is often the case with poor screenplays, the acting doesn't save a thing
I watched the entire movie recognizing the participation of William Hurt, Natascha McElhone, and Desiree Nosbusch
I'm glad that I had no idea of the presence of Peter Weller
At the end of the movie I said "THAT was Peter Weller?" Kudos to Mr
Weller played a major character, and his performance was such that I didn't even recognize him
<br /><br />Overall the plot was bad, the writing was bad, and the performances, aside from those of Nosbusch and Weller, were subpar
The scenery and setting were interesting, and Weller was amazing
Maria Bello doesn't seem to care what people think of her choices in movie roles
Again she chooses a very difficult and not popular movie to star in
Maybe she needs those movies, to get off the sugar coated (aka "Hollywood") ones she does here and then (Coyote Ugly and of course Mummy 3)
<br /><br />While I think fails to achieve what it sets out to do (I won't spoil that), Maria Bello is as great as in her other independent/small movies she stars in
It's her performance that elevates this movie
This combined with the strange subject matter almost did the trick for me
But in the end (and even if I try to overlook some flaws, like bad pacing and dramaturgy), the movie is still too lon
A group of models is seeking an apartment to live in, and are shown one by a local real estate agent
Unknown to the models and the agent, however, is that "hell's threshold" is in the apartment and when crossed, the demon "Dethman" is summoned to kill all those in his path
The story is told by Sam Bishop, a journalist who was accused of the murders
<br /><br />Although I am a champion of low budget, microbudget, and independent films, I cannot praise this movie
The creators take pride in their 24-hour shooting schedule and at least one actor boasts on the DVD of his acting prowess, but I cannot wrap my head around this
Why make a film in 24 hours if an extra one or two hours of editing would make all the difference? And why pride yourself on acting that is poor, nonsensical and results in the bad delivery of a handful of lines?<br /><br />Through much of the film, the models are being shown parts of an apartment by a real estate agent
The dialog is clearly ad-libbed because no scriptwriter could come up with such empty diction
The agent, also, clearly knows nothing about housing
she focuses on aspects of a home that no one could care about, incorrectly explains the heat source (didn't she see the radiator?) and says the vermin problem will be solved when they call "the terminator"
Please, write a script -- some deviation is fine, but this was a mess
<br /><br />And why were the girls moving in models? Their careers had no point in the plot, and this seems like a forced situation
At one point, an actress breaks character and says something to the effect of "dude, they're going to be (upset)" which sounded more natural than any other line, though out of place because of the other bad dialog
I appreciated the attempt to explain how "hell's threshold" jumps to random places on Earth (including apartment fireplaces), but why not explain where the demon came from? His background involves a man whose love is killed by another man
How does this make you a demon? (Also, why did we need all these Victorian flashbacks with no dialog and glances across a field? It was overdone
)<br /><br />The dramatic pauses between lines was awful
The Sam Bishop character was by far the worst, with the interviewer not far behind
Does every question require a pause, a funny face and a response
followed by a pause, a funny face and a response? I was so frustrated
To me, the only point was to drag the time out
but I'd rather have thirty minutes of good delivery than an hour of horrible delivery (and then more time is wasted by rolling through the same credits twice)
<br /><br />Who was the Sam Bishop character, anyway? Allegedly he "saw" all this and was accused of killing the girls, but yet at no point was he ever in the part of the tale with the girls
So how did he see them? And if he didn't, how did he know Dethman killed them? And if he didn't see Dethman, how does he know Dethman is the spirit of Apostoles? I was so lost
was there even an outline for a plot when this was written? <br /><br />The only part I found enjoyable in this movie was a scene with one of the models in the bathroom
Not that it was really important or anything, but it was the only break from boredom I was given
I wonder what director Felix Diaz was thinking
His music is very good (see the DVD behind the scenes for his impromptu playing), but I wonder about his movie making skills
Although, by far the best part of the DVD was the trailer for his "Superhero Excelsior" (the trailer alone was better than this entire waste of time)
<br /><br />I am sorry I have to be so harsh
I'd like to think that this movie was a test of what can be done in 24 hours or maybe just an experiment for fun and the idea was never to make a quality film
But if "Superhero Excelsior" is any indication, Diaz can make quality
so why did he choose to avoid that here? Perhaps the world will never know
Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn would roll over in their graves if they knew this Guess Who's Coming to Dinner Rip Off was actually in theaters
Along with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with Director Stanley Kramer's 1967 master piece
So a white guy from an overly stereotyped Italian family in Rhode Island brings his African American girlfriend home (Insert GASP here) to his grand father's funeral
His family members reactions were of course
This movie was so painfully telegraphed from start to finish my girlfriend actually started fake snoring to signal to me that she wanted to leave
Do yourself a favor and rent the original
Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth
Roth and Randy Pearlstein co wrote the script from a story by Roth
this a zombie film,which owes a lot to George Romero and his earlier "living dead movies",and to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot to mention Sam Ramie's "Evil Dead"
there is nothing original here,and the story is not compelling
the acting is about par with this genre,it's just that the story fails
we have pretty much seen this movie before and better made
having said that,after having achieved commercial, if not artistic success from this movie,Roth decided he was a director and came out with the abysmally atrocious,mean spirited,pointless(though much more ambitious)crap fest Hostel
Roth should have quit while he was behind
Cabin Fever is not a good film,however compared to Hostel it is a work of art
I hope somebody (preferably a psychiatrist)convinces this guy that film-making is the wrong career choice
as for Cabin fever,a weak 3/10 for not being as abysmal as Hostel
Life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurrent theme both in modern literature and for film makers
Such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for; but to be effective they must also be entertaining
Unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read; whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round
The first such work to become really widely known was probably George Orwell's "1984" (first published in 1948), and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a film
<br /><br />Watch or read it: and then, when you are feeling a little depressed by man's inhumanity to man, reach for Cinderella 2000
This is a feather light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides effortless but unrewarding viewing; and as with 1984 the calendar has now passed beyond its erstwhile period
Most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments
To exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new extension of life by being released as a DVD or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies deteriorate past redemption
There are many worse films appearing as DVD's these days, and frankly I do not care much what happens either way
<br /><br />So far the best of the films of this genre has probably been "The Handmaiden's Tale", but I would very happily swap them all for a well made film of Jack London's towering novel "The Iron Heel"
Ambitious as this would be, it still seems incredible that no modern film maker has yet dared to attempt it (IMDb only lists a B/W silent version made in Russia in 1919)
The film started out pretty well, but after the 30 min mark i caught myself watching the clock
The horror at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in
It just got stupider and stupider as time ticked by
<br /><br />The actors gave an average performance in this movie however, i got a bit bored of Vinny Jones constant scowling in the film
<br /><br />As the film dragged on, and take my word for it, it dragged on, it just got more and more far fetched
<br /><br />*** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** Just when i thought the film could not get any worse, towards the end loads if skeleton looking monsters turned up, just to eat the dead people which made no sense at all
It turned out to be some sort of flesh eating cult and the good guys die at the end
The ending in fact just made me laugh at how bad it was
Once the lead role disposes of Vinny Jones, he becomes the new killer
<br /><br />In closing, this film made Creep look like the best horror film ever made
I gave it 1 star because the female lead did a pretty good job but even she could not save this train wreck of a movie!
The subject matter seems pretty dated today
Adapted for TV from Rona Jaffe's book; we trip and stumble through a fantasy existence
Four college students get deeply involved playing a live version of the board game Mazes and Dragons (based on Dungeons and Dragons)
One player, a young Tom Hanks, enters the fantasy world too deep
His co-players must come to his rescue and save him from self inflicted harm
<br /><br />David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace round out the game's foursome
Support cast is made up of veteran actors like Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg
<br /><br />At this date, it seems lumbering and tame
But the highlight of watching is seeing Tom Hanks between his "Bosom Buddies" salad days and his big splash in SPLASH on the silver screen
The youngest of viewer will get most enjoyment
Under the guise of a marathon race, we see depictions of extreme animal abuse, including literally running a horse to death IN SLOW MOTION
The guy who did this then has his conscience spiritually cleansed by the flames from the burial/burning of the horse, which of course is still dead, having been tortured to death
This is one of the sickest, slimiest movies I've ever had the displeasure of viewing
As Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the finish line on their DYING animals, we're supposed to admire their spirit for finishing the race
I'd like to put the producers and director in a marathon race; I'll decide when they're finished, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing
Why anyone thinks this is a good film let alone funny is a true mystery
I like comedies as much as the next man and I LOVED "A Christmas Story
" The fact that it has the same director and was based on the same writer's memoirs has me completely puzzled as to why this film is such a complete failure on every level
Charles Grodin is woefully miscast as the father for starters
For another it does not seem to have the same pacing -- it just doesn't flow well
The joy of life that permeated the first film is completely absent here -- you just want the movie to end
I wouldn't even recommend this movie for curiosity-seekers who enjoyed "A Christmas Story
The BFG is one of Roald Dahl's most cherished books, but in this animated adaptation the magic just isn't there
This version remains pretty faithful to Dahl's original story so one can't lay the blame on John Hambley's script
If anything the fault lies with the colourless animation, the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voice-overs
One would be right to expect this story to make for a happy, vibrant, fun-filled movie
instead, the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch
Children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first! All the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a children's' classic
<br /><br />Young orphan Sophie (voice of Amanda Root) lives in a none-too-friendly orphanage under the cruel supervision of Mrs Clonkers
One evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street
The figure realises it has been seen, so it reaches in through the window and scoops Sophie from her bed, placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night
Sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from Giant Country, and fears that he will eat her
But to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the BFG (voice of David Jason)
The BFG refuses to eat people, instead restricting himself to foul-tasting vegetables known as snozzcumbers
However, Giant Country is populated by numerous other giants who DO feast - every night, as it happens - on poor unsuspecting humans
Sophie and the BFG become great friends, and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants
Together they go to the Queen of England (voice of Angela Thorne) with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the man-eating giants
The Queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else
<br /><br />Jason voices the BFG quite well (one of the few pluses in the film) but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality
The rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired, with very little to bring the characters to life
Similarly, the BFG is the only character that is imaginatively animated - Sophie lacks appeal, and the giants are boringly designed (and look almost indistinguishable from each other)
Even the places are uninventive; Giant Country especially comes up short, being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons
At 88 minutes the film is not exactly lengthy, yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences
Little of Dahl's mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily
One chapter in the book deals with the BFG's love of "whizzpopping" (farting) and is laugh-out-loud hilarious
In the film, the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling
I came to the The BFG expecting lots of zest, fun and enjoyment, but what I got was pretty much the opposite! This one is a failed misfire that simply doesn't match the calibre of the book in any department - unfortunately, therefore, it must go down as one to skip
Prior to this film, I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi: the trashy zombie flick Le Notti del Terrore (1981), famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man-child Peter Bark, and the enjoyably sleazy giallo Strip Nude For Your Killer
Neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema, but both were entertaining in their own special way (and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didn't hurt)
Massacre, however, is dull, dull, dull, despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare flesh
<br /><br />The story, about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot, is confusing and oh-so boring: when the blood isn't flowing and the skin isn't on show, the film is a real struggle to sit through (it took me four attempts to finish), with endless scenes of unlikeable characters bickering among themselves and doing very little of note
<br /><br />The only point of interest about the film is that its producer, Lucio Fulci, used several of its death scenes to pad out his mega-gory movie Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert)
And if you've already seen that film, then there is very little reason to bother with Massacre
Lame, cliched superhero action movie drivel
I had high hopes for this movie, and the genre of HK buddy cop actioneers is one that i don't despise, but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous as this one was
This would have been forgivable, as it always is in these kinds of movies, when the action compensates, unfortunately, it did not
The action does carry the trademark surreality and over the top nature of HK action, but it's not very involving, obscenely gory, and in fact often completely incoherent (perhaps this is due to re-editing for american release, it does show signs in many places of patchwork)
I rented this movie on the merits of what the trailer showed, and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins
<br /><br />If Jackson Pollack teamed up with David Lynch, and Timothy Leary to make a movie, this would be the end result
I don't think I've seen a movie like it that made an LSD trip look like an episode of Sesame Street
<br /><br />It's a bunch of set pieces where the characters flash in and out of reality, or various realities, and the film doesn't culminate into anything until the last 5 minutes, where all of a sudden it makes sense
I wrote a scathing review on my movie review blog that essentially gives everything away, and I won't do that here
It's a well acted piece of cinema, and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, and let me say this, if there's one redeeming feature to this film, it's the music
Some of the dialogue is unbelievably good, and unbelievably bad all at the same time
<br /><br />I enjoyed parts of this movie, I truly did, and once you get to the end of it, you'll actually figure out what's truly going on
It's unfortunate that you have to wade through 2 hours of crazy to get to a salient point, which minimizes the effect of the entire movie
<br /><br />I give it a 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this film isn't the acting, it's everything
It isn't even so bad that it's good in an unintentional way
This film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry
It's as if the people who made this just took all of the really annoying stuff about the movie PRIEST, added in a bunch of ugly dudes, took out anything interesting, funny, or even remotely sexy and clever out of the concoction, and then added in a bunch of old rotten cheese
There isn't a single person this film could possibly connect to
There isn't any universe this film could possibly take place in
Why can't a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy? Why did they have to make this already stupid idea for a film even more ridiculous than it already is? Why couldn't they at least even tried to make it an okay film, or even a B-movie
Now that I think of it, what they hell were they trying to do with this film? I watched it expecting a campy love story and instead I got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying Christian brother tried to destroy it all!!! No, I'm not joking
Does that sound good? This film is pretty ignorant against people of the Christan religion, with it's stereotyping of all Christians being loudmouthed, rude, and hellbent on making as many people as miserable as possible
A lot of Christian people I know would never speak or act like these freaks
The film, however, is just as unfair and ignorant to the gay community as well
These have got to be the most tastelessly crafted stereotypical gay men since the guy on the radio station on that ROADKILL video game
It's so nerve wracking and simply irritating to the point that I wasn't able to fully pay attention to this film
The makers of this train-wreck had no strategy for set design, acting, camera angles, lighting, script, authenticity, or an idea to make this entertaining or interesting
There isn't even a single sex scene, or at least not a believable one
Jamie Brett Gabel was the only guy in the film that looked any good at all, but his good looks were sadly put to waste
In a perfect world, this film would get voted a 0
A mentally handicapped nun who is blind, deaf, and has tiny little bones for arms and legs and whose face is located on her armpit could write, direct, and produce a better film, and she'd probably be a better actor as well
the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word "film" itself
This film is so bad that other films should be ashamed of being available in the same watchable format
I could put a broom in a chair and then record it with a camera and then stop the film and then replace it with a mini x-mas tree and then record that and I've already made a film that will always be better than BEN & ARTHUR by at least half
There are only two things worse than death
I'm a homosexual and I will probably be the gayest person you will ever meet if you ever met me, and I don't think I've ever been more offended by an entire film than I was by the first five seconds of this film alone
If this movie was a mistake, I will personally find a way to change the famous phrase "It's okay to make mistakes" to "It's okay to make mistakes unless that mistake was BEN & ARTHUR
" You know how people always say things like, "Good things come out of everything!"? I think that BEN & ARTHUR was primarily invented so that there could be something on this earth that nothing good would ever come out of
To call this movie the worst movie I've ever seen would be giving it WAY too much credit
It's as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of it's very own
There are good movies, there are bad movies, and then there's BEN & ARTHUR
Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life
This is the movie which caused his downfall
It was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors
Rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred
Soon after its release, he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably
Its a very bad movie with horrible acting, bad-quality makeup and pathetic screenplay
Throughout the movie, Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease
I'm one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba, first day first show in theatre
The audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission
Sorry, I'll not recommend this one to anyone
Here's a horror version of PRISCILLA: QUEEN OF THE DESERT (they wish!) starring Melinda/Mindy (RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 3) Clarke as Candy, a desert dweller who pulls off a bank heist with boyfriend Johnny (Jason Durr)
He ends up in a South-of-the-border prison run by the sadistic Chief Screw (an overacting Robert Englund in a toupee)
She and her beloved pet poodles end up in hiding at a gas station convent until they're transformed by a newly fallen meteor
The dogs turn into obnoxious drag queen "bitches" and Candy develops a VERY long, talking, killing forked tongue she can't control
Thugs looking for the stolen loot and other assorted numbskulls add extra complications
<br /><br />First off, Clarke is fantastic and makes what there is to make of this movie
You watch her and see someone very funny during the slapstick scenes, very convincing during the horror scenes and VERY sexy in various wigs and disguises, including an eye-popping, skin tight latex bodysuit
and wonder how come this actress isn't a huge star
It's too bad the rest of this cult attempt doesn't live up to her promise
<br /><br />Blame director/scripter Sciamma, who thinks the outlandish premise alone is enough to sustain laughs
but his vulgar gags, annoying supporting characters and stupid dialogue are no substitute for a real sense of humor
Another nail in the coffin; the film looks cheap, lots of garish colors and sets are strangely muted by muddy photography and the dusty desert locales
Luckily for Sciamma that Clarke is in his film, because she alone keeps you watching
I don't even know where to begin but I hope I can save another person from punishing themselves with this movie
When it comes to acting and lighting, this movie is similar to a bad porno without the sex
The actors are some of the worst I've ever seen, and couldn't have been worse even if they were trying to make a complete mockery of this movie
The movie must have had a record breaking low budget which I'm sure was wasted almost solely on the movie's cover
This movie has now become a running joke with friends of mine and has become the standard for comparing other garbage movies
I would like to point of that no other movie even begins to compare
I feel personally responsible for suggesting a friend and me watch this movie and am surprised she still considers me a friend after the torment I put us through
My sincere advice to all: don't watch the movie
<br /><br />Don't even go near to the theater where this movie is being played!! even a glimpse of it is bad for health
and i returned from this crappiest movie on this universe
FOUR HOURS DAMN!!! I am proud that i survived after all of it! If this is called survival
it was sheer waste of time! money went in drain! no plot
Hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night!! RUBBISH MOVIE

SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS / (2000) ** (out of four)<br /><br />If you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional Dr
" If you are old enough to read this review, then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture
It contains lots of colors, creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction, joyous load noises, and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village Whoville
Unfortunately that is where the movie's positive elements end; the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for Jim Carrey to cackle on screen while giving a devilish grin, all while prancing through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much to do
<br /><br />Many people recognize the story of how the grinch stole Christmas from Whoville, so I will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read
However, I will say that the movie's story is executed in three major acts; the development of the grinch and setting, the Whoville festival, and the Dr
Seuss vision of the mean one robbing the Who's from their Christmas
There are many familiar names within the credits here, but no familiar faces
Like in "Battlefield Earth," I just do not see why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities shielded by unrecognizable makeup and costumes
Regardless, there is SNL's Molly Shannon as Betty Lou, the wife of Bill Irwin, the later playing Lou Lou, the father of little Cindy Lou, played by Taylor Momsen
Jeffrey Tambor is the Whoville mayor, Anthony Hopkins lends his bellowing voice for the film's narrator, and Christine Baranski is the Grinch's lone lost lover
<br /><br />The filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little Cindy Lou
The screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S
Seaman just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape; there is little if any focus by director Ron Howard and the screenplay is predictable, too extensive, and contrived
The only character given any distinctions here is the Grinch himself, all of the other characters are puppets of the plot, shapeless and uninteresting
And the dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic
Example-Grinch: Oh, the Who-manity!<br /><br />The movie's redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer Michael Corenblith, the costume designer Rita Ryack, and the ample makeup department
"How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a very good-looking production
The sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative; it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream
The people of Whoville are plastered with makeup, to the point in which we cannot tell the actor reciting the humorless lines
Although dazzling, I really can't give credit to the performances, for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their place
<br /><br />Jim Carrey is one actor who I can talk about
His performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself He is way too egotistic as the Grinch, too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of Seuss
Surprisingly, although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences, no laughs come from Jim Carry's zany silliness
It is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for Carry to overplay his part
This factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy, which is only a pale shadow of the original Christmas classic "How the Grinch Stole Christmas
"<br /><br />After this movie, historians should check the coffin of the late author, Dr
Perhaps the worst thing about Carlos Mencia's comedy is that every joke needs to be followed with an insult at the people in the crowd that aren't laughing
If there's anybody who's insecure, it's a comedian who won't shut up about his audience
<br /><br />Then again, perhaps the worst thing about Carlos Mencia's comedy is that he doesn't get off his free speech high horse
If you want to be funny, just make a joke, don't explain all the reasons why you're saving the American way with your failed attempts at generating laughter
the worst thing about Carlos Mencia's comedy is that it substitues meanspirited jabs at ethnicities for legitimate humor
Gadar is a really dumb movie because it tells a fake story
It's too unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol movie that is aimed to bash Pakistan

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1
78:1<br /><br />Sound format: Stereo<br /><br />In late 19th century England, young Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) is sent to the public school at Rugby where he experiences the reforms of a radical new headmaster (Stephen Fry) and stands up to the school's resident bully, Flashman (Joseph Beattie)
<br /><br />Already the subject of numerous screen adaptations - most notably Gordon Parry's superior 1951 version - Thomas Hughes' evergreen novel gets the early 21st century treatment, courtesy of screenwriter Ashley Pharoah (TV's "Where the Heart Is") and director David Moore (THE FORSYTE SAGA)
It's pleasant enough, and watchable, but it's also rather staid and dull, distinguished only by Fry's sincere performance as the new principal determined to sweep away some of the school's most dubious 'traditions', and by the introduction of a possible new star in 14 year old Pettyfer, a talented kid with the kind of effortless charm and vivid good looks that should take him all the way to Hollywood and beyond
Otherwise, this is typical UK TV fodder, the kind of stuff favored by executives eager to fill the schedules with 'prestige' product, even one as thoroughly unremarkable as this
The UK publication 'Radio Times' described it as "daintily odd" and raised a querulous eyebrow over "all of that fagging and brutality and a handsome, rakish villain torturing the life out of sweet young boys"
Marlon Brando had long since lost interest in acting when he made this film
His performance as "The Swede" is the worst of his career, and that is precisely what he intended it to be
Instead, he simply acts in a bizarre fashion and pokes fun at his embarrassingly gargantuan girth
The scene where Brando climbs over the toilet stall is probably the worst, funniest moment in the history of cinema
As we witness him fall head-first into a toilet, it is hard to believe that we are watching the same actor who starred in A Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, and The Godfather
<br /><br />I guess the real question is why Marlon behaved like this in his later years
Was he sick of the movie business? Did he just like making a complete and utter fool out of himself? I guess we'll never know
But this film serves as a fascinating study as to what bad acting is all about
<br /><br />On that note, watch fellow acting veteran Donald Sutherland as he struggles to deliver his lines, embarrassed at himself for agreeing to participate in this travesty
If you ask me the first one was really better one
, she is real, mean, cruel girl, look at Amy Adams she is just little fool hanging around
She is nothing! People don't adore her! Second, Sebastian was cute and hot in first movie, now he is "baby face"
Story is not that good, and i do not understand
Why didn't they make this one first, it is the beginning
First one has better actors, better story, and its mean
I think that the music is better in cruel intentions 1 and the music is better in cruel intentions 3
It is not the worst movie I saw, but in compaer with first one its one big, big, big nothing
This superior inferiority to the original dumb "Blind Dead" movie is another trash bin waste
So many people have hyped up these films that I can't believe what they say about it
Since I was a kid I have heard about how scary and great these films are and I saw them all and was throughly disappointed, was everyone on drugs, from the 1970's or do they just not know how boring this crude is
It was possibly the worst movie I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through
I cannot fathom how it ranks a rating of 5 or 6
It certainly didn't kill me during its hour and a half duration, but it didn't impress me much either
A group of kids are abducted in an alley by musclehead mutants (in a scene featuring cinema's least convincing head crushing sound effect) and taken to a fancy house in the suburbs
Divine and his team are performing brain transplants for his rich old patients so they can have young bodies again
Hey, this was quietly remade with a big budget a few years later as FREEJACK! Who knew that when you transplant an old person's brain into a different body that their new voice will sound exactly like their old voice? With all this talk of pineal glands and the use of a glowing green serum, you can almost see visions of FROM BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR dancing in the producers' heads
But the production literally doesn't have the guts to pull it off
I've never understood why, when someone is making a low budget horror film, that they don't pack it to the edge of the frame with gore
The acting is uniformly terrible, with the only good performance coming from Clarke Lindsley as the assistant Dr
The only other thing of note about THE IMMORTALIZER is that it features lots of old people doing their own stunts
Seriously, most of the cast takes some serious bumps for old folks
I suppose all the inside jokes is what made Munchies a cult classic
I thought it was awful, though given the ridiculous story and the nature of the characters, it probably could've been a much better (and funnier) movie
<br /><br />Munchies, as many viewers have pointed out already, is something of a Gremlins parody
The movie begins somewhere in Peru during an archeological dig
An annoying dufus named Paul, aspiring stand up comedian who offers no sarcasm or witty jokes during the movie despite his career plans, is holed up with his dad in the caves
His dad is an unconventional kind of archeologist, searching the caves not for artificats or mummies or anything, but proof of U
And that's where the Munchies come into the picture
Hidden in the crevice of a rock is an ugly little mutant that looks like a gyrating rubber doll with a Gizmo voice
They name him Arnold, stash him in a bag, and bring him home so Paul's dad can finally show proof of extra terrestrial life
<br /><br />Paul, the idiot that he is, breaks his promise to his dad to watch Arnold (a wager he made with his dad, if he loses, it's off to community college to get a 'real' career)
The creepy next door neighbor with the bad rug, Cecil (television veteran Harvey Korman), wonders what his neighbors are up to
So, he and his lazy son, some airhead hippie type (who looks more like they should've made his character a biker or heavy metal enthusiast) to go and snatch Arnold
And of course, even Cecil's son is too dumb to look after Arnold
And after a few pokes and prods at Arnold, he multiplies into more Munchies
<br /><br />This wasn't even a movie that was so bad it was good
I was hoping that the Munchies would've mutated and killed the morons that were always after them, even Paul and his girlfriend
At least it would be one way to get rid of all the bad acting in this movie that really hams up the movie
Not to mention poor special effects that look like hand puppets
And really bad writing all around--it wasn't even funny--not even that young cop who can really give you the homicidal twitch in your eye
Like I said, Munchies, if they had been given an actual budget and better actors, they might've been able to pull off a good parody
I don't know what it is with these Brady kids
First, Barry Williams publicly brags about having sexy with his TV sister, Maureen McCormick, then about dating his TV mom, Florence Hederson
Then, Susan (Cindy) Olsen does music for a bunch of porno movies
Then Mike (Bobby) Lookinland gets in trouble for drunk driving
Finally, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eve (Jan) Plum might have had a little same-sex fling on the side
Now, Christopher (Peter) Knight is pursued by a beautiful young model in her early-20s during his stint on "The Surreal Life", which at first was fun to watch, and now they are married and in a very volatile and hostile relationship
The last episode, where she posed for a bunch of nude photographs with another naked girl for a scrapbook to give to Christopher for his birthday, was not a good move on her part
And he dealt with it in a very mature fashion, just picking up and leaving to clear his head
I think he was always bowing to her every need and now he's finally taking a stand
And I hate to say it, but I think she abuses him, verbally
The way she was torturing him for an engagement ring and the way she reams him for every little thing
Also she talks openly about having flings with other women and it is obvious she still sleeps around on him with women and men, which is not something any self-respecting human being should do when already married to someone
If this were a man talking down to his wife like that, and going out every night partying and having sex with other people, everyone would be rallying behind the wife to leave him
What started out as a cute little crush on another reality show blossomed into a huge disaster
Adrianne, as beautiful as she is, is like another Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, clearly in need of some therapy because she cries like a baby over so many silly things
I feel sorry for her, but Chris needs to rid himself of her, because he is a good man who cannot afford to be humiliated like this
I was in physical pain watching the eyes of the cast as they participated in this sham
Bad dialogue, worse (worst) acting, lifeless all the way, and the cast knew it
The two preceding movies which this attempted to copy had life, sparkle, and were captivating
Goodgfellas it isn't but its one of the better crime films done
This movie should be considered closer to THE STING Part2 or maybe speed Zone
Remember those gems! The only reason this movie was made was to capitalize on the cult following of the original
This movie lacked everything De Palma, Pacino and Penn worked so hard on
There wasn't a likable character and that is the fault of everyone responsible for making it
I hope RISE TO POWER wins every RAZZIE it possibly can and maybe even invent some new categories to allow it be a record holder
After I watched this S@*T FEST movie, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get th bad taste out of my mouth
After watching this I wish Pachanga came and whacked me out of my misery
The "math" aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this TV show apart from the millions of other cop shows
The only redeeming aspect to this show is Rob Morrow, although his career must have been (undeservedly) waning after Northern Exposure if he signed up for this schlock
<br /><br />The lame-ness of the "math" aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co-starring Lou Diamond Phillips (which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned
) In order to catch a fugitive, the "mathematician" uses some theory about "bubbles"
So, he gives this long explanation that, if we have seen the suspect in places A, B and C, then we can use "bubble theory" to calculate where he might be
He does this all on a chalkboard, or maybe with a stick in the dirt (I cant remember)
<br /><br />Anyway, when you look at the finished product, he basically took three spots, and picked a point right in the middle and said "Ok, mathematically, here's where we are most likely to find the fugitive
" At which point, one other character points out "Oh, that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live
" Is that math? Its not even connect-the-f**k**g-dots!!! This show reminds me of the math major I used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to "support" points that every one else had already agreed on through either less-complex analysis or basic common sense
<br /><br />It just goes to show -- When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail
I can't wait til they stick the NUMB3RS team on OSAMA
They'll use calculus, call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains, and hit Osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields
This movie was like "The Disney Channel after Dark
" Take out the "aren't we naughty" language and themes and you are left with dialogue and plot devices that insult the intelligence of anyone who doesn't describe "Saved by the Bell" as quality television
The dialogue so laughably cliched and knowingly dirty, one might think the screenplay was the product of locking Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas in a room with orders to produce an amalgam of every bad script each had ever had a hand in creating
If that was Roger Kumble's intention, mission accomplished
There was nothing of value in the original movie, this one was even lamer
The fact that I even found it to rent was absolutely amazing
Anyone connected to this film has to be high on something! So what was the story line? What was with the girl? Was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film
Sadly, I tried several times to watch this
I even borrowed a kid from someone to get some feedback
Kid said it was stupid, and he was four years old
I find that possibly some credit could go to the filming director, as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a B film
Good thing it was only a dollar, it was worth it
I suppose you might enjoy the film if you were high as the cast and crew would have to be
This documentary is at its best when it is simply showing the ayurvedic healers' offices and treatment preparation
There is no denying the grinding poverty in India and desperation of even their wealthier clients
However, as an argument for ayurvedic medicine in general, this film fails miserably
Although Indian clients mention having seen "aleopathic" doctors, those doctors are not interviewed, and we have to take the vague statements of their patients at face value-- "the doctor said there was no cure," "the doctor said it was cancer" etc
Well, "no cure" doesn't mean "no treatment," and what type of cancer exactly does the patient have? The film is at its most feeble when showing ayurvedic practice in America
There it is reduced, apparently, to the stunning suggestion that having a high powered Wall Street job can make your stomach hurt
I am a Christian and I say this movie had terrible acting, unreal situations and a completely facade front for Christianity
You might as well watch "Remember the Titans" and at least not mix Christ in a football film like a formulaic steroid for losers
Let me make some really pressing comments of what bothered me in this film
The school was in Georgia and was a white academy school
I did not notice a single black student or player in the school
I deal with the White "Christian" Academies in the south and they were built for no other reason than to reestablish segregation
This is troubling when the movie is about Christianity and Christ changing lives
how about changing the hearts of segregation? (note: I loved the token black coach; like it made up for the entirely white team and all the black 'Giants' players
The uncritical acclaim by everyone Christian about this movie
Can I get a couple people to say that it was bad acting, bad filming, bad writing and in short poor compared to other movies
If we were to compare this to another football movie, would it have the same charisma and energy? <br /><br />3
The half-baked Christianity which was shown made even less sense to me than the unrealistic ending
If Christianity is about simply reading a little scripture and praying to begin a complete life change, then don't wonder when no one will listen to what Christians have to say
He doesn't need sold and He doesn't need to be attached to such whimsical lifestyles
No wonder everyone considers Christianity to be anti-intellectual with this unreal presentation
<br /><br />I recognize this film may be inspirational to a few people
It will not give a real picture of struggle and heartfelt tension
Most importantly to me, it is not Christian by any means or stretch
It has values but it falls short as a 'pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps' message as shallow as positive thinking
If you live alongside people who struggle and/or those in third world living conditions, this movie will be hollow as most churches are today in their religion
I saw Crispin Glover's "What Is It?" at the Ann Arbor film festival
Admittedly, the film was at least aptly named, because I got the distinct sense that even the writer/director could provide no answer
At the question and answer session after the screening, Mr
Glover said that the film was originally meant to be a short film to show the virtue of using actors with down-syndrome
However, this is in itself not enough of a reason to create a film
Actors are, in my opinion, building blocks for a larger vision - a larger vision that seemed muddled at best and absent at worst
<br /><br />Crispin Glover also said that he wanted to address taboo subjects
But why? The film seems to have no stance, no reason for addressing anything
Does he feel these things shouldn't be taboo? The film doesn't even give me an indicator of that
Taboo for the sake of taboo is not interesting
It can't even afford to make the taboo disturbing or inciting on any level because he hasn't made the audience care in any way
<br /><br />Ignoring problems with the concept for a moment, the thing that actually shocked me most was how poorly the film was put together
The editing, cinematography, and other technical aspects seemed frequently to be extremely amateur
Glover said 125-150 thousand dollars went into the movie, and I feel that the money should have been spent on different designers (Glover actually did some design himself - I know I saw at least sound design in the credits)
The painted sets are okay (not great), but used poorly
Parts feel like a photographed stage play - which would be fine if that went to any sort of purpose, but in Glover's hands it just feels sloppy
Other parts are filmed like a sort of Home Movie, of inferior quality to a lot of the stuff I see first-time filmmakers do on iMovie
<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest problem with "What Is It?" is I can't even understand how seriously the film is to be taken
There are some parts that feel like Glover is screaming at you to think seriously
At other points, he seems off on his own little joke
Perhaps he meant for this to be ironic, or meaningful in some way, but I just felt that Glover couldn't even get himself to give his film any sort of serious attention
<br /><br />Glover said he originally wanted it to be a short film
At seventy-two minutes, the film runs out of imagery and ideas in the first twenty, and it is arguable if the ideas were formulated enough to claim that they were even there for that period of time
me, my boyfriend, and our friend watched this "movie" if thats what u wanna call it, and we agree with the last person, but we were stupid and bought the damn thing, we thought it really was about diablo so we bought it
<br /><br />we hate it Really SUXZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so beware: DO NOT BUY THIS THING THEY CALL A MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />we would return it, but don't no if anybody would want this stupid movie
<br /><br />oh and another thing, the shouldn't call it "The Legend of Diablo" they should of called it "Legend of Azar"
<br /><br />and this movie is rated R????? this should not of even been not rated
<br /><br />we think that diablo would be crying his eyes out laughing at this stupid movie
<br /><br />this is a movie that would have been done by a Church
<br /><br />theses "actors" are never gonna become nothing because this movie
Just in time to capitalize on the long-awaited movie version of "Dreamgirls" is the DVD release of this semi-forgotten 1976 musical melodrama that also takes the rise of the Supremes as its inspiration
Released five years before the Broadway opening of "Dreamgirls" and partially set in the same period, it has a predominantly black cast and a story revolving around an up-and-coming girl group, and that's where the resemblance basically ends
Written by Joel Schumacher well before he became a big-league director of mainstream studio product ("Batman Forever", "The Phantom of the Opera"), this movie seems grittier on the surface
True to form, however, Schumacher weakens the storyline and character development by injecting an abundance of clichés and eye-rolling one-liners
With little affinity for staging musical numbers, Sam O'Steen, a highly regarded film editor but neophyte director, helms the production like a low-budget TV-movie with a frustratingly episodic structure
<br /><br />The story follows three Harlem sisters - sexy Sister, self-righteous Delores and sweet Sparkle - as they sing in the church choir, meet smooth-talking but well-intentioned boys Stix and Levi, and then find their first taste of success as a singing group - first as a sweater-wearing quintet called the Hearts and then as a glitzy trio known as Sister and the Sisters
But naturally there are problems beyond the silly name for the group - Sister gets involved with nasty drug dealer Satin Struthers who beats her and turns her into a cocaine junkie; Levi goes to prison for getting caught in a drug pick-up for Satin; Stix gets frustrated by failure and unwisely turns to some Jewish mobsters for financial help; Delores just gets plain fed up; and poor little Sparkle has to decide what kind of future she wants
A big plus is that R&B great Curtis Mayfield wrote the atmospheric songs, some catchy and one, "Look Into Your Heart", a real winner
<br /><br />The solid cast does its best under the contrived circumstances
Lonette McKee's valiant attempt to make Sister a tragic figure is undercut by some of the ham-fisted plot turns, including a sad Billie Holliday-like turn at the mike
Before they hit it big on primetime TV, Philip Michael Thomas and Dorian Harewood portray Stix and Levi with boyish vitality if not much credibility
The best work comes from Mary Alice in a relatively silent turn as the girls' patient mother and a pre-"Fame" Irene Cara who effortlessly exudes sincerity in the title role (though her costumer and hair stylist should be shot for the hideous look she achieves in the final scene)
The DVD just comes with the original theatrical trailer complete with an unctuous voice-over by DJ Casey Kasem and a bonus CD of five of the film's songs performed not by the original cast but by Aretha Franklin off her 1976 recording of the soundtrack
It's not a terrible movie, just an interesting if lacking curio that happens to cover the same ground as "Dreamgirls"
When I go out to the video store to rent a flick I usually trust IMDb's views on a film and, until this one, had never seen a flick rated 7
<br /><br />Sidney Lumet, a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century, really misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can: filling a film's cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoever
<br /><br />I like films with flawed characters, but no matter how dark someone's personality is we all have a bit of light in there too, we're all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others
Lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitch-black characters
<br /><br />Ethan Hawke's Hank is a 30-something whining, immature, irresponsible man-child divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks he's a loser, which he very much is
His indecisiveness and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he's too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed
By the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film, it's more pathetic than uplifting
Ethan Hawke plays his character well, but isn't given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face and he doesn't' particularly care that it's there
<br /><br />Speaking of which his character's wife is equally as bad
Just about every single shot of the film she's in is her verbally berating him for rent and child support money and further grinding in his already non-existent self-esteem with insults
Seriously, that's just about all the character does
Her harpy-like behavior borders on malevolent
<br /><br />Albert Finney plays their father Charles, and while Mr
Finney has been a great actor for many decades, he spends about 90% of this film with the same mouth open half-grimace on his face like he's suffering from the world's worst bout of constipation
For someone who's been an actor as long as Mr
Finney, you think he'd be more apt at emoting
Even though he doesn't show it much, his character is supposedly grief stricken and anger-filled
And when he smothers Andy at the film's conclusion it's akin to Dr
Frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of it's own misery
<br /><br />Marisa Tomei isn't given much to do with her character
Stuck in an unhappy marriage with Andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason
When Andy's world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship, but it really doesn't make her any less selfish or self-serving than any other character in the film, but probably the one with the most common sense at least
<br /><br />And finally we come to Andy, played by the always good Philip Seymour Hoffman, is the only reason I rated this film a 3 instead of a 1
His performance of the heroin-addicted, embezzling financial executive who's "perfect crime" of robbing his parent's insured jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing
His descent from calm master planner of a flawed scheme to unstable, deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic
Hoffman's character ends up being the film's chief villain, but it's hard to root against him given the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who's self-admitted poor early parenting led to his son's eventual psychosis and indirect, unintentional murder of his mother
<br /><br />Ultimately this film is really only worth watching for PSH's great performance and it's family train wreck nature
Just don't expect there to be any characters worth cheering for, because there really aren't
This film can't make up its mind whether its message is "humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless" or "don't ever go in the water again
" A fisherman (Nolan) is out to nab a killer whale, a very bad thing, but when he accidentally (ACCIDENTALLY mark you) hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate, the cow -- and I use the word in all senses -- who is obviously a sick psycho-bitch and the canonical villain of the piece -- throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself
) When her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous self-inflicted wounds, her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt, kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to Nolan
Obviously as among humans, total psychos date other total psychos
<br /><br />The film reeks of half-thought out anti-human message, "the poor poor whale!! the evil men must suffer and die!" and yet, it does not succeed in demonizing Nolan at all
It's true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel, but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and, as the film progresses, he grows more and more compassionate to the whale's pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale, just to make it feel a little better
<br /><br />The films final journey, in which Nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north, reminds me of Melville's eerie man-whale connection, and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion, where these two husbands might connect, understand even respect each other in their own grief, for Nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident
It's clear Nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss
The whale-character has no compassion or respect for anyone
<br /><br />The final scene loses this focus and becomes Jaws-like where the sea-monster finally kills everybody and Nolan and no-doubt through an oversight, fails to chomp up the whale-hugger (tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier
) I love animals, and I detest whaling, and what is more I love orca whales, but if this film's goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed
Nolan shows compassion and growth, and feels for others, and all the whale thinks about is killing and maiming
<br /><br />The only message one can walk away with is "If you see an orca whale, ever, anywhere, run the other way cause if you step on his FIN the wrong way, he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you
Hopelessly inept and dull movie in which the characters stand around in rooms or a rocket ship and talk endlessly
You might think things would perk up when they explore Mars but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red/orange filter which makes everything very murky
The Martian landscape/vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are entirely unconvincing
There are echoes of 'Bride Of The Monster' when the heroine carefully winds the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eating plant around her before weakly thrashing about, the difference being that the Ed Wood film is a hundred times more entertaining
Better wear earplugs when watching otherwise the 'sci-fi' music score, repeated endlessly, will drive you insane
If you find yourself unable to sleep one night just slip this one into the VCR and your insomnia will be cured in no time
Having just recently re-viewed "Lipstick" for the first time in a few decades, I backed it with "Descent" even though I have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine
<br /><br />It's interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the Rape Revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years, from the full-on gore of "I Spit On Your Grave," to the tawdry sensationalism of "Lipstick," to the tasteful handling of the issue in "The Accused
" But "Descent," though making some important points, never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning
No, "Descent" is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make --- a message that, when examined closely, isn't that groundbreaking
<br /><br />I pretty much knew the plot going in
What I wanted to see *was* the "descent" or degeneration of Dawson's character
Being a big fan of Rosario's, I was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted
you know, the kind of portrayal DeNiro brings to "Taxi Driver
" Unfortunately, the script and the director/writer's choices don't provide any sort of believable transition
<br /><br />The biggest point of failure is the second act
It became obvious what the filmmaker's intentions were for this segment of club-hopping, drug use, and obsession with big black stallion Adrian (every white boy's nightmare, natch) from a Q&A on the DVD, but this excursion into Dawson's character is never believably rendered
We don't know exactly what the hell she's doing half the time, what she's after, or why she's doing it
The poor quality of the audio/video again don't help, but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless
It destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well-done first act
By the time we get to the finale, our interest has already waned
<br /><br />One point of success that Dawson does point out in the Q&A is that by the end "revenge" scene we are pumped for retribution, then realize just how drawn-out and ugly the reality is
While that's certainly valid, it doesn't make the scene any more intriguing
<br /><br />If you have the DVD, check out the deleted "classroom" scene
This is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation (though all verbal) and really DOES show Dawson's slow crack-up materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor Francie Swift's prissy, condescending dorm counselor
If more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down, we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence
<br /><br />As the film stands in the final cut, though, all we get is what we've seen before, only in a more graphic rendering
Dont let the MPAA fool you with their "Rated R for extreme violence" there is definatly no extreme violence in this boring peice of s*t
I expected some cheap rambo 3 type action that the trailer promised, however its just boring boring nonsense with tons of lame slow mo flashbacks that make no sense
"Rival reporters Pat Morgan (Ginger Rogers) and Ted Rand (Lyle Talbot) are always trying to out-scoop each other on stories
The latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment
The two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis
<br /><br />This said-to-be follow-up to "The Thirteenth Guest" has little to do with the earlier movie; it is not a sequel, as has been inferred
Talbot adds a little humor to his characterization
They are a pleasant team, the plot is interesting and mysterious; but, the resulting film is very dull
A long-winded wrap-up of plot development points follows the climax
<br /><br />*** A Shriek in the Night (1933) Albert Ray ~ Ginger Rogers, Lyle Talbot, Harvey Clar
This was a strange kind of film about a low-lifes in New York City and centering around a main character (the title name, played by Brad Pitt) who thinks he''s a Ricky Nelson-type musician, except he has no real talent
<br /><br />It's kind of fun to watch until a profane tough New York City-type woman with horrible accent enters the picture and takes over
It must have been Catherine Keener, who usually plays tough and garbage-mouthed women
<br /><br />The hairdo on Pitt - an exaggerated Pompadour - was fun to look at
I can picture Johnny Depp playing this role better
One last note: it odd to hear a film made in 1992 (other than Woody Allen's) with just mono sound
I am a Catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high school & college
I am still a practicing Catholic but would not be considered a "good Catholic" in the church's eyes because I don't believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me to
its bad because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead
There is no comedy in that and the satire is not done well by the over acting of Diane Keaton
I never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be good
<br /><br />At first I thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Mary's emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith
But it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedy
the tragedy of loss of life (besides the two former students
the lives of the aborted babies, the life of the student's mom), the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people, the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in God
This is what is wrong with today's Islam, and yesterday's Judaism and Christianity
Think of a no-budget version of China Syndrome being directed by a film student who idolizes John Woo and you'll get 'Power Play
' The idea was good, but the execution, acting, and dialog absolutely killed it, not to mention ridiculous amounts of violence and disaster sequences that was used to compensate for lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the movie
<br /><br />This is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the offices of a power plant that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of earthquake
The rather cavalier reporter, going up against what should've been a more ruthless bunch of company execs, is chased around town (along with anyone he speaks to) in order to "clean" whatever conclusive evidence might remain of the plant's faults
<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is no real sense of emergency because the characters interact with much hesitancy, coupled with idiotic dialog and a lot of horrible acting
Not to mention, the viewer, who may only be attracted to the movie for it's action genre appeal, is forced to endure a mounting body count and ridiculous amounts of violent shoot em-ups plus earthquake disaster scenes
All of the focus was put in the wrong place to apologetically compensate for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that should've propelled the story
It might've been much better had the filmmakers focused more on a thriller, and paid greater attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story
Creepy villains, a naive reporter, and those who attempt to alert the reporter of the wrong-doing afoot
It is formulaic, but at least it would've been entertaining
I get the feeling that those involved in making "Surviving Christmas" didn't put much thought into the movie
The characters are so inconsistent and the plot makes so little sense that the movie played like a rough draft of a script thrown together with little but the one-liner concept of a rich guy paying a family to let him spend Christmas with them
<br /><br />Ben Affleck portrays Drew Latham, the typical Hollywood image of a wealthy, egotistical advertising executive who buys his way through life
His girlfriend, Missy, leaves him shortly before Christmas because she's disgusted that Drew wanted to take her to Fiji for Christmas, which she calls "the family holiday," and the fact that Drew has never introduced her to his family
We later find out that Drew's father left when he was 4 years old, and his mother is dead, so it's a mystery why he doesn't just say that he has no family, rather than allow his girlfriend to believe that he doesn't care about his family
<br /><br />Out of fear of being alone on Christmas, Drew tracks down Missy's shrink (why? I have no idea), who suggests he do a forgiveness ritual at his childhood home
When he meets the family living in his childhood home, the Valcos, Drew offers them $250,000 to pretend to be his family, so he can relive his fond childhood memories
He gets angry when he later finds out that they have an adult daughter, Alicia (Christina Applegate), because he "doesn't have a sister," and even goes so far as to write a script for the family to follow so that they act more like his "real" family
None of this makes any sense once Drew reveals that he grew up with no family but his mother
<br /><br />Also inexplicable is the character of Alicia, who is annoyed that her family accepted Drew's money, and refuses to play along with his fantasy
But for no good reason, she suddenly starts to like Drew, and in a matter of minutes goes from hating his guts to acting like his girlfriend
Drew is such a complete jerk throughout the movie that even his sad story about the lonely Christmases of his childhood evokes no sympathy; I almost wish he had finished with, "Just kidding! The real reason I don't see my family is that they all have restraining orders against me!" (2/10
The film is about a sabretooth on the lose at a amusement park where teens are on a scavenger hunt
Since there are no rules they break into a building and start getting killed off
But at least it had better effects then sabretooth
I gave it a three because Stacy was in it and I loved the movie Sabretooth
I thought it was okay but some deaths were off-screen
There was a dumb scene where the two teens kiss and the sabretooth's head pops out and the boy leaves his girlfriend behind leaving her to have her totally fake looking red guts out
Then the sabretooth gets up in the vents and bites the kids head off
The end death with the owner was totally fake looking graphics
Even that death was stupid because the statues tooth went through his mouth and hangs there like that will support it and there is a scene when a goth girl loses her contacts doesn't find them, and seems like she doesn't need the
Tony Scott destroys anything that may have been interesting in Richard Kelly's clichéd, patchy, overwrought screenplay
Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model who dropped out and became a bounty hunter
<br /><br />The problem with this rubbish is that there isn't much of a story at all and Scott's extreme graphic stylization of every shot acts as a distancing mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything in Harvey's chaotic life
<br /><br />You just don't care about Harvey
Knightley plays her as an obnoxious, cynical brat who has done nothing to warrant our respect
She punches people she doesn't like and sheds her clothes and inhibitions when the situation calls for it, but she isn't the least bit real and Knightly isn't the least bit convincing, either
It's loud, too, and shackled with one of the most annoying source music scores I've heard in a long time
The final twenty minutes are a poor re-run of Scott's "True Romance" climax with Domino's gang going to meet two sets of feuding bad guys who are -- surprise! surprise! -- destined to shoot it out with each other at the top of a Las Vegas casino
<br /><br />Unfortunately, this potentially exciting conflagration is totally botched by Scott and becomes a confusing, pretentious, pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation
This is not an artistically brave or experimental piece; it is a failure on every level because it gives us no entry point to the lives and dilemmas of its characters
<br /><br />Mickey Roarke looks good as a grizzled bounty hunter, but he disappears into the background as the "narrative" progresses
Chris Walken turns in another embarrassing cameo and Dabney Coleman, always solid, is underutilized
<br /><br />Don't be fooled by this film's multi-layered, gimmick-ridden surface
It is still a turd no matter how hard you polish it
i had more fun watching the paint dry at my local hardware store on an august day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke
the acting got progressively worse as the "movie" advanced, and the directors use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached
when misty was shot to death she decided that it would be prudent to blink post mordem
truthfully, stevie wonder could have caught that with his eyes closed
if you are deciding between playing with a nail gun while intoxicated and watching this movie, bear in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends
It's pretty clear that the director and production crew set out to paint a less than flattering picture of the Palestinian girl and her family
The film and it's website tries to imply that Ayat has a secret reason for blowing herself and Rachel up- a boyfriend problem- perhaps pregnancy
Neatly glossed over is the fact that Ayat had herself just witnessed the death of a close friend at the hands of the Israelis'-just outside her home
Gosh,so why on earth would a young, pretty, intelligent girl with plans for college go and do such a thing? Could it be that the hormonal, emotional teenager was traumatized by seeing seeing someone she loved die before her very eyes? This detail merits all of 5 seconds in the movie
Another neatly sidestepped detail is that Avigail Levy, Rachels' mother, could have prevented the destruction of the building the Akhras family lived in(along with 22 other families)
One distinctly gets the impression that she's offering this as a "concession" - should Mrs
(since the movie was made the home has been destroyed- apparently the interview didn't result in what she wanted- so bring on the bulldozers)Mrs Levy claimed that she "wanted the movie to be cathartic as well as a symbol of hope, a chance to transcend entrenched hatreds"- instead she uses it as an excuse to harangue Ayats mother, while dangling the house as a carrot
Moreover although the two women live only 4 miles apart, she is so out of touch with the realities of the occupation for her Palestinian neighbors, that she really thinks that Mrs
Akhras can just drop over for a cup of coffee?Please
And she forgoes the one chance she had to meet Mrs
Akhras in person and see what kind of life she lives
(the Akras family originally came from Jaffa, but now live crammed into a refugee camp only 4 miles from where the Levys live in comparative luxury
Any sympathy I would have had for the obviously well to do Mrs
Levy is dissolved by her air of self-righteous bitchiness
By contrast, Ayats mother comes off as kind,forthright and loving- in spite of the best efforts by the post production crew to paint her and her family as monsters
Heck even the music and sound design was one sided- I guess the muezzin sings ALL day every day 4 miles from the Levy family home, always in a sharply contrasting key from the sappy new-age music that scores this drab excuse for a documentary
Also there is the small matter of translations - Mrs
Levy DIRECTLY addresses the camera in English when she has something worked out to say ahead of time, Hebrew when she doesn't
Akhras spoke only Arabic which received sometimes a TRANSLATION, sometimes TRANSLITERATION, always awkward, and very suspect for a supposedly objective movie
They also "sweated" her under the lights, while Mrs
I gave it a 2 because I liked Ayats mother and father, who seemed like good decent people
Shame on HBO, producers and director, for releasing such a stink-bomb
I'm a fan of arty movies, but regretfully I have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel
Agonisingly slow to develop a non-existent plot based on a promising premise, the experience is, shall we say, trying
Even after bad movies I feel that I learn something, or enjoyed some aspect, but there there was nothing to appreciate
The premise was not uninteresting, but the movie starts and ends there
The acting was OK, though the characters were utterly boring
For the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal, she is mightily empty
I usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic, but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content
This is almost the worst film you will ever see! 2012 Doomsday currently pulls the rug from under this one, for me
The props are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa once referred to as 'cheepnis
' It looks as if the space scenes were made in a 1950s power station, just prior to demolition
The characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing
It is immediately and brazenly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films
<br /><br />But you have to see it, if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest wastes of a tiny budget ever
This is a priceless example of a stupid movie
Okay, so I'm not a big video game buff, but was the game House of the Dead really famous enough to make a movie from? Sure, they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie, as though justifying any particular scene of violence, but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same, with the hand in the bottom on the screen, supposedly your own, holding whatever weapon and goo-ing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be
<br /><br />It's an interesting premise in House of the Dead, with a lot of college kids (LOADED college kids, as it were, kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like $1,500 just for a ride after they miss their boat) trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year
The first thing that comes to mind about House of the Dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations
At least in this case, the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed
They look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter-tops, but at least they THOUGHT they were dressed for the occasion
<br /><br />Clint Howard, tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far, delivers an absolutely awful performance, the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie
I can't stand it when well-known actors change their accents in movies, it is so rarely effective, and Howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an well-known actor pretend that he's this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air
It sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something
Real tough there, Clint! I expected more from him, but then again, he did agree to a part in this mess
<br /><br />Once we get to the island, the movie temporarily turns into any one of the Friday the 13th movies that took place at Camp Crystal Lake
Lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed
The nudity was impressive, I guess, but let's consider something for a minute
These kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the Rave Of The Year, find NO ONE, and say, well, who wants a beer! Even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there didn't think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight
Here you have the input from director Uwe Boll - There's alcohol! They won't notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves!<br /><br />So not only do they start drinking, not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island, but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is (dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along), the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they're alone
It's like they expected to find the island empty, and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while, they would have some privacy since there's no one else around
Brilliant!<br /><br />Now for the things that everyone hated, judging by the reviews that I've read about the movie
Yes, intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie, mostly in order to show that, yes, the movie was being faithful to/directly copying the video game
I can't imagine who thought up that little nugget, but worse than that is the Matrix-style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over
After the first time (at which point I found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original) it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film
<br /><br />One of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans, who are much faster but getting tired, running out of places to run, and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with
The first two are done right in the movie, the kids are terrified and don't have a lot of places to run since they're on an island, but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler, they find themselves heavily armed
I mean, these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades, which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead
<br /><br />Then you have what I call the techno-slasher scene
Since the rave never happened, and I guess since Uwe Boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie, there's one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead, and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video
There's techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it's nothing but a blur of gory shot, mostly only about 5 frames long (which is about 1/6 of a second) flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music
Clever, I guess, but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the gross-out effect because you can't see any one thing for long enough to react to it
You're just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie
<br /><br />I've seen a lot of people compare this movie to Resident Evil, mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it, and they're exactly right
I appreciate that at least here, as was not the case in Resident Evil, it wasn't some man-made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people, changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires
28 Days Later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie, it's just too bad that House of the Dead didn't do a single original thing, except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based, just in case you forget
I really think that this should have been a much better movie
While obviously I can't say that I know much about the game it's based on, just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie, but unfortunately I think that's more often the case than not with horror movies
It's really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no-holds-barred horror film, and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot, which suggests the possibility of a sequel
I own almost every Seagal movie (yes even ones like this that are low budget), and I must say, this may be the worst, not only of his movies, but of all movies ever made
The only highlight of this film, and only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, is that A
Seagal does have some sweet action sequences, specifically in the store, and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife
Next time give me 90 minutes of Seagal killing people, and don't even bother with a story line, because the storyline not only stunk, but so did the acting, the fact that F-18's and F-14's somehow changed into F-16s, and also the fact that the Stealth was as fast as an F-16
Also the Stealth never had to refuel??? And since when is Afghanistan considered hostile territory from an Air Force stand point
last I checked, Afghanistan has no Air Force, we (USA) control the skies
Also, this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room, yet the Admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret
Also, how did Seagal go from the bottom of the truck, to the top? PLease tell us why they jailed him, Since when are Air Force pilots great commandos (unless they are Owen Wilson?) And since when are their drunks in Arab countries, considering Muslims don't drink alcohol? Also on top of that, since when do Arabs listen to orders from females like the #2 in charge? The highlight of the film was definitely Seagal killing people in the store, and the other 50 people he killed with a knife, as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere
Movie didn't have much plot and was uninteresting
Basically you spend a lot of time watching people paint
Also it's very difficult to hear or understand the dialogue -- partially because of the accents, but also because words are mumbled
I've been watching old Westerns on British TV for decades, and I wasn't aware of this one until its showing yesterday - most other Scott Westerns come around every few years or so and are usually worth watching again
<br /><br />The rich colour and outdoor sets were good, but that's all I can say about this film
I have to agree with most of the other negative comments already made
Several times I felt like turning it off, and finally I did, halfway through, something I hardly ever do
<br /><br />Scott seemed unusually oily in charming the girls, his two sidekicks were annoying and so was the Mexican bandit lad
And I've a feeling the army uniforms were 20 years or so too modern, not that this has bothered makers of many other Westerns
<br /><br />Perhaps it got better in the second half, but I couldn't be bothered to wait and see
<br /><br />I'm not sure who decides what category a movie fits into, but this movie is NOT a horror movie
As for the story, it was fairly interesting, but rather slow
I was especially disappointed with the ending though
<br /><br />**spoiler**<br /><br />Tell me why on Earth does she run over to her uncle's(?) home without at least calling the detective or the police first? She knows exactly what's going on at that point, plus she has a video tape as proof
Instead, she runs over there and starts going nuts and saying "I know everything, I have proof! You didn't expect proof, did you?!" Then she acts surprised when her uncle stands up and starts walking over to her as if he's going to harm her
Well DUH! Of course he's going to harm you idiot, you just told him you know everything and have proof to expose everything
it did nothing to me, the only descent scene is where everyone comes together at the party, and a nice song is playing, uplifting beat and nice cinematic shots that make you move
Otherwise this film lacks everything to suck the viewer in There's no story, there's nothing to think about like some people say, there's no cohesion between the different stories
it was more of an attempt to re-do Anderson's 'Magnolia' which was brilliant, but it fails blatantly
Okay it's light and easy to watch, but that are movieclips too
Maybe first write a story before you make a movie
4/10 One of the worst Belgian movies I've see
It felt as though the writer/director was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of ALL of its characters
<br /><br />This is the job of television, not cinema
<br /><br />The location of the train station was well chosen and I enjoyed Sascha Horler's performance as the pregnant friend
<br /><br />I felt as though Justine Clarke's performance was wan
Her reactions to things felt forced, as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonist's expressions
I also can't believe that a director can make the wonderful Daniela Farinacci into an unbelievable presence
<br /><br />I cannot understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences
This is a lazy device, especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film and/or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest
<br /><br />That said, there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the Australian heat and local attitude with originality
It does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine
Especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity, infusing it with passion and hand-crafted charm
<br /><br />I am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked
"Who knows if there's a god? Like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do" or whatever the line was
<br /><br />Perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife "I'm giving up smoking
" <br /><br />An anti-smoking commercial? A TAC ad with some tasteful animation? I had to leave the cinema at the 50 minute mark -- it was all too much
To put it simply, I am not fond of westerns
And having never sat through one from beginning to end, I decided to watch "My Darling Clementine" and see it all the way through, no matter how painful it was for me
I found the acting to be laughable, the scenery (your standard dessert, horses and cowboys) boring and the music and its timing teetering on the edge of painful
However, after mentally pep talking myself to struggle on, after the first 20 minutes it began to be quite a bit easier for me to endure
Focusing in on the cinematography, and how John Ford managed to make even the dullest situations (dull according to me that is) look quite stunning at times, made it a lot more interesting
<br /><br />In conclusion, I can't go so far as to say that I enjoyed the movie by the end of it
However it was made well enough for me to sit all the way through to the very end, and that in itself impresses me
because 99 out of 100 times, the producers lied through their teeth (or someone else's) to get you to rent or buy their *mercifully censored*
<br /><br />Shock-O-Rama Cinema proves the truth of this yet one more time with the release of "Feeding the Masses," a possibly well-intentioned but utterly inept and dismal entry into the zombie genre
Folks, this is not only low-budget film-making, this is VERY low-budget film-making by a bunch of people who--I'm sorry, I know they have families who love them--will never, ever be in Variety in any significant fashion
This is one baaaaaaaaaad mooin' pitcher, folks, and not just because it's cheap
<br /><br />The acting is mediocre, but I don't blame the actors; they had no direction
They had no direction because the script was a half-baked zombie fantasy with no sense of real cinematic storytelling
Characterization is thin at best, no thanks to weak dialogue and soporific direction
Have I mentioned yet that the script and the direction are pretty lame? They are
There's no drama, no tension, no great character moments, nothing
The whole premise of government suppression of the media is squandered on sophomoric "commercial breaks" and an undramatic storyline that defies rational analysis and awkwardly shambles to its ridiculous finish
<br /><br />How could the government suppress the truth of a virulent zombie epidemic when the reality of it would be apparent everywhere? Why would they give it more than a cursory try? In this day and age of cellphone cameras with wireless access, what could they possibly hope to accomplish for more than a day or so at best? Now, if they were covering something up, like their own culpability
but "Feeding the Masses" never explores such possibilities
Instead, it dwells on absurdity and poorly staged events to dig for laughs and/or significance, praying its audience won't notice the near total lack of production value beyond basic film-making equipment
Did anyone in this film get paid? I hope the actors did, if only for their time wasted on career blind alleys like this one; at least the techies got to rack up some legitimate work experience
<br /><br />Even zombie fans will find little to gain from "Feeding the Masses
" The gore is remarkably tame for no-budgeters of its rank, and there are no distinctive set pieces or memorable effects
They're all eminently forgettable, in fact
<br /><br />Even junk like the Aussie stillbirth "Undead" was miles ahead of "Feeding the Masses
" Sorry, guys, back to the drawing boards, and take your deceptive marketing with you
Personality himself, this time is the United States' greatest Stealth pilot who is promised a pardon from the military(
who attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base, later caught after interrupting a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas station)if he is able to successfully infiltrate a Northern Afghanistan terrorist base operated by a group called Black Sunday, who have commandeered an Air Force stealth fighter thanks to an American traitor
Along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor, Jannick(Mark Bazeley), John Sands(Seagal)will fly into enemy territory, receiving help from his Arab lover, Jessica(Ciera Payton)and a freedom fighter, Rojar(Alki David) once they are on ground
Jannick is kidnapped by Black Sunday leaders, Stone(Vincenzo Nicoli)and his female enforcer, Eliana(Katie Jones), and Sands must figure out how to not only re-take command of the kidnapped stealth fighter, but rescue him as well
And, maybe, Sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained, Rather(Steve Toussaint)in the process
Sands has 72 hours until a General's Navy pilots bomb the entire area
On board the stealth, Black Sunday equipped a biochemical bomb, hoping to detonate it on the United States
<br /><br />Seagal gets a chance to shoot Afghans when he isn't slicing their throats with knives
The film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead
The setting of Afghanistan doesn't hold up to scrutiny(
are able to move about the area undetected so easily) and the plot itself is nothing to write home about
The movie is edited fast, the camera a bit too jerky
Seagal isn't as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his foes, unlike the good old days
One of Seagal's poorest efforts, and he's as understated as ever(
Even more disappointing is the fact that Seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the film's chief villains, tis a shame
He doesn't even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible way(
sure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around, but it's not as clear a picture as I enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and dizzying close-ups)
turned out to be another failed attempt by the laughable sci-fi channel
i am not sure who wrote the script, and interpreted the poem, but i am sure it was by some 17 year old teen who thought it would be awesome to a have a scoped crossbow in the movie
AAAAAAAH! when i saw that part, I lost all hope
they set off for heorot in a what looks to be the ship that Christopher Columbus sailed in! when they reach Heorot, (which is supposed to be a Norse mead hall) the sci-fi group of idiots decided to make heorot look like a big stone castle
i really wanted this movie to be good, but sci-fi has yet to produce a good movie, so i don't know why i got my hopes up
and Grendel and his mother, are stupid also
(this comment is off topic about "Grendel")If anyone from the sci-fi channel is reading this
NOT EVERY MOVIE YOU MAKE HAS TO BE ABOUT A BIG MONSTER THAT CAN RIP PEOPLE IN HALF, THATS NOT WHAT SCIENCE FICTION IS ABOUT! AND ALSO, STOP CASTING LOW-GRADE ACTORS LIKE STEPHEN BALDWIN TO BE IN YOUR FILMS! ITS NOT HELPING THE MOVIE, BUT MAKING IT WORSE!!
Had I checked IMDb BEFORE renting this DVD from Netflix, I'd have a couple of hours of my life back
I'm frankly suspicious when I see that a film's director also wrote it
In this case, according to the credits, the same guy was "writter and director" - unfortunately, an indication of the overall quality of this production
, Judy Tenuta's scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting Judy-ism) which led me to rate this two stars rather than one
Those moments, however, were few and far between
and I almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me, not to mention reprehensible in its violence
I admit I went back to watch that part again to see if I had missed something that would help me figure it out once I'd seen the whole thing
Nope, though I at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later
The "spinning camera" technique was overused and essentially pointless
I found myself talking to the TV screen: "What?!?" or "For goodness sake, get ON with it!" Not recommended
I initially gained interest in this film after reading a review saying this movie reminded the reviewer of Silent Hill
<br /><br />Being a huge Silent Hill fan, and disappointed with it's movie debut, I thought I would give this one a chance
Mind, Fearnet only lists this movie as "Dark Floors", not by it's full name
Lordi" in the credits I immediately thought of the band (I had a few friends in college that like them) but didn't think it was important and quickly pushed the thought aside
Despite the fact "creepy little girl" has been done to DEATH, the good use of audio and sense of isolation really started to piece the the story together
The tense atmosphere built rapidly, and every indication pointed to the film being excellent
As monsters are the true stars of horror, I couldn't wait to see what was lurking in the halls of the hospital the main characters had found themselves trapped in
<br /><br />And then the first monster showed up, and I found myself greatly underwhelmed
By the time the second appeared, I boggled at the fact it looked like it had just come from a Megadeth concert, and the silliness turned me off completely
<br /><br />Over the course of the movie the atmosphere did remain intact, and the story left you wondering just what was going on, but the scares were pretty much non-existent
However, I held out hope that the end would make it all worthwhile
Unfortunately that was not to be the case
By the time the movie had reached it's climax, I was in utter disbelief, and I immediately recognized the big bad in his final reveal
The lead singer of Lordi? Seriously? <br /><br />Was that what the movie all boiled down to? A bunch of poor souls being chased around a hospital by Lordi band members? The silly monster design suddenly made sense
If you're going to be that corny, may as well through the members of Marilyn Manson, or even KISS in there too
Not to mention the fact that I'm pretty sure I saw the ending in one of Lordi's music videos a few years ago
They had to go and make an entire movie off of it? <br /><br />Worst of all, when I found out what really had been going on, all I could manage was a yawn
I'm not going to "ruin" it for you, but I can safely say it's probably a plot device you've seen before
<br /><br />So, unless you're a huge Lordi fan, stay away from this
It's not scary, it doesn't bring anything new to the table (although it does a decent job of borrowing from other horror movies, mainly Silent Hill)
And, I can't stress this enough, LORDI is the antagonist
<br /><br />Really, you'd be better off trying to scare yourself watching Slipknot music videos
"Kings and Queen" is a bloated French drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty-two minutes to no discernible point or purpose
<br /><br />The film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie
The first centers around Nora and her struggles with various men in her life, including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live
The other story involves a young man named Ismael, a violinist who finds himself placed - unfairly, he believes - in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party
After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile, these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that Ismael is a former lover of Nora's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier, tragic relationship
<br /><br />With a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining, "Kings and Queen" might have been a potent, engrossing drama about modern day relationships
It certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power, and the performances are, for the most part, complex and touching
But, taken as a whole, the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that, quite frankly, it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on
Even more distressing is the fact that, even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people, we really don't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over
For instance, Nora's father, on his deathbed, writes a withering diatribe against his daughter's character that simply doesn't gibe with the woman we've been looking at for well over two hours
Nora is admittedly no Mother Theresa (then, again, who is?), but she certainly doesn't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father
Nora could be accused of being confused, indecisive, a bit self-absorbed at times, but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place? I don't think so
<br /><br />Perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that I was unable to fathom
But my suspicion is that even writer Roger Bohbot and co-writer/director Arnaud Desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here
This is a well acted, pretentious bore of a film that takes the viewer on a long, rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises, a journey that leaves him no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning
Being a big fan of the "other" PLANET OF THE APES films, I rented this DVD despite my aversion to all things Tim Burton
Once again, he doesn't fail to disappoint with his uninspired direction
Even the ape makeup looks second rate, which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity
Mark Wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor (as if BOOGIE NIGHTS wasn't proof enough)
I was embarrassed for genuine talents such as Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter
No doubt their paychecks motivated them since it couldn't possibly have been the cliche-ridden screenplay
I rented this DVD on a special $1 night and I still feel ripped off
Alfred Hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think of:he set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him
<br /><br />The main subject of this Bullock vehicle ,all the ideas,almost everything was already in Hitchcock's classic " Rope":the two students who commit a gratuitous crime, Nietsche's philosophy,and the clues that the boys disseminate ,the Master was the first to transfer them to the screen
And with an eighty-minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force
<br /><br />"Murder by numbers " does not take place in a single room,like "the rope" ,mind you
And ,what a supreme originality,it pits two cops against the evil youngsters;and ,you would never guess it,these two cops are very different:actually,Bullock plays the part of woman living like a man ,and her partner (Chaplin) is as shy as a clueless girlie
The two boys' performances are not really mind-boggling ,not as good ,as ,say ,that of Edward Norton in "primal fear"
<br /><br />Well,you know ," Rope" was so good
I can't believe I watched this expecting more
This movie pushes the limits of reality way to far!! At least the first one was somewhat realistic
It rips off the first movie and even mentions the Joshua Project
Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie
It does have one good message in it though, WATCH OUT FOR BIG BROTHER!!! The movie just makes it seem like Big Brother is way bigger than he actually is in reality
Even the make-up on the actors was completely bad
The script was OK at some points and completely messed up at other parts
This movie plays on convenience about every five minutes
Like I said, I can't believe I watched it expecting more
I think I am gonna pop in the original to get back to earth
I cannot stand this show! Has there ever been even one redeeming quality, one funny punchline, or one plot line that "didn't" make the average viewer want to drown himself in a bowl of soggy cornflakes? <br /><br />The voices
Akin to repeatedly dragging a set of fine cutlery across a dusty blackboard, each character is uniquely annoying in his or her aptitude for shrill, nasal vocals
Cosmo sounds like a whining mongrel, Vicky sounds like a stereotypical shrew, and Timmy's dad makes every line sound like a bad impersonation of a game show host (Guy Smiley from "Sesame Street" comes to mind)
<br /><br />The animation is awful; even the producers of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" laugh at the overwhelmingly bad artwork on this show
Every character has buck teeth, or a square head, or a head three sizes too big for his or her body
And what's with having the characters speak every single line wide-eyed and grinning, as though posing for a photo op with the president? Then, there is the fact that every character on the show is completely moronic
Not since the subtle grace of Amelia Bedelia, Homer Simpson, and Buddy Lembeck of "Charles in Charge" fame have characters been portrayed as so unrealistically dumb
Usually "unrealistic" is synonymous with "unfunny", and that is most definitely the case here
There hasn't been this much slapstick based on cluelessness since "The Naked Gun 33 1/3"
and at least Leslie Nielson was good at it
<br /><br />Finally, the premise of the show (and it's the same every single episode, so big time spoiler alert here): Timmy wishes for something with his two "Fairly Oddparents", something goes wrong, there's always some contrived reason why he can't immediately reverse course and wish away the damage, and then everything turns out just fine in the end
Oh, and on a side note, Timmy's parents never believe him when he complains about Vicky, and they continue to employ her at every opportunity
Maybe it's just me, but it seems that a kids' show containing the subtle message that it pretty much does no good whatsoever to tell on an abusive babysitter probably isn't a great idea
<br /><br />If you're writing a paper and want to cite an example of just how far the quality of cartoons has fallen, "The Fairly Odd Parents" has to be a great place to start
A prime example of television producers throwing together a worthless product aimed at kids with little or no effort simply because they know that someone somewhere will watch it
"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film" is not a film as such, but it is a short series of clips with a comical slapstick theme
This 'film' got Richard Lester recognised and paved the way for him to direct the first Beatles film: 'A Hard Day's Night"
<br /><br />Richard Lester directed and wrote the music for his first film in 1959
This film was entitled The Running, Jumping, & Standing Still Film
It was intended to be viewed only by those who had aided in its production
Since the film was intended to be viewed by Lester and his partners alone, a small amount of money and time was invested
The sole purpose of this film is entertainment, but the main reason for its existence is the fact that it served as an experiment to work the camera
The film cost 70£ to make, and it was filmed in sepia-toned film stock in a field on a couple of Sundays
All of the shots that were filmed were included in the finished production; the finished production is eleven minutes in length
<br /><br />The Running, Jumping, & Standing Still Film is a comedy about English Sundays and the small hobbies that people do to pass the time
All of the events in this film take place in a field
A few of these comical events include a woman scrubbing a lawn, a man running around a tree stump with a needle to play a record, a photographer developing film in a pond, an artist aided in painting by the numbers on a model's face, a man building a tent, an athlete running over the tent, and a duel between a man with a knife and a man with a gun
Not only does the film poke fun at the hobbies that people do to pass the time away, but it also pokes fun at English culture when compared to American culture
Another one of several events in this film includes a group of men and a kite, which has been constructed out of the flag of the United Kingdom
One of the men jumps inside the kite while the other men attempt to fly it, and the kite breaks
According to Neil Sinyard, author of The Films of Richard Lester, this event symbolizes the United Kingdom as lesser in power and technology when compared to the United States during the space age
According to this scene, the British fly primitive kites while the Americans, the world-power after World War II, fly highly-advanced rockets and space shuttles
As someone who was staggered at the incredible visuals of "Hero," I was anxious to see this film which was billed as being along the same lines, but better
It also featured an actress I like: Ziyi Zhang
I bought the DVD of this film sight-unseen, and that was a mistake
<br /><br />I realize these flying-through-the-air martial arts films are pure fantasy but this story is stretched so far past anything remotely believable it just made me shake my head in disappointing disbelief
A blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents? Sorry, that's going a little far
Also, the major male character 'Jin" (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so annoying with his dialog, stupid look on his face and stupid laugh, that he ruined the film, too
<br /><br />Despite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes, this story - to me - just didn't have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning
The first half of this version was the best I've seen (and I think I've seen every version of Jane Eyre ever made)
The development of Jane's childhood and character were exceptional
Then, it was as though someone said "Uh oh, this is running too long," and hacked the rest of the story to shreds
The major scenes, when included at all, are glossed over, combined, and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the storyline
There was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow
The big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope, and then the end dashed it
Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography
I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi
I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages
In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves
, I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film
The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me
How does a Scotsman in a kilt make love in the bonny purple heather? Very,very carefully
Now I have the distinct advantage over many other of the reviewers in that I was born in Scotland
Far too many Americans take this simplistic nonsense seriously
It's a joke,people,"four legs good - two legs bad",as Orwell had it
Jessica Lange has an accent that the Wells - next - the - sea Amateur Dramatic Society's production of "Brigadoon" would turn down
Liam Neeson - apparently popular with the ladies - wears his kilt with all the authority of a man whose Great Grandmama once stepped off the train at Edinburgh Waverley
And the Auld Enemy?Where would the Scots be without them to hate and blame for everything?Messrs Roth,Cox and Hurt should be ashamed for indulging in such racist stereotyping
"Robin Hood - Prince of thieves" seems a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison
Really, everybody in this movie looks like they want to be someplace else! No wonder, the casting is done not with the left hand, but rather not at all
I haven't seen anything worse than Natascha McElhone impersonating some sort of agent, carrying a gun
You don't use a spoiled city-brat-look in such a role
The only worse thing I can imagine is casting Doris Day as a prostitute
The rest of the cast is likewise awful, possibly with Hurt as the sole exception, sometimes you can see him trying, but suffering
Oh, did I mention that it is a completely insane story? Jeopardizing many peoples lives because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, it must be because the guy (Weller) is German?<br /><br />2/10, because the photography could be worse
First off, the title character is not even the main character of the movie
The actor who portrays Igor believed that screaming loud, laughing hysterically, and having a crooked smile while bugging out your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people
Igor also had the annoying habit of yelling (because he never actually just spoke) in a high pitched voice
For example when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz saw, Igor upon seeing this, yells out "Paul! No Paul! Why'd you do it? I could have cut her clean! So clean!" In another scene Igor tells a victim that she would have to 'get her own tools for surgery because right now, it was his time to operate
' Aside from the bad acting, the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax, which is Igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed, he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining 'good guys'
The movie offers no explanation of this, only telling the viewer that Igor escaped from the mental hospital
What??? Bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie
I wish I could get back the moments I lost watching this
Jill Dunne (played by Mitzi Kapture), is an attractive, nice woman, over-whelmed by a smart-mouthed teenage daughter, Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and a petty, two-timing husband, Sean (Rick Roberts), both of which were tediously self-centered, and obnoxious
<br /><br />This was advertised as a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a relentless storm
<br /><br />The storm doesn't even happen until about the last 5 minutes of the film, and then it isn't anything to send anybody running to the storm cellar
<br /><br />The stalking, likewise doesn't get intense until almost the end of the film
<br /><br />Most of the film we spend listening to Jill and her insufferable daughter, Liv, argue until I just wanted to back slap the daughter into next week
<br /><br />Jill's problem with Liv is that she has taken up with Zack, a boy of questionable character, and they are constantly making out--in fact Jill comes home to find the two of them on Liv's bed
<br /><br />The rest of the time we spend listening to Jill's husband Sean either whine at Jill or criticize her
<br /><br />Sean was not at all appealing--since his face is so covered in freckles you could play connect the dots
<br /><br />The story begins with Jill being notified of an out-standing bill on their credit card for a hotel she has never been to, and that she thought Sean had never been to either
<br /><br />Jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner & manager, Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very nice, older, divorced man, who is sympathetic to her
In fact, when he spots her husband there again, he phones Jill and tips her off
<br /><br />Jill returns to the hotel, sees Sean with another woman
She is upset, leaves without Sean seeing her, and does absolutely nothing
In fact, she doesn't even say anything to Sean when he arrives home
<br /><br />Jill has given Richard her business card, and so he calls her and she is apparently in real estate
Afterwards they have a drink, and things get cozy between them
<br /><br />Richard and Jill are getting it on, hot and heavy
In fact, he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary, when Jill suddenly decides to cut out
<br /><br />Jill and Sean have a confrontation about his cheating
Sean whines about how Jill has been letting him down since her father died
Apparently his lack of any morals is all her fault
Eventually Jill confesses her own lack of morals and near adultery to Sean--and of course that's all her fault too, as far as Sean is concerned
<br /><br />The little family decides to go on a camping trip--which means more whining and grousing among them, especially from the spoiled daughter
<br /><br />I was so rooting for the stalker to get everybody, but Jill
To make any film about the supposed end of the world, there should be some facts & realism 1
We are never told why these people believe this
Location is New Years Eve In Toronto Canada
SO PLEASE SOME ONE TELL ME WHY WAS THEN STILL SHINING AT MIDNIGHT & WHY(based on the costumes) DID IT SEEM LIKE SEPTEMBER<br /><br />3
The acting was in that neo-au-natural style, that needed a director who knew how to do it
the individual story pieces were all dreary & without any purpose
I could go on, But I do not want to make this as boring as the film
<br /><br /> rating *1/2 (out of 4) 2 on IMDB scale<br /><br />thank you I am as always<br /><br /> JAY HARRIS (aka)SIRBOSSMA
If derivative and predictable rape-revenge thrillers are your thing, then you're in for a rare treat
They don't really appeal to me, so I couldn't find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale
It seems like something straight out of the 1980s, a different age when this would have gone straight to video
Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer do OK work with a weak script and a tedious scenario
But what is Gillian Anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year? The director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near-rape and by his work on documentaries, but even that's not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up Dyer
I don't think I was the only person in the cinema laughing
What I can't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures
Both have been involved in some great independent British films in recent years
Verve distributed Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath
FilmFour and Verve take note: is this really the best you can do? What are independent British filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement? It's a big blot on both of your reputations
Listen carefully: can you hear the thousands of fans of independent British films crying in despair
The day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of Azumi's fate as an assassin, fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga
<br /><br />That's as poetical as I'll get when talking about Azumi 2: Death or Love, because when I cringed over the heavy sentimentality of House of Flying Daggers and complained about the credibility of Aya Ueto portraying a blood-driven assassin, after watching Azumi 2 I started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before
<br /><br />Not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience
In Azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics (which is their number one priority) as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape
But I won't hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in Azumi's way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma
By the way, Chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of Go Go, minus the cool weapon and sense of menace
<br /><br />This brings me to the final blow which is the action, simply disguised in the title as the 'Death' side of the epic
In the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons
To no one's surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily
In Azumi 1, the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between Azumi and Bijomaru in comparison to the fights in Azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile
Some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter
I am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both Azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched
<br /><br />The romance side of Azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution
<br /><br />As a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation, I won't lie and I'll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first Azumi film, but I'll step right up and say that after watching Azumi 2, the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece
For what it's worth, Azumi 2: Death or Love could have gone straight to video, with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins, doing their best to restore the peace, with an unwavering courage to die trying
I've just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions
A bunch of kids, 14 to 22 put on the DVD of "Titanic" on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal
Only two of them had actually seen it before
But they all had seen the moment of Kate, Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie
Shortly after the epic started, they started to get restless, some of them left asking the others -- "call us when the iceberg appears" Over an hour and a half into the movie, only the two girls who had seen the movie before, were still there
A stampede followed, they all came back to see the sinking of the Titanic
They sat open mouthed, emitting Ohs and far outs
So, just like I thought when the movie first burst into the scene
What is this? One and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it
Zivagho, for instance, had a similar running time, but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time
In "Titanic" Leo teaches Kate how to spit
Look at the faces and hands of the, supposedly, creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship
Look at the historical details, if you can find them
The storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink
The real sinking here is of film standards
All the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends
The film went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time so, what do I know
They should have called this movie: "Adopted Mouse Brother That is Slightly Inspired by Someone's Vague Recollection of Stuart Little Who Just Kind of Skimmed the Book a Little, But Mostly Just Remembered the Cover" If it wasn't so misleading I'd give it a better review
<br /><br />But seriously people, do your kids a favor and have them read the book
They might actually learn something instead of having their mind numbed by what we all know as Hollywood film
<br /><br />The book Stuart little isn't about a mouse, it's about a person who happens to be very small and mouse-like
The book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and the journey he embarks on
There is a cat named Snowball who thinks he's food and wants to eat him, but Snowball can't talk
<br /><br />In the movie they screw all of that up
I think the only things that they kept from the book were the boat race and the names
I was lured to see this movie by its starpower, but ultimately that's all it delivers
It plays much more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption
It's greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense
We know who the bad guys are from the beginning, and just follow along as they fall like dominoes
The film to its credit does abstain from gratuitous violence and sex, but has forgotten to substitute good, clean romance or excitement in any other way
All the flavor of a good, flat decaffeinated diet cola
"Q&A", which also takes place in New York, is a far better alternative, as is "LA Confidential"
When I saw this trailer on TV I was surprised
In May of 2008 I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and this was showing at a 4-D attraction (you know, the attraction that the seats move)
I take it that the version I saw was a shortened version (15 min
) and also re-created to add the motion effects
It was educational and told about the first mission but the ending of a CGI spacewalk seemed a bit
I was not a big fan of the movie but i would recommend this movie for any parent wanting to inform their children in a fun way about the first moonwalk
I will say, the character actors were well selected and the characters themselves were cute
So all-in-all, I would say, if you want to bring the younger kids
But if you are wanting to take your older kids, take them to another movie
This film is a twisted nonsense of a movie, set in Japan about a dysfunctional family who end up with a strange violent guest who just sits back and watches the 4 members of the family at their worst
Nothing is sacred in this movie, with sex drugs and violence stretched to such a limit i'm surprised it got past the censors
<br /><br />Overall, i think it will appeal only to those whom we shouldn't be encouraging, rather than any supposed underlying message coming out for the rest of us to consider
A film that panders to the worst element in society and is in anyway utter gash
A disappointment from a man who made the sublime Dead or Alive and Audition movies
I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a while
what with all it's raving reviews, nominations and media attention
And I must say, the first quarter of the movie was good! It really portrayed the black music scene back then
However, as the movie wore on, me and my whole family were bored out of our wits
The singing just kept coming, one after the other
I mean seriously, just one more music number and it would have broke even with RENT
<br /><br />Furthermore, I noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters; I just didn't care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died of a drug overdose, I knew I should have been sad, but I just couldn't feel any emotion for that character
The characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot, but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in
<br /><br />Finally, the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care, which goes along with the lack of character development
This movie reminded me of a copy-cat movie based on Ray, Chicago, and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion)
Overall I think this movie would best suit someone who doesn't really care about an overall story, yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances
I understand wanting to make a movie that is edgy and different
I understand the previous reviewer comments that this is a miss-understood movie
My point is as soon as this movie ended my first comment was: " this is what happens when a rich princess wants to be a movie star and has no talent"
she uses daddy's' money to make a movie she wrote, directs, and pays for
obviously to close to the movie to realize there was no character development and no directions such as a beginning, middle and ending
the voyeur part was good and edgy but what was the point? I saw a women go to a house, find some pictures, screw the caretaker, come out side on a very cold night (not believable) to check on noise and runs over her caretaker lover
some one educate my ignorant arss?? I really want to know what the point is
why no development of the dead lover? Why no background on the caretaker? What is the point of the night vision? What is the point of the lipstick on the car? Why a dead caretaker? Why tell us about an escaped mental patient/peeping tom? What's with the urn? Oh and the lamp is that suppose to signify whose' house this is? Territorial? Why? Why would the caretaker feel like it's his house? that aspect was never pursued
I rented this movie because he was in it and known for edgy characters
write back and do tell me what I need to learn
I am just a mom in middle America who loves movies
It runs a bit slow early on but ends if a flurry of gooped up De Vil
The basic plot is the same as the first movie
The bright side of the movie for adults is the talking bird that thinks it is a dog
The bird talks like a human(Eric Idle of Monty Python) and barks like a dog
It is the comedy that the film needed more of
See it in the matinee so you don't have to pay full price or wait for it to appear on Disney
97 you'll spend at Walmart to buy this DVD and go see the real film by Steven Spielberg
<br /><br />I'm a filmmaker, and being an avid fan of H
Wells, I had to buy this hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment
Instead, it took four days to finish watching this because I couldn't stand watching more than 10 minutes at a time
<br /><br />There are reports that Timothy Hines had a $20 Million budget for this production
Where the heck did it go? Did he use most of it to buy a new house? Finance his retirement? Or what? Let me start with what is actually good about this film
It does stay true to the book AND there are a few good performances in it
I can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film
But good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible
Any freshman film school student could have done a much better job with the CGI
To me, most of it looked like "stop action" card board cutouts that were used rather than sophisticated CGI software that a $20 Million project should be using
<br /><br />There's no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this film
My own partner and I sat down and recreated our version of the Ferry scene using software that cost less than $1500
00 and within a day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what Hines created
I've seen films with budgets of less than $2 Million look better
<br /><br />In my opinion the special effects used in the original King Kong were more sophisticated and better than Hines' special effects in this film
IN fact, I have a much better appreciation for Attack of the Killer Tomatoes because of this film
There's no excuse with today's technology for a film to look like a 50's B-Movie unless that was the intention, which shouldn't have been with this particular project
<br /><br />A problem I had with the DVD transfer was that the film is jerky, another demonstration of amateur film-making
<br /><br />Overall, I have to say that I produced a $45,000 project in 2003 that have better cinematography and special effects than this film
<br /><br />I strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good film-making or who is a fan of WOTW to leave this film on the shelf and watch Attack of the 50 Foot Woman instead
Wow, could have been such a good movie,Starts of with Brittany Daniels tied up, Im thinking cool we are going to get a flash back, but nothing, movie starts anew with the kid filming
This movie probably would have been better if it wasn't for the acting
Although with the lines the poor actors had to deal with i guess they did the best they could
The twins were the only ones that seem to have some acting skills
The movie drags to long for the supposed shocking conclusion
All in all I have seen worse low budget movies but considering this was hype with the 8 films to die for I was very disappointed
By the way, were did some reviewers say there was gore and stuff
Well this is 4 out of the eight, and so far only one has been any good
A cast of 1980's TV movie and TV series guest stars (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley,Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel among several others)in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models
Of course the models and other people start turning up dead causing all sorts of complications
<br /><br />Over done not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an R rating but not enough good material to engender any real interest
This is best described as the sort of movie that gave the cable channel Cinemax the alternate name of Skinamax
I really can't see the point of watching this unless you need to see every sleazy thriller out there
(I also have to comment that this film is filled with smoking, to the point that it becomes laughable when anyone lights up
Kol, space prisoner on space death row, manages to hijack a space shuttle and escape to the woods of America where he, along with some new found friend try to escape from the 'Alienator" a female cyborg killing machine
Made one year after the best movie of Fred Olen Ray's career, "Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers", this one can't help but feel like a bit of a letdown
Just as low-budget as that earlier film, but not nearly as fun as I had with it
None of the actors really stood out at me
The film is alright for the undiscriminating viewer during a rainy Saturday afternoon, but that's pretty much all it's good for
<br /><br />My Grade: D+ <br /><br />Where i saw it: Showtime Thrille
<br /><br />The Ring is a silent film from 1927 that stars two boxers and the woman that comes between them
She loves the boxer known as "One Round" Jack
She loves him until the champion comes along, that is
Even though she marries One Round, she starts overtly flirting with the champion until the climactic final boxing fight between One Round and the champion
She comes back to One Round's corner, just when things look their bleakest, and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife love back
<br /><br />This film was very early in Hitch's career, but the limitations of the time must not have made him make a lasting film
Although there are special film tricks, and some comedy relief, this film just does not hold up to any of his later work
It must have been extremely risqué for the time period though, with the shameless adulterous wife
While looking through all of these old films, it is amazing how I think that they could be redone on today's screen and really come off
<br /><br />Skip this movie unless you are planning on watching all of Hitchcock's films
I came away from this movie with the feeling that it could have been so much better
Instead of what should be a gripping, tense story of a boy's fight for survival in the wilderness, it comes off as a National Geographic documentary meets Columbia sportswear ad
<br /><br />The film begins with Brian (Jared Rushton) preparing for a journey by plane to see his father
His mother fortuitously gives him the curious choice of a hatchet as a going-away gift (what's wrong with a Rubik's Cube?), little knowing how badly he will soon need it
Once in the air, the plane's pilot (a blink-and-you'll-miss-him cameo by Ned Beatty) suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving Brian helpless as the plane crashes into a lake
Extremely lucky to walk (or rather swim) away virtually unscathed, Brian must find shelter, food and hope for rescue
<br /><br />Here is where the main problem with the movie begins
By the very nature of Brian's solitude, Jared has very few lines to speak, and so the film ought to have compensated by ratcheting up the tension of each scene
Instead, he is shown walking around, sitting around, and so on, with only a minimal sense of danger
As a result, too much reliance is placed on flashbacks to the parents' troubled marriage as the source of tension
These scenes merely get in the way and don't particularly add much to the story
Even worse, occasionally Jared  his face covered with mud - lets out a primal scream or two, which conjures up unfortunate parallels to `Predator
' Speaking of unfortunate, we could have done with being spared the sight of his mullet, but it presumably helped keep him warm at night
<br /><br />Another disappointment is Pamela Sue Martin in a totally ineffectual performance as the mother
Both she and the father have very little impact in the movie
For instance, we are never shown how they react to news of Brian's disappearance, how they might be organizing rescue attempts, and so on
This is just one source of tension the film-makers would have done well to explore instead of spending so much time on events that happened before Brian embarked on his journey
Most college students find themselves lost in the bubble of academia, cut off from the communities in which they study and live
Their conversations are held with their fellow students and the college faculty
Steven Greenstreet's documentary is a prime example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of its members
<br /><br />The documentary focused on a small group of individuals who were portrayed as representing large groups of the population
As is usual, the people who scream the most get the most media attention
Other than its misrepresentation of the community in which the film was set, the documentary was well made
My only dispute is that the feelings and uproar depicted in the film were attributed to the entire community rather than the few individuals who expressed them
<br /><br />Naturally it is important to examine a controversy like this and make people aware of the differences that exist between political viewpoints, but it is ridiculous to implicate an entire community of people in the actions of a few radicals
A cowboy sympathetic to the plight of a nearby Indian tribe is wrongly accused in the rape and murder of the chief's daughter, leading to much hate and violence
<br /><br />This crackpot nudie feature is fun to look at, though thoroughly impossible to defend on any artistic level
The terrible costumes and the fact that all the Indians are obviously white, makes this look more like a live action cartoon than the serious production that it's press materials pretends it to be
<br /><br />In short, the plentiful nudity (the real reason for watching this) is good
There's definitely better examples of both genres
<br /><br />More interesting is that The Ramrodder was filmed at the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and features not one, but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who was probably already in the can for murder at the time this hit the soda-stained screens of the Pussycat Theater
The Christmas Secret was touted as a wonderful film, but I was truly disappointed
They even sold VHS and DVD copies of the film when it was over, which leads me to think the producers were really proud of this project
As a screen actor myself I felt most of the performances were phoned in, although Beau Bridges, as Nick, did have a moment or two
If I were Richard Thomas I would not put this film on my otherwise fine resume
I had been a fan since his Waltons days, but have found myself untempted to watch any of his subsequent work, so poor was this offering
<br /><br />In defence of the actors, the directing was stilted, mechanical, and thoroughly amateurish
<br /><br />I hope this is not considered a spiteful review and negative assumptions made about my qualifications as a critic
I turned the movie on because it had a good cast and I was prepared to enjoy the film
However I would challenge any one out there to watch this film and not wish for their money back, even though it was on T
I found this movie to be a great idea, that didn't deliver
It seems they found a way to build suspense, but couldn't stage their payoffs very well
In one case the police, are on the clock to find the hideout of the kidnappers
They painstakingly go from dentist to dentist to match a dental record
At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft
After all the build up, the police arrive at the same time he gets free, which is very anti-climatic to say the least
There are also large narration scenes that take us "inside the thinking" of the terrorized husband and wife, which detracts from the suspense rather than adds to it
We are fully aware of their tension, and the voice-over is an insult and robs the viewer of any chance of a personal experience with the fear, as Hitchcock proved time and again, is far more effective
The greatest disappointment, is to sit through the whole movie, and the get the quick, rather bland ending
85:1<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />A woman turns the tables on a would-be rapist when he mounts an assault in her home, and is forced to decide whether to kill him or inform the police, in which case he could be released and attack her again
<br /><br />Exploitation fans who might be expecting another rough 'n' ready rape fantasy in the style of DAY OF THE WOMAN (1978) will almost certainly be disappointed by EXTREMITIES
True, Farrah Fawcett's character is subjected to two uncomfortably prolonged assaults before gaining the upper hand on her attacker (a suitably slimy James Russo), but scriptwriter William Mastrosimone and director Robert M
Young take these unpleasant scenes only so far before unveiling the dilemma which informs the moral core of this production
Would their final solution hold up in a court of law? Maybe
<br /><br />Based on a stage play which reportedly left its actors battered and bruised after every performance, the film makes no attempt to open up the narrative and relies instead on a confined setting for the main action
Acing and technical credits are fine, though Fawcett's overly subdued performance won't play effectively to viewers who might be relying on her to provide an outlet for their outraged indignation
No redeeming features, this film is rubbish
The humour for children is pathetic, and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package
Sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next
Although my child for whom the DVD was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again, unlike with Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc
which all get frequent requests for replays
A very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting, but where the hell is the ending to this film?<br /><br />In fact, what is the point of it?<br /><br />The scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally, and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storyline
<br /><br />The performances of the cast are questionable, if not believable
<br /><br />Did I miss the conclusion somewhere in the film? I guess we have to wait for the sequel
This movie was so bad, outdated and stupid that I had rough times to watch it to the end
I had seen this Rodney guy in Natural Born Killers and I thought he was funny as hell in it, but this movie was crap
The "jokes" weren't funny, actors weren't funny, anything about it wasn't even remotely funny
Don't waste your time for this! Only positive things about this were the beautiful wives :) and Molly Shannon who I'm sure tried her best, but the script was just too awful
That's why I rated it "2" instead of "1", but it's definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen
I didn't really expect much from "The Night Listener" and I actually never heard of it until I saw the cover in the videostore
However, the movie is very effective when it comes to building up suspension and tension
On occasion it drags a little, but it actually helps to keep you wondering what's going to happen and more importantly: when
As the movie progresses, the character played by Robin Williams gets dragged into some kind of "cat and mouse" spiel to the point where he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and existence about a 14 year old abused kid that no-one seemed to have ever seen in person
The Night Listener is an interesting story, which is great in building up the suspense throughout the movie and you're pretty much kept in the dark of who is lying and what's real
However, in the end it kind of disappoints and doesn't live up to the potential it could have had
It doesn't really give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character, which would have been helpful and interesting
After seeing "Driven" on a plane flight to America 3 years ago I truly believed I had seen the worst film ever created, and I could relax safe in the knowledge I would never have to suffer that much in front of a screen ever again
Unfortunately as I found out last night this was not the case
Revolver is so monstrously bad I am actually thinking about recommending friends to go and see it, just so I don't feel like I'm the only one stupid enough for being conned into watching this
Its really quite amazing how much this film falls completely on its face with the constant, and I mean CONSTANT voice overs of the main characters, with totally inane pretentious nonsense! I was actually getting angry in the cinema listening to Andre Benjamin's utterly relentless droning for what seemed like half the film, whilst all the time thinking - what would Turkish have done to this complete joke of gangster/con man, whatever he's supposed to be, when he made his "offer"? I'll tell you what
He would have told him to f**k off, blown his head away, and watch with utter disdain as his equally inept partner waddles away as fast as his chubby little legs would carry him
I mean what are we supposed to believe is going through Jake's head when they offer him their "solution" to his problem? They're con men, therefore they must obviously also have the skill to cure incurable blood diseases! I mean ffs
Doesn't he start to wonder why his symptoms aren't getting worse? Doesn't the penny drop on the third day what is happening instead of Richie subjecting the audience to a painfully patronising phone call from Avi to Jake to let him know he's been conned
<br /><br />Anyway, I can add a small positive note to the film by moving on to the dry humour if provides, thankfully of a similar standard to his previous films
bulls**t! This film doesn't try anything as smart as redeeming itself through some well timed amusing lines, oh no
It somehow managed to be so disastrously unfunny I genuinely didn't hear so much as a titter from a completely packed cinema  and anyone who knows the UGC in Sheffield knows how full a main screen can get, and not 1 person so much as smiled
Maybe he never wanted the film to be funny, and fair enough you can still make good gangster films without comedy, but what was he planning on hanging this film on may I ask? The unnecessarily baffling plot!?? I sincerely hope not!<br /><br />By far the most satisfying moment I went through last night was hearing the very loud sighing coming from ALL directions of the audience as everyone desperately prayed for the film to end
It was also really quite amusing watching just how fast patrons were fighting and dashing for the exits after they realised it was over, and they were free from their torment!<br /><br />I'll round this off (I've got to finish, writing this is making me angry again) by elaborating on the "end"
no, sorry I can't, your just going to have to go and see it
It can't be put in words, it just can't, and after you've seen it you'll know why
at the beginning i was happy to know about a new superman movie , i though that will be great but it wasn't
<br /><br />is a bad copy of the Richard Donner work,Lex is again a villain that makes no more else , even played by Kevin spice
<br /><br />the evil plan is the same of the first movie of Donner just a lot forced
<br /><br />the script is predictable and simple (all stuff Luthor finds in a museum or an old lady)
<br /><br />the story is the wrong thing , it must be the Kevin Smith Script and may be it could be better
<br /><br />i just hope a sequel without Brian Singer and with a new talent director to do something new and not a copy
Well I must say this is probably the worst film I have seen this year! The jokes were extremely crude (wasn't expecting it from as PG movie)(Rated PG in Canada) and they weren't funny! With this great cast I at least expected some good acting but I didn't even get that
I am a huge Rainn Wilson fan and this is the first time I was extremely disappointed by his performance
Neither Luke Wilosn or Uma Thurman's characters are the least bit likable and i really could have cared less what happened to either of them
I didn't expect this at all as in the past I have really liked other movies by this director (Six Days, Seven Nights for example) This movie was NOT worth the $10 it cost me and i strongly encourage you not to see this movie
I guarantee that you will be like me begging for this movie to be over
This is kind of a weird movie, given that Santa Claus lives on a cloud in outer space and fights against Satan and his minions
whether all of them were intentional is certainly debatable, though
This movie is not good, but I can say I really enjoyed watching it
<br /><br />I would recommend this movie over "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians", "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or "The Santa Clause" with Tim Allen
Mona the vagabond lives on the fringes of French society, in a life without meaning, purpose or direction
<br /><br />I watched this because of all the stellar reviews, but I'm afraid I must have missed something
The character of Mona has little or no personality while drifting through life being rude to people, getting high and contributing nothing to anyone's life
<br /><br />I've seen and known enough people like that: there is no secret meaning to what they're doing
I wouldn't want Mona anywhere near me, as she tends to steal anything that isn't nailed down and leave her friends in the lurch
Sure she's enigmatic - because there isn't anything to her
Lots of junkies, winos and bums I've seen are enigmatic; I wouldn't want to see a film about them either
<br /><br />Possibly there is something there that I totally missed
Otherwise I'm assuming that all the reviews are from people who assume anything done by a French female director is high art
This movie was by far the worst movie that I have ever seen in my entire life
It was poorly made and the actors couldn't act
It looked like a movie that my friends and I could have put together on our own
The case the movie came in is definitely a disguise
Nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case
It appears that the director or make-up artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie
The credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie
Which watching the credits was the best part of the movie
This was honestly an awful movie and I couldn't believe how badly it was put together
Scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like "whats going on?" The audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teen's joking around making a fake fight scene
<br /><br />IF you are considering renting or buying this movie I would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show's how awful it truly is
I wish i would have watched it before i rented it
THERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS AHEAD, IF YOU CARE
*<br /><br />Okay, the basic premise of this homegrown Texas film is: College kids + spookhouse + evil magic book = scary stuff
In practice, it equals a lot of time looking at the time to see how much longer this movie is going to drag on
A bunch of frat boys, along with assorted girlfriends & volunteers, is setting up a charity haunted house
The project is being presided over by a thoroughly repellent character, whose main purpose seems to be verbally & physically assaulting as many cast members as possible
I had a hard time believing that anyone would even attempt to work with this person in any capacity: he's nothing but rude and abusive to everyone, including his girlfriend and his buddy
Regardless, the kids are visited by local character & annual pumpkin-carving champion "Pumpkin Jack", an elderly coot who is described as the "Santa Claus of Halloween", and who drops off a load of props for the house, including an ominous book that figured prominently in the irritatingly strobe-flashed prologue(where a gaggle of robed cultists get turned into stir-fry)
Needless to say, some damn fool starts messing with the book, and eventually most of the costumed monsters turn into real ones, and the remaining few normal folk have to try and survive
There's some good stuff in this film, but not much: everything is shot well, and the makeup effects are decent
On the other hand, the performers either underact, or overact drastically; much of the plot makes little sense outside of a "this happens so that can happen" series; there is hardly any musical score to speak of, just snatches of songs throughout the film; and the movie takes an hour to actually get anywhere
That last problem is the most telling: two-thirds of the 90 minute running time is used to repeatedly set up the characters
Tom is a nice guy dating Heidi the control freak, but he used to date Jill, who is now dating Dan the jerk, but she's started a relationship Kira the girl who wears too many shawls/capes
Dan is a really big jerk, Gary likes to play jokes, and Steve & Lily like to have a lot of sex
Stuff that could have easily been dealt with in 20 minutes or so drags on and on, to the point where the lesbian "sex" scene(calm down, it's pretty tame) left me looking for the fast forward button
That leaves us with half an hour of lo-calorie scares, a klunky ending and a deep-seated dislike of ol' Pumpkin Jack, who I blame for the whole mess
Unless you can get this on some sort of deep-discount rental(and really have seen everything else in the store), put it back on the shelf and keep looking
Ronald Reagan and a bunch of US soldiers in a North Korean POW camp
We learn North Korean Communists are bad people
We learn Americans' beards grow very slowly during days of torture
<br /><br />I tried to suppress it, but I finally burst out laughing at this movie
Reagan comes out from telling the Communists he wants to be on their side
Next, acting stone-cold sober, he takes a drunken companion, Dewey Martin, to get sulfur to cure Mr
Of course, the North Korean communist guard is as dumb as they come
So, the drunk distracts the guard while Reagan goes over to get something from a drawer, which is next to a bunch of empty boxes
I'm sure he boxes were supposed to contain something; but, of course, Reagan causes them to shake enough to reveal they are empty
Ya gotta laugh! I think "Prisoner of War" will appeal mainly to family and friends of those who worked on it - otherwise, it's wasteful
<br /><br />* Prisoner of War (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest, Dewey Marti
I saw "Paris Je T'Aime" because a friend really wanted to see it so I went along with him
Going in, I was indifferent about the film but leaving the theater I really regretted wasting 2 hours of my life sitting through this tepid production
The "stories" are almost completely forgettable except for the fact that most of them were awful
What do Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara have to do with Paris? The endless parade of American actors most definitely gave this French film a remarkably non-French feel
Yes, most of them were playing with clichés about Paris but by spending so much time making fun of French clichés, they directly and regrettably promoted them once more
<br /><br />The worst segments were: the one directed by Wes Craven (Oscar Wilde); the one with Nick Nolte; the mime one (the worst?); the hair products one; the one with Juliette Binoche (Willem Dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of Paris?); the vampire one (When I think of Paris I think of Elijah Wood)
The one with Natalie Portman, which really looked like a Mentos commercial and it was stupid (the blind young man should know Portman was just playing a part when she called him)
<br /><br />I didn't like the Coen Bros one as well
It really plays with those Parisien clichés but I didn't find it funny
The Gus Van Sant one was interesting but it was so slight (and the punchline was obvious) that it barely registered
<br /><br />There were only two "successful" segments and they were the one about the immigrant nanny who leaves her baby at a kindergarten only to babysit a baby for a rich woman
And the segment about the African who is stabbed
It's the best segment in the whole film but this segment has nothing to do with Paris
The story could have taken place in any city around the world
<br /><br />The last segment, the one with the chubby middle aged woman was sorta interesting too but the underlying tone was bad
They wanted to celebrate her limited grasp of French but the segment came off as being condescending
<br /><br />The whole project felt forced and uninspired
Almost like the French government sponsored this film to promote tourism
All in all, with only about 10 to 15 minutes of interesting stuff, "Paris Je T'Aime" was an awful cinematic experience
Beaudray Demerille(a weak Peter Fonda, who also directed), an aging gambler, wins young teen Wanda "Nevada"(pretty, but not talented Brooke Shields) in a poker game
Together the unlikely pair(of course)embark on a search for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon
<br /><br />That's the story and there really is no need to search for a deeper meaning in it
The acting is very weak too, which was quite a surprise given the fact that Peter Fonda was in the lead
<br /><br />If you're looking for something interesting in this film, take a look at the nice scenery and some good looks of a young Brooke Shields
Her character however is so irritating(especially at the beginning)and dumb, that she never quite comes off as sexy or appealing
Too bad, but, given the story, I doubt anything more could be made of this
I wonder why Peter Fonda directed and starred in this film
He must have even talked his father(Henry Fonda)into a (useless) cameo in this ridiculous mess
Unfortunately, this was their only film together
Couldn't Henry be in EASY RIDER for example? 3/1
I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I have ever watched
I would recommend this cartoon to people who are under 5
I did used to like this show when I was 4 and 5, I still only watched it when there was nothing on
Now I am other 5 and I would rather do my homework than watch it
The cartoon used to be a bit funny but they were not enough to make me burst out laughing
Now I am older I am interested in show witch are not rated Us
I have started to watch Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG)
I am interested in things to do with Doctor Who so I am not interested in 5 year old cartoons
This cartoon didn't last very long it only had 6 seasons, it got cancelled because of it was low on viewers but some people say it was because the writers ran out of ideas but for most other shows they have at least 8 seasons
Because 'cruel' would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these film makers
Where do you even begin? In a spout of b*tchiness, I'm going to start with the awful acting of nearly everybody in this movie
I can't think of even one character who was portrayed well
Although, in all fairness, it would be nearly impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way
Still, the girl who played Katherine (whose name I purposefully don't include - I'm pretending she doesn't exist) remains one of the worst actors I've ever seen, only eclipsed by the guy who played Sebastian
It attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways
Pretty much every part of it was pointless - though I will admit (grudgingly) that the plot twist was quite good it its surprise
And the ending was at least slightly humorous
But this film is up there with the worst I've seen
There is absolutely no value in watching it
It only takes away the enjoyment of the first
Fox's "The True Story Of Jesse James" (1957) is a remarkably poor widescreen remake of their prestigious 1939 Tyrone Power/Henry Fonda classic "Jesse James"
I'm not sure where the fault lies but the casting in this version of the two central characters, the uneven direction of Nicholas Ray and the ham-fisted screenplay must surely have something to do with it
<br /><br />In the late thirties and forties Tyrone Power was Fox's top leading man but in the fifties his star began to wane and studio head Darryl Zanuck started to groom newcomer Robert Wagner to take his place
This was a major error on Zanuck's part as Wagner proved to be a less than a suitable replacement
With the possible exceptions of "Broken Lance" (1954) and "Between Heaven & Hell" (1956) it is hard to think of Wagner distinguishing himself in anything! Also, Jeffrey Hunter was nothing more than a Fox contract player before being assigned to play Frank James to Wagner's Jesse in "The True Story Of Jesse James"
Borrowed from the studio the previous year this actor's one distinguishing mark was his excellent and revealing performance in John Ford's classic "The Searchers"
But his playing here, along with Wagner as the second half of the James Brothers, is nothing short of boring
Neither player bring any personality or colour to their respective roles
They totally miss the mark, lacking the charisma and appeal so vividly displayed by Power and Fonda in the original
The movie is also marred by too many flashbacks and with the all over the place screenplay Wagner, as the Robin Hood of the American west, comes across as a charmless introverted twit that you can feel no empathy for whatsoever
The supporting cast are hardly worth mentioning but it is a shame to see such a great actress as Agnes Moorhead barely getting a look in as Ma James
<br /><br />The best aspects of this uninvolving so-so western is the wonderful Cinemascope/Colour cinematography by the great Joe McDonald and the excellent music score by the underrated and little known composer Leigh Harline
Even less it was available at my local video store
<br /><br />Some argue this is a good movie if you take in consideration it had only a 4000$ budget
I would find it very bad whichever the budget
<br /><br />Still more funny, I read the following in another review: "Dramatics aside, if you love horror and you love something along the lines of Duel (1971) updated with a little more story and some pretty girls thrown in, you'll love this movie
"<br /><br />What?!? This is a shame comparing those two movies
<br /><br />I give a "1", since I can't give a "0"
I just don't see any way this movie could be entertaining
Bobby is a goofy kid who smiles far too much and wants sex
The acting is lame, the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely strung chain of clichés and cheap thrills
The makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there craziness of other films of the time, but fell a long way short
They even resort to Bobby slipping on a banana skin, because this will supposedly add comedic value
<br /><br />I'm struggling to find a redeeming feature of the film
If you like DeVito, this is another classic DeVito kind of role - but he's only a supporting actor and there for cliché value
there was more mystery to this movie then the first
Even when it ends your asking yourself what happened who was the killer
There are some good parts through the movie, the first half starts off slow and then in the last half the pace picks up
The story is 22 years after the events that occured in the first film, Norman Bates is out of an asylum and back to the Bates motel, but when a woman turns up claiming to be his real mother, things start going wrong
Perkins plays an aged Norman well again and the scene at the end was excellent, he swang that spade awfully hard
Mislead by the terrible lie on the cover, "fun as American Pie", my girlfriend and I sat in front of the TV waiting for a comedy
You probably won't laugh one time if you're not one of those Jackass-like ever-teeny minds
It's not even an erotic movie, which would at least been something, given that it's about sex
<br /><br />So, what is this? The erratic plot deals with a guy who wants to lose virginity (zero in originality, I remember "Losing it" for one) and his gang of friends
the girls) just come and go for no credible reason
Come on, there are even Dwarfs (so simple: "dwarves are fun ho ho"
) The acting is very TV-like (as is the video look throughout the movie) and definitely amateur in the case of most of the girls
Amateurish, badly produced, and over all NOT FUNNY
Kids and teens will love to watch it with friends because of the swearing and sex jokes
Other than that, don't even think of renting this movie
Will they ever make movies without nudity and sex? This came on at 3:00 on Sunday afternoon and I couldn't believe what they showed
Thank God my son was outside or I would have been freaked out if he had seen the soft/medium porn! Do people who make movies not care who they offend or corrupt? Kids could have been watching after church and that is what they show???!!! The acting was good and I enjoyed the suspense but GEE! There was violence and bad guys but that is to be expected in a western movie
If the writers, directors and producers would just quit putting on so much uncalled for sex scenes
What has to happen to get them to quit going in that direction? Where can I complain
I have to say this is an awful movie, for the mere fact that when you see this movie on the guide, it is listed as a documentary
As I watched it, I started laughing, thinking to myself, does this guy actually expect me to believe this is real? So I had to look it up, and now see that it is a movie, but now since it isn't a documentary, it is now a movie with bad acting
I am a NYC Police Officer, and felt that someone was trying to mislead people into thinking this is a documentary, with the intentions of making money off of a terrible day for me and my coworkers
Maybe I was blinded by that, and it isn't as bad as I personally think it is
Swedish action movies have over the past few years evolved into something that imitate American hardened action movies like "Heat" but with a low budget
This movie follows the same prescription as "Noll Tolerans" and "Livvakterna"
However, it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a cool and tough movie
<br /><br />The story has been seen before, the dialogue feels artificial and the acting is very poor, especially from the main actress
The movie tries to paint a picture of hard-boiled military-like robbers with no remorse at all and a female investigator who has completely lost it with problems of the past but at the same time acts completely rational
<br /><br />The bluish-cast photo style does not seem fresh anymore, and it is not even done well in this picture
Only a very few scenes actually look good
Also, the sound is quite weird and it sounds like a lot of the actual dialogue is recorded afterward
<br /><br />The main quality of this movie is Stefan Sauk, though not making a convincing portrait of a SWAT-team leader, has some really funny lines
When I was at the movie store the other day, I passed up Blonde and Blonder, but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie
Who knows? I mean, I'm sure most people bashed Romy and Michelle before they saw it, Blonde and Blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up
But when I started watching it: Executive Producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew I was in for something scary
Not only that, but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, not to offend them, but they were not aging well at all and they're playing roles that I think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their 20's, not their 40's
The story was just plain bad and obnoxious
<br /><br />Dee and Dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde's, they really don't have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world, it's just really sad
But when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins, the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their "ignorance is bliss" attitudes
They are set up to make a "hit" on a guy, and they think they're just going to "show him a good time", but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls
<br /><br />Denise and Pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before
I know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary
Would I ever recommend this? Not in a million years, the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as "sex kittens", it's more a sign of desperation and Blonde and Blonder is a huge blonde BOMBshell
This is without doubt Rajnikanth's worst movies ever
The first part is held in place with solid comedy from Goundamani but it progressively gets worse and worse and completely illogical
Our hero also takes a dig at Saints with the same name (Baba) through a corny and utterly lame one-liner
The first half has Rajni uttering his usual array of oneliners and style and in the second half, becomes a quasi saint after a beggar takes him through a interdimensional portal to the Himalayas where Babaji (not the famous Saints he took a dig at earlier) gives him special powers for no apparent reason (other than karma)
This is really starting to get interesting now isn't it? <br /><br />The rest of the movie is about him wasting his magic boons and powers and fighting off politicians and related black magic
The usual predictable crap with hilarious implementation
Oh and the black magic never worked on our hero because he just happened to have a Param Vir
The bad guys and the usual politician villains are clichéd, overworked and in the end, completely insignificant to the plot which itself doesn't go anywhere
<br /><br />But despite all the flaws, it was fun to kill time with and yell Baba related one-liners during public events
Its also fun to watch others curse about this movie
AR Rehman is said to have composed the tracks for his movie through the cell phone
<br /><br />Rajni is very popular in Japan and he has included two characters (one of them is called Keiko
why not Samsung?) of Japanese origin in this movie just for the sake of it
But the way they are portrayed, dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic
The Japanese may stop watching Rajni movies after seeing that
This movie was probably promotional material for Rajni entering politics but the results of the movie itself would have killed off any of his political dreams
<br /><br />Fun if you turn your brain off though
Great movie - especially the music - Etta James - "At Last"
This speaks volumes when you have finally found that special someone
The producers made a big mistake casting Mark Lester, who couldn't act or sing, in the title role
Aside from his very bad "acting", all of Lester's singing had to be dubbed by a girl
I don't know why they cast him at all, since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well
Shani Wallis was far too old to play Nancy, who was only supposed to be 16
The current West End version is so much better than the movie in every way
Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than Jack Wild ever was
It was clearly political to award this old-fashioned musical so many Oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968
I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules: This movie is aweful! From the acting to the non-realistic animation to the countless errors
I was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination (can't extend flaps without engines)
The landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity
That tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear
The one thing I thought was quite peculiar is when they landed, the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off, thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air
How did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that weren't touching the ground? Did they forget the spoilers? Word to the director: Find out *all* you can about planes before attempting a "plane" movie
Sorry for the technical rant, but I give this movie 1/10
yeah, this film steals a LOT from 'Darkness Falls' (2003)
The plot for 'Darkness Falls' goes something like this: The Tooth Fairy, a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement kills people who look at her out of revenge
In 'The Tooth Fairy' (2006), the disfigured Tooth Fairy (who, yeah, hides her face) unleashes her furious vengeance on just about anyone
<br /><br />But, what must be asked is this: If you're going to directly steal the exact plot from a movie, why choose something as mediocre as 'Darkness Falls'? Sure it made a few bucks at the box office, but that was strictly for the fairly okay theatrical experience the film delivered
A low-budget, straight-to-video movie will not have that same effect
<br /><br />As I watched the opening 15-20 minutes of the film, my expectations actually rose
There seemed to be at least SOME production value
The story didn't seem terrible, just blatantly ripped off
Past the first scene, we get an okay cast of characters including an ex-doctor with secrets (played by that guy who looks like a Busey) and some hot veterinary student (Jenifer from Argento's 'Masters of Horror: Jenifer')
After those few minutes, however, the film just slowly goes down the drain
It serves all the basic horrible clichés including, but not limited to: some crazy old person with an unheeded warning, the buff dumb jock, the psychic, and the stripper with the heart-of-gold
<br /><br />One of the biggest problems this film had was its inability to stick with a target audience
It's kind of like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for whatever character was on screen at the time
When the adults were on screen, it had a more mature feel
When Star (the stripper) and whatshisface (the jock) were on screen, the dialogue went down to a more stupid, err immature, level
When the kid was on screen, it felt like an episode of 'Are You Afraid of the Dark?'
<br /><br />Technically, the film is all over the place
The visuals range from fairly good to plain boring
The writing is subpar, as is the acting for the most part
On the plus side, there's some excessive gore at parts (including a fairly cool (yet painfully predictable)) woodchipper scene and a pretty vicious nailgun scene
Also, if you're looking for a bit of the sexy stuff, there's a brief topless scene (but if you want to see this chick topless, there are better films to do that)
Other than that, there's not much to bother with when it comes to this film
<br /><br />If you're a huge fan of 'Darkness Falls' (do those exist?), maybe you can check it out to see the story done in a different way
but, that's about the only reason I can find to see this one
Before I watched this film I read a review here stating that this film could possibly be one of the best films ever!? ha ha Scene by scene the tension grows alright
from the annoying characters in this movie
From the little girl talking gibberish and trying to drown the little boy, to the killer just running about without any notice (and who was the guy at the beach talking to the little boy!?)
things just seem to happen and then go unanswered in this film
As I watched it seemed like the film was going in one direction, then just doesn't go anywhere, but into a new direction
<br /><br />The acting is great, but the writing is horrible
Each character, in each scene, says or does something so unbelievable, unrealistic and the reactions of the fellow cast/extras are simply strange
There are no resolutions to the problems developed throughout the film, making it confusing and ultimately a big waste of time
First of all, I am not a huge fan of contemporary Turkish cinema, which is because, the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline
This movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos, as the director and marketing ads imply
In my mere opinion, the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale(in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country) Cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what I meant
<br /><br />However, the acting is near perfect
In fact, most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what Altioklar lacked; talent! All members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job, even the less experienced ones
(Like Janset) At least, Altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation , just because he knows well how to choose the cast
Other than that, he is just a media monkey, who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent
Come on, art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked/half naked women
And just because media boasts off, no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema
Just close your ears and o something real artistic, I am waiting eagerly to applause your next work
Hope, this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach
<br /><br />In short; Pros > Good acting, hot women (just kidding!) :) Cons> Each and every single thing, other than the cas
Jack Black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing, but in this movie
<br /><br />Besides the direction, writing, lack of plot, constant mugging (aided and abetted by constant straight-on camera shots), and a
050 joke batting average, it was still an utter waste of time
The idea sounds promising, but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction I've seen this side of you-tube
<br /><br />I kept hearing that this film portrayed Mexicans very negatively
While that's no doubt true, I really don't think this movie is meant to be racist
I think that's it's more a result of a "creative" team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess
You can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera: "Hey look, it's an ugly Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, for the love of all things tenacious, LAUGH!"<br /><br />But put the racism charges aside
When you get down to it, it's anyone who plunked down good money and time to watch this pile of leftover refried beans that should be offended, IMO
OK, If you're looking for another Bastketball Diaries, this is completely the wrong film
<br /><br />I revolves around two brothers
Max, the younger, has a major cocaine addiction
This movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible
It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present
Most of the movie focus is on Max and his parting ways
Eventually Adam, can no longer take the stress from his job and begins to use as well (perscription drugs)
<br /><br />This movie has almost no climax
Doesn't descend into what cocaine really does to you, has boring and low-budget scenes, and the acting of the eldest brother, Adam, is horrific
<br /><br />I have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards, it is not a heart-wencher
If you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs- rent, if not buy 'The Basketball Diaries'
<br /><br />Try to avoid this movie but, if you think you will enjoy
I don't like using the word "awful" to describe any work of the cinema for which a great deal of time, effort, talent and money is spent in its creation but Zefferelli's attempt to adapt Charlotte Brontë's novel 'Jane Eyre' is a total waste of time
<br /><br />The script is lacking in finesse and power, everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms, leaving little to the imagination
The lead actors are woefully miscast, clearly hired for their star names, and the musical score drippy and dull
Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all
She is like a wet noodle, worse even than Joan Fontaine, who at least was capable of some modicum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion
And William Hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy
Of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any whiff of life to this flick
<br /><br />Joan Plowright's Mrs Fairfax is like some Disney creation who keeps popping up to sweeten scenes in which she would have been best left out
<br /><br />There is no mystery surrounding the story of Rochester's first wife
The role of the would-be second wife, played like a Barbie Doll by Elle MacPhearson, is an empty cipher
<br /><br />Fiona Shaw, a very great actress, is completely wasted as Jane's Aunt, Mrs Reed
She would have been better-cast as Mrs Fairfax
Only Amanda Root, as Jane's beloved school teacher, evokes any authentic sympathy or believability
<br /><br />I saw this version of 'Jane Eyre' after viewing Robert Young's for British television, made in 1997, starring Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones
Young's vital, romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova compared to Zefferelli's wet squib
<br /><br />I will be interested now to see the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton, about which I've read some very good things on this web-site
I am amazed at how many people liked Zefferelli's Yorkshire picture book
<br /><br />About all I can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored, beyond that it is a complete dud
I'm not going to approach and critique the theories of RAW
I mean, this is a site about movies and whether the movie delivers or is well-made, and not a site debating philosophy
<br /><br />Having said that, this video really blows
It's one talking-head shot of RAW after another
Some of it is archival video, so you can see how he has aged over the years, and that's pretty cool
But, otherwise, the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous
<br /><br />It's a strange comparison, but I kept thinking of the Sunday afternoon when I watched some of the Barbra Streisand star vehicle *Funny Lady* (another really bad movie)
After a while, I was so OD'd on Barbra, I kept wishing there would be one scene that she wouldn't appear in: you know, a "meanwhile, other characters in the movie were up to something else
<br /><br />So, if your idea of a good time is to look at multiple takes and angles of the face of RAW while he prattles on with his theories, assembled in a lame structure that doesn't add any interest or insight, then be my guest
For me, I couldn't take it after 20 minutes
I'm a big fan of horror flicks, and zombie films are a particular favorite of mine
That said, Zombi 3 is one of the absolute worst films I have ever seen
So needless to say I really enjoyed it, it's the best bad movie I've seen in a long while
The story has some similarities with Dan O'Bannon's "Return of the Living Dead", but whereas that film was intentionally funny, this one is the opposite
It has some of the most laughable acting I've ever witnessed, especially from the main scientist character
His scenes with the General were just hysterical
Also, the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy, and the death scenes are often just downright stupid
This, of course, makes it all the more fun
POSSIBLE SPOILER - The worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head, which then opens its eyes and somehow FLIES OUT OF THE FRIDGE (obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string), latching onto the guys neck, killing him
Zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now? It defies every law of physics known to man, and it's one of the most absurd things ever filmed
That's just one of many really goofy moments in the idiotic mess
I can't believe it's gotten so high a rating here
If you are a fan of bad movies, do yourself a favor and rent this sucker
I had to register for IMDb just to post a comment on just how awful this movie is
my cats and a ball of string have a better storyline than this
Not the worst acting I've ever seen, but when you wipe out almost the entire cast of the movie within 5 minutes, it leaves a bit to be desired
There wasn't a single 'scare' moment in the movie, with the exception of when they were watching the movie 'Halloween' on the TV
All around, it seems like it could've been a good story, rolling the credits and saying that Chasey Lain was in it was a bit of a loss as I didn't recognize her right away and her scene was already over before I could've said 'oh yeah, there she is'
I'm so glad I saw this in a hotel and didn't pay for it as I'd be real ticked if I had payed a cent to see this
I normally like or can at least find a redeeming factor in a movie, but this one is an exception
It's so bad that it's not even that amusing so-good-it's-bad
The movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike - but are not in any way expect for being smart - one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code
Geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the title
<br /><br />I honestly didn't like the style of the movie
I believe that anxiety, confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose, but what I don't get is why there is so much of it
The movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all
However it's visually numbing the viewer, it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs, monotonic scenes, dynamic cut, music and abrupt noises
<br /><br />The movie's storyline is very simple, most of what's going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes, mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cuts
<br /><br />I will say openly that this movie didn't meet my expetations a tiny bit
This 1973 remake of the classic 1944 Billy Wilder film, "Double Indemnity," is a textbook example of how to destroy a great script
This grade-B TV fodder also illustrates the folly of remakes in general
While Hollywood has gone after greedy executives that colorize black-and-white films and sought disclaimers on wide-screen movies that are shown in pan-and-scan versions, the industry has ignored the hacks that insist on taking a classic film and diminishing it with a shoddy remake
<br /><br />The first step in producing a bowdlerized version of a classic is to edit the script
The Billy-Wilder-Raymond-Chandler work was cut by a half hour to fit the finished film into a specified time-slot with room for commercials
Then update the production with bland, color photography, smart, upscale sets, and TV-familiar actors
Thus, the brand-new "Double Indemnity" eliminates the atmospheric black-and-white film-noir cinematography that enhanced the mood and characterizations of the original
Gone are the dusty, shadowy, claustrophobic sets that explained the protagonists' desires to escape their situations at whatever cost
Gone are the close bond between Keyes and Neff and the erotic attraction between Neff and Phyllis
<br /><br />The look of Jack Smight's take on "Double Indemnity" is more "Dynasty" than film noir
Phyllis Dietrickson has a designer home to die for, and Neff's comfy pad would be hard to afford on an insurance salesman's salary, not to mention the sporty Mercedes convertible that he drives
Neither character has any apparent motive to murder for a paltry $200,000
If not money, then perhaps murder for love or lust? Not in this version
Richard Crenna shows little interest in Samantha Eggar, and their kisses are about as lusty as those between a brother and a sister
Crenna fails to capture the cynicism of Neff, and his attempts at double-entendre and sexual suggestiveness fall horribly flat
Eggar is little better and lacks sensuality and the depth to suggest the inner workings of a supposedly devious and manipulative mind
Cobb manages a creditable performance as Keyes
Director Jack Smight and his three principals have all done much better work
<br /><br />There was no conceivable reason to produce this wretched remake except to fill time in a broadcast schedule
There was no conceivable reason to resurrect this dud on DVD and package it with the original film except to fill out a double-disc package
The only lesson that can be learned from this misfire is that even a great script and great dialog can be ruined with poor casting, lackluster direction, and TV grade production values
The 1973 "Double Indemnity" should be titled "10% Indemnity," because viewing it only underscores the 100% perfection of the original movie
<br /><br />I could ignore the poor effects, the often atrocious music, the cringe-inducing lines
I could ignore the unexplained events, and the fact that the movie constantly relies on deus ex machina is excusable, given the subject matter
I could ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are the bad guys
What kills this movie is that it's just plain and simple boring
Nothing actually happens; almost all scenes in the movie are designed to push the movie creators' morals on the viewers, at the cost of actually having a coherent story, or any kind of suspense
<br /><br />If you're looking for an entertaining B-movie, look elsewhere
Apparently, the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so-called "movie
" They described "blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence
" I instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie
" At least, I saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with "impervious" skin--but here I am perhaps revealing too much of the "plot
" Furthermore, as a viewer of many and sundry films (some of which include the occasional kung fu movie), I can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable
Whatever you may choose to do, I will always remain<br /><br /> Correct,<br /><br /> Jonathan Tanner <br /><br /> <br /><br />P
Poor script, every vampire cliché in the book is used, and no sympathy is given at all to the origins of the main character
There have been some truly brilliant Dracula/vampire movies in the past, but this doesn't even make it into the "dire" slot
<br /><br />Take a selection of people who seem to have dropped out of a teen-slasher move, add a dribble of Dracula Lore and mix in a heady tonic of religious/surreal day-dreaming
and you get a confusing mess of a film - Dracula 2000
<br /><br />I really cannot find any good things to say about this movie, as if it wasn't bad enough that it was made in the first place, they seem to have made Johnny Lee Miller effect an English accent
Whats the problem with that I hear you cry
Well, he is English, but he sounds like an American trying to do an English accent
<br /><br />All in all you may as well say your money (if you were thinking of buying it), or rent it out, watch it, and discover for yourself why it's about as scary as the Tellytubbies
Seriously, I mean very seriously, when I first started watching the show I thought it was good
The storyline were either too boring or predictable
George isn't always funny, he sometimes acts stupid
His mom is the silliest character of the show
How can a mother treat her own son that way, okay if it was the daughter in law, but this was her own son
I give this show a 4/10 just because the first few shows were a little funny
The actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha do a great job
Don't know how these shows get to play for so long
<br /><br />If you're really bored like I was and have nothing else to watch, I'd suggest you watch this
"Dracula II:Ascension" is the story of a group of medical students who come across the body of Dracula
When a mysterious stranger appears and offers the students $30 million to harvest the body and steal its blood for auction,it's an offer they can hardly refuse
Soon the students also find themselves relentlessly pursued by a vampire killer from the Vatican!"Dracula II:Ascension" is a slightly entertaining horror film that has many flaws
The characters are one-dimensional and the acting is pretty average
There are some good gore effects like really cool double decapitation scene,but there is not enough violence for my liking
The film becomes quickly boring and forgettable and there is absolutely no suspense
So if you like modern vampire flicks give it a look
I prefer atmospheric vampire chillers from 60's and early 70's like "Lips of Blood","The Brides of Dracula" or "Lemora:A Child's Tale of Supernatural" to name only a few
Carrie Fisher has stated on more than one occasion that she made this movie during a period of her life when she had a heavy cocaine problem, and she doesn't remember very much of it
That would explain why she made this film, but it doesn't explain why anyone else in the cast or crew did; I can't believe that EVERYBODY had a coke problem
This has to be one of the absolute worst movies ever made, and that's saying something
The blame can't be laid at the feet of "director" Tim Kincaid or "writer" Buddy Giovinazzo, as it is obvious that this picture wasn't written or directed by anyone
Apparently it just spontaneously came together, as there is little evidence of coherency, consistency, design, plot, sense, intelligence or anything else
What is really amazing is that there were some actual professionals who were involved in this glop
Co-star Robert Joy has done good work in other films, and composer Jimmie Haskell and cinematographer Arthur Marks are both industry veterans, Marks also having been a director, and not a bad one
Why they got involved in this steaming pile of offal is beyond comprehension
Tim Kincaid, the alleged "director", has made quite a few low-rent sci-fi and horror films, and, having seen most of them, I can tell you that not a one of them is any good
This one, though, is by far the worst thing he's ever done, and that is a major accomplishment on his part
Everything, absolutely EVERYTHING, about this movie is 12th-rate--at best
The cinematography is terrible, the acting is laughable, the "special effects" make "Plan 9 From Outer Space" look like "Spider-Man", the story is trite, derivative and stupid
Don't waste your time even looking at the video box cover, let alone renting it
The easiest way to describe this movie is as a satire
The target of the satire is quite vast, from the US Government to corporate America
It is also not a stinging satire, but rather a silly one
<br /><br />Think of this movie as a mix between the Kentucky Fried movie, Airplane and Police Squad series, done with a much smaller budget and not as funny
I can see how this movie is a satire of many sci-fi disaster movies from the 50's and 60's
I see this movie as a big influence on Tim Burton's Mars Attacks
Genetically engineered giant tomatoes go "crazy" and start attacking people and cities
At first there is a cover up and then it blows over into full blown war
<br /><br />The movie runs the gamut of characters and characterizations : Lois "Fairchild" (a Lois Lane clone), a very ambitious Presidential Press Secretary, Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (FIA agent who hasn't worked since the Bay of Pigs), a useless President (who only seems to be able to sign his name and attack New York), an even inept Congress, a sleazy marketing CEO, and Mason's team consisting of an obese East German "female" swimmer, a scuba diver, a crazed WWII paratrooper and an African-American disguise expert (disguised as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler and finally as a tomato)
Did I also forget to mention, lots and lots of tomatoes? There are all kinds of tomatoes from small tomatoes, to giant plastic tomatoes, to smashed tomatoes, to tomato juice and finally to people dressed up as tomatoes
<br /><br />On top of all this, you have a couple of musical numbers as well
They aren't that good and seem to be dubbed
The best tune is by far the theme of the movie ("Attack of the Killer Tomatoes")
It is way too catchy and you might end up humming or singing it in public
<br /><br />Most of the movie is quite amusing and shows the absurdity of various real life situations as well as various entertainment genres
I don't believe I was induced to laughter, but mostly smiled and scratched my head
I definitely recommend this movie for fans of B and C grade movies, but only as a rental
A mix of Ninja stuff mixed with a sub-James Bond storyline
The result is incredibly awful and boring, being just the stage for endless gun battles
I can't believe this was released in theaters
Men In Black 2 was a real disappointment for me
While the actors did a pretty good job, especially Smith, there just isn't a cure for a poor script once in production
The movie really had a "sequel" kind of feel, playing off partial events of the first film
It wasn't thought out well, and seemed very choppy and incoherent at times
<br /><br />In the first flick, the MIB Organization had a kind of "elite" force feel
You had a few special agents, and it had a "clandestine" kind of feel to it
In the sequel, the MIB Organization has a JROTC Summer Camp vibe
<br /><br />The movie wasn't terrible or anything
it just lacked the "coolness" (for lack of a better phrase) of the first movie
A lot of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second, and didn't really add any originality to the MIB Universe
<br /><br />A perfect analogy would be Episode 1 to the first 3 films
Is it worthy of bearing it's title? Not really
"Look, I know this may suck right now, but pain is temporary, film is forever
Whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come
"  Robert De Niro<br /><br />This was initially a film for Steven Spielberg, the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay so that it more suited his themes
And so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison Robert De Niro
Like "Jurassic Park", "Poltergeist" and "War of the Worlds", the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast, the beast being the creation of the father, a lawyer who failed to defend De Niro during his trial
<br /><br />In typical Spielberg fashion, the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins
Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise and virtually every "daddy" figure in Spielberg land, the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that Spielberg so enjoys
<br /><br />But Spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to Martin Scorsese, who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare
The result is arguably the worst film in Scorsese's filmography, and, ironically, his most illuminating
<br /><br />An artist's failures or misfires are often very revealing, exposing the inner workings of their art
When the story doesn't work, the characters don't connect or the images don't sear, we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core
This  the remaining carcass- is what the director's cinema is about
<br /><br />Now "Cape Fear" is an impersonal film, so we won't find any thematic connections to the rest of Scorsese's filmography ("You already sacrificed me!" De Niro yells, but the films themes of Catholic redemption are cookie cutter)
What the film does, though, is expose the kind of language that his filmography hinges on
Watch how Scorsese's camera desperately whips back and forth, how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention
But more importantly, watch how the film makes no spatial sense
A showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound-stage, a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the family's house doesn't seem to exist anywhere in particular
There is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture, Scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of spatial environment
<br /><br />The reason for this is that Scorsese's camera always has to be bound, or intimately tethered, to his central character
For the world around the character to make sense, his camera has to be focused on the character
Resnais can take you around a French Hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building, Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic, Scott can recreate an entire future cityscape, Lucas can give you an alien desert planet, and most other directors can create a sense of space by textbook "close up-mid shot-wide shot" combinations, but Scorsese can't do this
There's no poetry, no sense of tangible space in his films
You break that tether, you leave that boxing ring, that taxi cab, you look away from De Niro, and everything collapses
He simply cannot break away from this very documentarian style of shooting, which, in a way, is a prerequisite for action film-making
<br /><br />Scorsese tried to rectify this problem with "Gangs of New York", where the space and the sets become the central character, but even this self consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of Daniel Day Lewis, the actor drawing Scorsese's camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb
<br /><br />5/10  Even as a generic B-movie, this is an ugly, vulgar looking film
Look at the matte paintings, the inept attempts at tension, the silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown
Still, we have Robert De Niro to pick up the slack
De Niro, who gives his body over to Scorsese like a tattooed Christ, gives the film its only great scene
In an improvised romantic sequence with young a Juliette Lewis, he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her
A kind of symbolic rape, the girl runs away, both aroused and repelled by this man's interest
<br /><br />But De Niro's performance, so deliciously over the top, simply can't be imitated by Scorsese
You'd need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like De Palma to make this work
There are some nice shots in this film, it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact the cinematography is probably it's best asset
<br /><br />But it's basically more of a made for TV movie, and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot, which keeps it quite interesting viewing, there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in Spanish, so non Spanish speakers will be left a little lost
<br /><br />I had it as a Xmas gift, as it's a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was just awesome in "A Time to kill" , and the "The Newton Boys " so I expressed I wanted to see more of his work
<br /><br />However although it says on the DVD box it is a Matthew Mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy, he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film, he is basically an extra and he doesn't exactly light up the screen while he is on, so die hard fans, really not worth it from that point of view
<br /><br />The films star though, Patrick McGaw is great though and very easy on the eye, and his character is just so nice and kind and caring, a true saint of a guy, he'd be well written into a ROM com
<br /><br />So for true Mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones I've seen, I'd recommend, "A Time to kill" , "The Newton Boys " "Frailty", "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days", "Edtv" and "Amistad" and avoid too "Larger Than Life" and "Angels in the Outfield" unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent, but are quite amusing films for children, again MM is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines
<br /><br />As for Scorpion Springit's not a bad film but it also isn't screen stealing either
I cannot stay indifferent to Lars van Trier's films
I consider 'Breaking the Waves' nothing less than a masterpiece
I admired the idea in 'Dogville' but the overall exercise looked to me too dry and too theatrical, less cinema
'Europa' which I see only now was a famous film at its time, succeeded in the US the relative success of an European film and got the Oscar for the best foreign language movie, but did not survive well the time in my opinion
It is also a too much explicit and extrovert exercise in cinema art to my taste
<br /><br />The story has a level of ambiguity that cannot escape the viewer
Treating the period that immediately followed the second world war not in the black and white colors of victors and vanquished, of executioners and victims but as rather ambiguous times when people of both sides were fighting for survival in the aftermath of a catastrophic event that change the lives of nations and individuals forever is still a source of disputes even today, more such was novel and courageous two decades ago
Yet it is the means of expression that really do not appear fit to the task
<br /><br />The film seems to include a lot of quotes descending directly from the films of Hitchcock, especially his early films set in the pre-war Europe, with brave British spies fighting evil German spies on trains crossing at high speed the continent at dark
The trains were a symbol of the world and its conflicts with all their intensity and dramatism
Here the train also becomes the symbol of the first sparkles of the re-birth of Germany after war, of its might, of its obsession with order and regulation, of punctuality and civility
The characters that populate the train are far from being the classical spy stories good or bad guys
The principal character a young American of German origin coming to post-war Europe willing to be part of a process of help and reconciliation finds himself in an ambiguous world of destruction and corruption, with liberators looking more like oppressive occupiers, with the vanquished not resigned to their fate but rather willing to continue on the path of self-destruction, with love doubtfully mixed with treason
<br /><br />It is yet this classical film treatment that betrays the director in this case
The actions of the characters, especially of Leopold Kessler played by Jean-Marc Barr seem confused, and lack credibility
The overall cinematography seems to be not Hitchcock-like but rather from a bad imitation of Hitchcock in the late 30s
The usage of color over the black-and-white film used in the majority of the time in moments of emotional intensity is also too demonstrative
It is not that Van Trier does not master his artistic means, but he is too demonstrative, he seems to try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is
He really is great, as he will show in some of his later films, but it will be left to the viewers to decide this alone
Woody Allen made "September", proving that even a genius could screw up
Monumentally stupid, boring, and unfunny, I must confess I did not watch it through to the end
The flick ranks among the dishonored few (e
, "The Money Pit", "Out to Sea", "Spitfire Grill") which either put me to sleep or forced me to reach for the "rewind" button
And I say this, sadly, as a devoted Mel Brooks fan
He should stick to straight comedy and leave social commentary alone
How the same fellow that made "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs" could crank out a dog like this is beyond me
Even by B-movie standards this movie is dreadful
The main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for anything are cool and worth admiring
People who treat others with respect are losers
Guncrazy is a movie that speaks for the disenfranchised a lot better than this movie, see it instead
<br /><br />No normal kid would do what Trent does
State Troopers do not work as they do in this film etc
Seeing this movie makes you realize why writers use the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold cliche
Mija is a completely unsympathetic hooker,who yes, has had a terrible life
However, she is such a terrible person the audience cannot identify with her
<br /><br />Usually there is one thing a movie can be recommended for, in this case there is none
It is such a ridiculous movie it insults the person who tries to identify with the main characters
The acting is adequate by B-movie standards and the direction presents nothing new or interesting
I really wanted to like this movie, but it was just imposable
The acting was ultra hammy, the plot was annoying, and the pace was SLOW, sooo slowwwwww
The whole time sitting in the theater i wanted the movie to end
Twenty minuets into a films and I'm praying for an ending
Sure some of the visuals were nice, but c'mon guys, I mean really! And for a movie about a guy tuning magical instruments there really wasn't much music to speak of
The music there was was annoying, and boring
There were sound loud shrill sounds at times too, those were also annoying
Mainly this film managed to bore me, and creep me out at the same time
I need to go see "Tideland" and wash this bad taste out of my mouth
I'm not sure why Spike Lee made this train wreck of a movie and conned poor Stevie Wonder into eternally pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess
I also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional Blacks
The abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame
Scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes, play as if some college kid wrote this
I especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up Snipes
The overacting of the leads makes one feel as if Spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about
The final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in
This movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the F-word in casual conversation
I am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker
I think his union with Scorcesee in Clockers was a wise move
He should stick to making documentaries like the Four Little Colored Girls
This was a real big mess that just couldn't help itself
Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29 year old man still living with his mum (Diane Keaton) and not planning on going anywhere
Until his mother meets a rich businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels) who she may be getting married to
<br /><br />It would have been an OK movie if Heder didn't play his Jeffrey so annoying, from the very start there is no chance of liking him and it only gets worse and worse
In the end, we are supposed to like him, but there was no reason to as he hadn't changed from the selfish brute that he was at the beginning of the movie
<br /><br />Keaton doesn't look to even be trying and is in horrible form after 2007's Because I Said So
Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and where supposed to believe that their mother and son? The only saving grace is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris although they don't look very interested either
Apart from a few little smiles, this film really doesn't deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is barely anything to laugh at! If your in the mood for a recent Diane Keaton flick watch Mad Money or Smother which are a lot better than this abysmal effort
Near the closing stages of Baby Mama, one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it 'was all just a mess'; I really couldn't say it any better than that
And while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again, the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone's time
A lacklustre cast, mundane script and vague, caricature characters ensure that Baby Mama certainly isn't taxing on the ol' noggin, but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour
Consisting mainly of very routine, cliché jokes based around an odd couple (rich and poor) trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world, the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic
<br /><br />As a story on finding love, it's not that bad, but playing this plot line as a side-story of sorts to work alongside the comedy-orientated odd couple tangent, characterisation is notably weak, resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles
As characters themselves, both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces, but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness; so while we may eventually come to find the character's interactions with each other amusing at times, the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles; we don't feel for the characters and don't find them inherently interesting, but rather their dynamic
Unfortunately however, although this dynamic works best, or at least better than the individual personas, as mentioned above, it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd-couple formula
<br /><br />Kate (Tina Fey) is a successful business woman who has hired working class, dumb-blonde Angie (Amy Poehler) to be her unlikely surrogate, and after Angie decides to leave hopeless husband Carl (Dax Shepard), both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences
Yes, it's the typical odd-couple premise, and one that we have already seen in this year's What Happens in Vegas, yet what Baby Mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi-layered characters
Kate and Angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air
In fact, the movie's only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of Romany Malco who gets lumbered with playing a door-man
Of the few times that I laughed during Baby Mama, most of those moments were because of this man, and the remainder usually fell to Shepard
<br /><br />It's a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script's themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera, and yet director Michael McCullers goes from page to screen effectively enough
Yet, for a film about babies, multi-million dollar business and cultural stereotyping, this isn't necessarily a good thing
Baby Mama is grade-A, hammy, plastic tinsel-town with capital bore topped with sugar
So not only did I feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two-dimensional nature, but I simply didn't care for the world they inhabited
The dialogue, along with sets, costumes, and the script's general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director's incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy; these aren't characters and that isn't our world in any way so why should I care? At the end of the day however, a romantic comedy's ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests, and the frequency of its laughs; Baby Mama has little going on in any of these departments
Of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair
I'm sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character Kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings, but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored
In this respect Baby Mama avoids being unbearable, but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience; a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch, Baby Mama is too light-headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining
<br /><br />- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www
It plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s/80s and puts it into a school context
I'm not saying that urban crime wasn't a problem for a lot of people or that schools weren't/aren't problem areas but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit
Violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it's not a case of social issues but a white, upper-middle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol
And of course he knows how to play the system
This turd is pure violent exploitation, a really nasty piece of work
It's disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment
This belongs in the same category as trash like Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on and so on
The only remarkable thing is that Michael Fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this
i saw the film and i got screwed, because the film was foolish and boring
i thought ram gopal varma will justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole film got spoiled and they spoiled "sholay"
the whole theater slept while watching the movie some people ran away in the middle
amithab bachan's acting is poor, i thought this movie will be greatest hit of the year but this film will be the greatest flop of the year,sure
nobody did justice to their work, including Ajay devagan
Swayze doesn't make a very convincing Alan Quatermain
Compared to Stewart Granger; which growing up was my ultimate hero in films like the 1952 "Scaramouche", the 1952 "Prisoner of Zenda" and the 1950 "King Solomon's Mines"; Patrick Swayze fails utterly
Even the portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" was very good in an otherwise big flop
Also Alison Doody lacks the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of the leading lady, and last but not least the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa makes it very hard for anyone to fill his (shoes)!!! For someone who was disappointed by Richard Chamberlain's 1985 version, I now highly recommend it if you can't get your hand on the granger version
This film is so much of a rip-off of the masterpeice "demons" and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching
The acting is terrible,the action scenes are speeded up,the script is almost painful and budget non existent
<br /><br />If you think this film is good then you havn't seen a real horror film, skip this and get a copy of the movie demons
Revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films since, in fact, most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events
Unfortunately, what this film lacks in drama is compensated for by an overabundance of boredom
One cares not who wins, loses, dies or lives--just end it as soon as possible
This is due in large measure to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology
Scenes of Paris and the French countryside have a cardboard quality about them
They might better be done on a bare stage and left that way
One cannot expect the amazing effects of "The House of the Flying Daggers" or "The Golden Compass," but , after all, this is a 2002 digitally mastered production
Characters seem to enter a scene for the sake of entering a scene, so much so that one loses count of the number of times character enter and leave rooms
In my view, this film turns the French Revolution of the 1790s into the "papier-mache" revolution of a "papier colle" world
Considering how much money was budgeted for this film, you would expect more from the story as a whole
This could be quite possibly the most worthless movie I have ever watched
There was no real advancement of anything
I'm not sure what points were even trying to be made
If you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys, American CIA bombs everything that doesn't agree with our opinions, all capitalists are corrupt, and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death, have at
For those of us who realize that it doesn't take killing off a good guy to make a point, we'll stick to other movies
In summary, this was a horrible attempt at an 'Ocean's 11' style hide-the-plot-so-person-has-to- think movie because not only do you not know what's going on, nobody who made the movie did either
Home Alone 3 was a better cinematic piece
I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it, so it seemed promising
And it was, until Justin Timberlake came on scene
He is a really bad actor and shouldn't be allowed to make a movie ever again
I mean, he is one of the most boring, uninspired actors I've ever seen
He puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever
Why the hell was he cast for the role of Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice
<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment
His character is so dull, it seems like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en
It might sound cool, but believe me, it's not
<br /><br />Now, Dylan McDermott's acting is very good
It's about one of the very few good things about this movie
<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special
<br /><br />About the story, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good
I was expecting a big twist when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but nothing really happened
I have just watched the movie for the first time
I wanted to watch it as I like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies
<br /><br />The movie is about a girl (played by young and beautiful Drew Barrymore), who moves from NYC to LA in order to get over her recently troubled loss
Short after moving to a guy who falls in love with her, it becomes obvious that she has an evil twin=doppelganger, who haunts her
<br /><br />The movie is quite poor and lousy
Both the dialogs and the acting make the film not really worth seeing it
Summing up it is just something for the fans of Drew Barrymore
Have not watched kids films for some years, so I missed "Here Come the Tigers" when it first came out
(Never even saw "Bad News Bears" even though in the '70s I worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie, "Warriors," "Man Who Would Be King," and "Rocky Horror Picture Show," among others
) Now I like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on
Just minutes into this movie I could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things--at least watching for his/her appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting weren't doing the job
Lo and behold, I spied Wes Craven's name in the credits as an electrical gaffer
He'd already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created Freddie Krueger or made the "Scream" movies
Maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic
Lincoln in the cast credits as "Aesop," a wacky character in the movie
Lincoln, from the '70s to just a few years ago, appeared in and produced adult films
He was associated with the adult spoof "The Ozporns," and just that title is funnier than all of "Tigers" attempts at humor combined
Let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel
The Western society has been fed ideas about India being a poor country
Movies like these only make those beliefs stronger
Such illustrations make it all the more difficult for Indians to be accepted abroad
Agreed there are poor and homeless in India, but why is there no representation of educated people if not the successful ones
<br /><br />I totally hated the idea of the movie portraying Patrick Swayze as another Mother Teressa
In my opinion this movie has shown India in a very bad light giving wrong notions
It is unjust to discuss only one aspect of the society
Exactly the reason why people ask me, "When we go to India, can we hire an elephant right outside the airport so we do not have to walk on the roads so full of filth and snakes?"<br /><br />Those who want a second opinion on contemporary Indian society should watch "Monsoon Wedding"
A gave it a "2" instead of a "1" (awful) because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning, a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork
<br /><br />The "sepia" toned, washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies
I can see there were some hat-tips to other old, classic movies
<br /><br />But a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting, not something that would put you to sleep
<br /><br />The story line and the script of this movie WAS awful, the characters two dimensional
Some of the scenes were pretty to look at, but ultimately, as a whole, it was quite boring, I couldn't recommend it
This "documentary" is a proof of talent being used for mean purposes
The fact that it is financed by the venezuelan government gives it a lack of legitimacy in the purpose of searching for the truth of what really happened those horrible days of April 2002 in Venezuela, something even we venezuelans don't know for sure
<br /><br />There are ways of lying, and the directors of this stuff lie both by omission and by knowledge
<br /><br />The venezuelan political process is too complex to be easily understood by foreign audiences, and they take advantage of that
For instance *POSSIBLE SPOILERS* they show pro-Chávez demonstrators shooting at an empty street (what the hell they did that for?) in a way of saying they didn't kill anyone, but didn't bother showing the images we all saw here, of opposition demonstrators (and a journalist) falling dead or injured at the other side of that "empty" street
They can't explain why the chopper of the political police was the only one authorised to fly over Caracas that day and did nothing against the snipers that were all over the roofs of the buildings nearby the presidential palace, something that would exhibit how inefficient would be the security measures to guard the President
A few days after the "coup", the chief of the military guard in charge was asked at the National Assembly (our Congress) why didn't they act against the snipers and he said "'cause they weren't there to act against the president", isn't that a confession?<br /><br />There is so much more, the fact that the highest rank military announced that Chávez had resigned and 2 days later he said he had lied because "that's politics" and nowadays is the Minister of Internal Affairs of Chávez' administration
<br /><br />It would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies depicted in this "documentary", made with the intention of selling the world an image of the good old Hugo Chávez who rules for the poor and the bad rich opposition that wants him out at all costs, when the truth is that 60-70% of people rejects his government, and that percentage includes the poor
<br /><br />I hope those of you who have seen and bought this will be able to see a different version that is being made by a group of venezuelan people showing no less than 30 lies
I should have known when I looked at the box in the video store and saw Lisa Raye - to me, she's the female Ernie Hudson A
Its almost *guaranteed* the movie will be bad (e
Congo)if Hudson is in it (with the exception of the Ghostbusters films, which were intentionally campy and bad)
Despite my instincts, and the fact that I just saw Civil Brand, yet another cinematic "tour de force" starring Lisa Raye, I rented it anyway
After all, I ignored my "Hudson instinct" on OZ and ended up watching a very quality series so I figured I'd give this movie a chance
<br /><br />If you are a lover of bad movies, this is a definite must see! This has got to be the most unintentionally funny movie I've seen in a loooong time
The plot is fairly straightforward: Racheal's (Monica Calhoun) sister is killed by a band of brigands (Led by Bobby Brown!) and, like many an action movie before this, she straps on her guns ONE LAST TIME and vows to avenge her sisters death
To do this, she reassembles the titular Gang of Roses (supposedly based on a true story of a female gang) and they go out and exact revenge and, along the way, there's some subplot or something or other about some gold that might be buried in the town
One nice thing I will say about this movie is that from what I could tell, the stars did their own riding and they looked GREAT galloping
<br /><br />The funniest (albiet unintentionally funny) scenes? Look for when they introduce Stacy Dash's character or when Calhoun's character rescinds her vow not to strap on her guns (replete with a clenched fisted cry to the heavens) or Lil' Kim's character joking with Lisa Raye's character or Stacy Dash's character being killed or Lil' Kim's character convincing Lisa Raye's character to rejoin the gang or the Asian Chick or Macy Grey's character talking bout "The debt is paid", etc
With the exception of Calhoun's Racheal and Bobby Brown's Left-Eye, I can't even remember the names of the other characters cuz I was laughing so hard when they were introduced
<br /><br />If the director had gone for parody and broad comedy this would have been a great movie
Unfortunately, he tries to take it seriously seemingly without first taking exposition, sound design (in his defense, Hip-Hop is notoriously difficult to work into a period piece), set design, script writing nor period historical research (was it me,or were these the cleanest people with the whitest teeth in the old west?) seriously
Usually when I see a movie that's not so good, I ask myself "Could you have done any better?" This is the first time in a long time where the answer is an unequivocal "YES!
When you pick a movie I hope one factor you will consider, are the actors in the movie using their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way? This is not a political statement this is a moral issue that effects are society
When a comedian/actor makes curl sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father we should ask ourselves (do I want to support that behavior)? In this case Mr
Foxx behavior tears at the social fabric that teaches our youth right from wrong, good behavior from bad that loving-kindness is better than hatefulness
Foxx should remember he is only entertainment and there is a lot of that out there for us to choose from
Saying sorry does not get him off the hook
It will not undue the hurt or remove the bad behavior he spreads to our youth
One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it
We cannot change them but we can stop the fame we give them
SPOILERS THROUGHOUT!!!!<br /><br />I had read the book "1st to die" and wanted to see if the movie followed the book so I watched it
There were some MINOR differences(location of the last violent scene for instance) but not many and for the most part the movie stayed true to the book more so then most movies
<br /><br />This may have been a mistake-although the movie was perfectly cast-with Pollen and Bellows especially-I was not that impressed with the book
I started off very impressed, gradually became more disillusioned and by the end was left completely unsatisfied and felt almost gypped
<br /><br />There is no "payoff" in the book, or the movie
Rarely have I read a who done it thriller that has created such a letdown with it's final resolution and I had hoped the movie would vary a little
<br /><br />The whole-(he did it, NO she did it, NO they BOTH did it)-was not interesting, not fascinating and more confusing, annoying and depressing then anything else
Add to that, that the love of Lindsay's life dies at the end(after HER disease cleares and she cries at his grave)
and then cut to where she's contemplating suicide
then all of a sudden she's in a fight for her life with the REAL villain who was cleared after being arrested
but it turns out he and the wife were in it together
HELLO!!! This whole thing has now become "GENERAL HOSPITAL" instead of a good old fashioned thriller
I felt cheated and ripped off by the book and watching the movie(I must admit it held my attention nicely -the acting was very good for a TV movie)was hoping it wouldn't follow the book which it wound up doing
<br /><br />I still think the movie is watchable and for some reason does not leave as bad a taste in your mouth as the book(or maybe it's just that I knew what would happen)But I have to say the way this story unraveled was not well done at all
There is simply no use in trying to glorify any part of this film
At the very beginning you might think that you are in for a visually stunning piece of cinematography
and then shortly thereafter you are hit with a large sack (burlap) of FAIL! The fighting is barely martial, the acting is teetering on the edge of par, and the music is not worth describing
There is only enough of a story to have created an excuse for this film to have been made
The decisions that the characters make and the way that they deal with the situations is weak, and did nothing but frustrate me
I think that the only reason this film came about was to act as a bit of fan service by using Yumiko Shaku
The closing song by Johnny Rivers was the only great thing about this movie
Unfortunately that is all the positive I can say about this western movie
I have to write 8 more lines for my comments to be posted, but there is more than 8 lines of awful in this western
I am not sure if the movie was a tribute to Hopa Along, or just a spoof
The hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic
A lot of the supporting actors in this movie looked authentic, but the shooting scenes were a joke
A previous commentator thought this movie was great, and in the comments took a cheap shot at President Bush
This was not a democratic or republican western
It was just a bad western movie to be sold commercially
At times I thought I was watching a movie made by college movie students
If that was the case, then it was a great movie
When teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichés that you can guarantee will follow
<br /><br />1)The teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local
Dan Van Husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly Sirens
What, who, how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst
3)Whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about
4)They will find a house inhabited by a madman, he will capture them
5) The house will have a phone but it will not work, it will be disturbingly decorated, there will be flickering neon light, spiders and maggots
6)The madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won't start (here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor)
7)The madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap, weak scare and will then be killed properly
8)Only a girl will be left alive from the group
9)There will be an unnecessary twist at the end
<br /><br />Add to these elements naked Sirens (who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately) that seduce and kill the teens, throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie
<br /><br />I think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but I am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film, Darkhunters, which is one of the worst films I have ever seen
At times the cinematography is very good, the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies
I was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity
However, the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film, it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again, but amongst the DVD extras
<br /><br />If you do rent this film I implore you to listen to the director's commentary it is beyond belief
There is more to say about this than the film itself
One staggering part of the commentary is the director's claim that the film is cliché leaden because it was a preconceived idea
He says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichés and openly he wonders if "people will get it"
<br /><br />I'm afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichés within them then it is not wittily scripted enough, acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work
If this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question; "What was the point?" This is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies, any attempt to do something clever or different haven't worked
<br /><br />The next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats
They rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use
However, the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when Michael Mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary
There is a simple distinction to be made here; Mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style, Roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures
I think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant
<br /><br />The best moment is reserved for Robert's comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film
Those who didn't like it are generalised as 'geeks' and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that
I must admit I was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn't singled out for ridicule
The tirade goes further as the group joke about Norwegian reviewers, complete with 'hilarious' accents to imply that people from Norway wouldn't know a good film simply because of where they are born
As always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting, they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant
<br /><br />The package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the Sirens were cast
Robert's swears blind in voice over, 'I didn't want to make a film that was like Baywatch' as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground
There is also a simpering, self-indulgent documentary about the making of Darkhunters during which Robert's says that a reviewer has claimed that Forest is "The best British film in years"
I don't know who he is trying to convince
At one point in the commentary track Robert's says jokingly "I can see people sitting at home saying "this isn't amazing, its sh$t" he isn't wrong
(possible spoilers)<br /><br />Someone once asked Dr
Seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas
He turned them down, insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous Chuck Jones TV special from 1966 (also in mind, perhaps, was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953's The 5,000 Fingers of Dr
died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights
But with the commonplace use of CGI effects becoming a reality, Mrs
Universal made her a generous offer she accepted; she also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the title character
Supposedly she was satisfied with the final result
<br /><br />The film was given a $123,000,000 budget (which is more than even Heaven's Gate cost, including the adjustment for inflation), which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup, set design, and special effects (which are undermined<br /><br />somewhat by the rather hazy cinematography)
Unfortunately, it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S
Seaman (scribes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, which made much better<br /><br />use of a high budget) turned in
Whereas the TV special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials, this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the Grinch
It turns out that, as a child, he was the subject of ridicule, including an especially humiliating experience one Christmas at the age of eight
So it turns out that everything that ails our poor Mr
Trouble is, it seems like a rather long 105 minutes, with too much dead wood clogging up the story
That might not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a little more
Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of heart
Carrey's Grinch is a loud, hyperactive oaf and, at times, a thug who, when made the holiday `Cheermeister,' trashes the Whoville town square in anger<br /><br />(hopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked)
This undermines the script's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic, with all the Whos down in Whoville so unsympathetic (at least in this interpretation)
Seuss's vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas
The Whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled, selfish, materialistic ninnies; an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism
This is offensively<br /><br />hypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from American consumerism, and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandising<br /><br />campaign
<br /><br />The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but crucial character in the original
The innocent two-year-old waif who walked in on this spurious Santa is now older and wiser, constantly questioning the false values of the Whos and trying to understand the Grinch's point of view (her one major scene from the original is re-enacted, making it seem out of character)
She<br /><br />seems to be the only one who would ever know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, thus making her a completely different, and more annoying, character
<br /><br />Those who celebrate Christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in their<br /><br />stockings on the morning of December 25 than a copy of this overlong, overacted, excruciatingly tedious, ham-handed, crude attempt to turn the children's classic into a feature film
It proves once and for all that darkness, vulgarity,<br /><br />manipulation, and heavy-handedness are inadequate substitutes for charm, wit, sincerity, and heart
The folks at Universal should get down on their collective knees and thank God that this truly bilious $123 million stink bomb grossed $260 million domestically or they'd not be here today
Furthermore it made Mike Myers' The Cat in the Hat possible
30 seconds into the opening credits, I had this feeling that this was going to be a bad movie, but I didn't know just how bad
Then the actor playing the evil Nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and I decide that in order to survive this movie, we'll have to turn the volume down, make up our own dialogue and double the speed on the DVD
Now, I've lived through some very bad movies before, both with and without the aide of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie," but there are just some movies which I doubt even the Bots can save
The biggest part of the movie that bothered me the most was that the people hypnotized into believing they're zombies had rotting green skin
I guess they were all hypnotized into death, then hypnotized into rotting themselves
Stick to the real B-movie cult classics like "Plan Nine From Outer Space
I was expecting the movie based on Grendel, the book written by John Gardner in the late 1970's
It was based on the Beowulf epic, but told from the perspective of the monster
<br /><br />Whatever you may think of Gardner's book, a movie based on the Beowulf epic should not be entitled Grendel, when it doesn't say anything more about the monster beyond the few pathetic scenes in which the CG monster is shown as nothing more than a modified Predator
<br /><br />On top of this, the writers should also be punished for screwing up the original story so badly and contributing to the continued growing ignorance of mass TV audiences throughout the US
<br /><br />Typical Hollywood to get this so wrong
<br /><br />Very disappointing and a complete waste of time
Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen--yes she's related to Bruce), the killer from the first film, is up to her old tricks again
She's one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills
As long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing things are fine
But a few step over the line and Angela kills them--cracking bad jokes all the way
<br /><br />The original "Sleepaway Camp" was a vicious and nasty splatter film but had some good points to it
This is vicious and nasty too but has NO good points to it
The plot has been done to death and this adds NOTHING new to the formula
There are plenty of gory killings in here (people are burnt alive, heads are cut off, throats slashed) but all the gore is so obviously fake it actually become comical
This also has the smallest amount of campers I've ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles (especially Higgins)
As expected there's the gratuitous female nudity (here provided by the tremendously untalented Valerie Hartman) and the obligatory good girl/good boy team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins)
With the sole exception of Springsteen and Higgins the acting is lousy--even by slasher movie standards
There's also a cruel edge to this movie in which one character is drowned in an outhouse! Boring and sick with a stupid plot, pointless nudity and bad gore
I have to admit I laughed a few times during this trivial 2004 holiday movie, but it's already moving out of my short-term memory
In a career that is sliding rather swiftly toward tabloid obscurity, Ben Affleck, once a promising comic character actor who became enmeshed in the Hollywood publicity machine to recreate himself into a romantic leading man
Judging from this film, the transformation doesn't seem to be taking, as he continues to lack the gravitas that would make him credible in such parts
While his buddy Matt Damon takes on smart roles in films like "Syriana", Affleck appears in this type of commercial pap
At least the superficial character of successful but lonely advertising executive Drew Latham suits Affleck better than most of the other roles he has tried
<br /><br />Directed by Mike Mitchell (whose most famous film is 1999's "Deuce Bigelow: Male Gigolo") and scripted by no less than four screenwriters (always a bad sign), the flimsy plot revolves around his character's need to "rent" a family living in his childhood home in order to live out his fantasy of having the old-fashioned Christmas he never had
The concept is actually intriguing because there is something to be said about the cathartic release of sentimentality we are all directed to feel amid the frenzied commercialism around the holidays
The real problem, however, is that the movie feels like an extended sketch lacking any logic or authentic emotional resonance
Affleck seems to be on overdrive attempting desperately to be lovable, but the net result is an exhausting turn by an actor who has an increasingly annoying habit of playing stupid people in ill-conceived films
Fortunately, he has the likes of James Gandofini and Catherine O'Hara playing the Valcos, the couple who decide to accept Drew's monetary offer to pretend to be his parents
<br /><br />Gandolfini plays Tom like a gruff, non-violent relative of Tony Soprano, but he does what he can in the role
From her classic SCTV Days to Christopher Guest's mockumentaries, O'Hara is always a comic gem no matter the vehicle, and unsurprisingly she earns the best laughs as Tom's wife Christine, whether dryly delivering a one-liner or posing in an inch of make-up for a dominatrix photo shoot
In what is becoming her standard screen role, Christina Applegate plays their mistrusting daughter Alicia, who of course becomes Drew's love interest
Despite some good moments where she is enjoying the deceit of playing Drew's sister in front of his girlfriend's family, her character seems to change in lightning-flash strokes making it hard to see what Drew would see in her
The story spins completely out of control by the last third with one contrived situation piled on top of another until plot strands are tied together in short order
It's rumored that much of the movie was improvised since there was no finished shooting script
It shows, but I also have to admit I stuck with it to the bitter end
I'm among millions who consider themselves Cary Grant fans, but I can't think of a single reason to recommend this movie
I don't understand the casting of Betsy Drake and it appears no one else did,if we're to judge from the small number of films in which she played afterwards
<br /><br />Most fans will agree that Katharine Hepburn was superb at chasing and catching Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby
Here the director or writers try to rehash the idea,but it fails miserably
I've read comments about how "creepy" Drake was,but I thought that was far too mild a description
Franchot Tone walked through this one as if he were hungover
<br /><br />This one doesn't deserve 10 lines of comments and I don't know why that's a requirement
Too bad this one was preserved when so many worthwhile films lie rotting in vaults
<br /><br />Unless you want to torture someone,give this one a wide berth
From the acting, direction, scriptwriting and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims
When did we get so sad that they have to fill a a children's movie with sexual innuendo to keep the parents attention
<br /><br />Dr Suess is rolling in his grave right now, what with the "dirty ho" "S
Its shameful how they trade on the name of Suess to get the parents to bring their kids, throw in the profanities to try for the teens and a few sad parents who won't watch a a film with their child if there is no T & A
<br /><br />Compare this to the classic children's films and we can get a disturbing view of world is turning into
These guys should stick to making MTV videos
How on earth this movie got >400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me
About time they released this movie on DVD
I know some say WB rush the release of this movie because of The Dreamgirls movie
But, how can you rush the release of a movie that's been in you catalog since 1976
<br /><br />I'm very disappointed with the DVD release of this movie, no special feature, no 5
come on WB, you can do much better then this
The audio and picture quality on this movie needs some serious help
<br /><br />Seem WB didn't place as much time and attention to this movie because it is a black movie and my have okay sales
They could have kept the CD which by the way dose not have all the songs the original CD has
<br /><br />Would I recommend this DVD for purchase
But WB need to go add some more special feature
Take notes from other group movies, The Five Heatbeats, or The Temptation were you may view just the performance, and the sound on both are much, much, much better than this DVD
Posh Spice Victoria Beckham and her alleged new adventures after just moving to LA for work purposes (footballer hubby David is now a Galaxy LA player after his transfer from Real Madrid) was originally going to be a full series,but was thankfully abridged to just one hour or so
But even in this form,it is still numbingly interminable
<br /><br />Like virtually all 'reality' TV shows,most of the incident comes across as blatantly faked,with the programme itself even admitting that Posh's newly appointed personal assistant is an actress
An Ugly-Betty lookalike,we hear some lamely written and performed banter early on(with an obvious joke about Becks' apparent dalliance with a previous,and rather more glamorous PA Rebecca Loos,though her name is not mentioned) with further sequences involving a fake blow-up doll to trick the paparazzi and hopeless attempts to pitch a baseball
<br /><br />This could have been more entertaining if all had acknowledged it was a piece of fluff,and had an actress or impersonator in the lead role
Talented impressionist Ronni Ancona would've been perfect and is better at being Posh than Posh herself is,and if this more sensible decision had been taken,much more fun and amusement would've ensued
Sadly,we are left with the real thing here (Ms Ancona may have rejected the script as too weak anyway),and although there are odd scattered attempts at self-deprecation and irony,it never remotely works because of prior info of La Beckham's considerable wealth beforehand,and her non-ability at delivering would-be jokes;despite the intentions to send up her image,Mrs Beckham comes across as a shallow egotist,and her weak one-liners don't persuade us she has any humorous self-awareness
I suspect that if a more realistic fly-on-the-wall documentary approach had been taken,namely Posh walking down any street in LA and being totally ignored (instead of the frantic,staged scenes of mild hysteria on show here), and associates making unscripted jibes about the previously mentioned Ms Loos,this would've made marginally better TV,but being sycophantic PR material,the bony one herself would never allow such events to happen
<br /><br />Having said that,the later scenes where she made a special appearance at the baseball stadium where she was indifferently presented in front of an uninterested crowd show it will be tough times ahead if she wants to make it big in Hollywood
Her colleague Scary Spice (aka Mel Brown) also found it impossible to make it big residing in the movie capital despite her affair (which was not consummated) with big name Eddie Murphy
<br /><br />The Spice Girls were of course a massively successful bubblegum pop group in the mid 1990's,more so in their native Britain but still popular briefly in other countries,including the US
They were certainly good fun at their peak of glory (1997) when there seemed to be a glorious period of optimism in the UK with Cool Britannia and a New Labour government which The Spice Girls seemed to sum up better then anyone else at the time,even if it was somewhat manufactured
But they were never outstanding musical or singing talents,and UK optimism seemed to fade rapidly later that year (the starting point was arguably the tragic death of Princess Diana),as did The Spices' themselves
Their presence on the music and entertainment scene soon became repetitive and obvious,and if they had all quietly moved out of the public eye permanently with dignity to enjoy their fortunes, then we would have all had pleasant memories encrypted on our mind without any guilt
Unfortunately,the emergence of the hideous 'celebrity' culture in the UK towards the start of the millennium has put paid to those imaginings,and we have all suffered thousands,if not millions of stories about the Spices since,Posh being the worst offender,with the rest of her colleagues not too far behind
It was recently announced that there will be a reunion tour soon,which is baffling as they have never gone away and they certainly don't require any additions to their swelling bank accounts
Maybe it's because two of them are struggling single mothers,perhaps?<br /><br />Good,it's soon time for Becks' adventures on a revelatory documentary next,I can hardly wait
I have rarely been subjected to such outright nonsense in a film that is supposed to be based on a historical figure
A horrible joke of a film, I cringed throughout
Terrible, trite, distorted and riddled with outright lies and half truths
<br /><br />The famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw was to originally be a consultant for this film
However, he found the script to be so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused, and also demanded they stop using his name as a source (it embarrassed him to think people would think he was involved)
<br /><br />One scene shows Hitler beating his dog
He brought in the strictest animal welfare laws in Europe, banned vivisection and animal experimentation
<br /><br />The film turns his gaining of the Iron Cross into a farce, involving bribery
He was awarded it for repeated acts of bravery over a long period of time
<br /><br />There are no historical documents showing that Hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his niece
<br /><br />Apart from these, Hitler is portrayed as a rabid simpleton in this garbage flick
<br /><br />If he was even half as ignorant, demented and thick as he is in this nonsense film as in real life you would not even know he had ever existed
<br /><br />Honestly, this film was utterly terrible
<br /><br />Go watch Downfall and give this a very wide berth
This movie is nothing like "Office Space" except in the premise
I would not recommend this movie to anyone, as I laughed not once during the entire film
Cornbluth's self-indulgent tirades quickly become more annoying than 15 Jason Alexanders in the same room
If you decide to see this movie, use a free rental or watch it at someone else's house so you can leave if necessary
I was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in North Carolina
Instead I watched a man who rues the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the Duke family
McElwee's family had prevailed over the Dukes I doubt that Mr
McElwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobacco-related diseases
McElwee's family began it tobacco business ; I expected more than McEwee's continual focus on his family
I learned very little about the history of tobacco in the NC economy and the ramifications to the state's economy by tighter regulation of tobacco
The countless references to the movie "Bright Leaves" are out of place - So what if Gary Cooper played Mr
McElwee's great grandfather? Does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by the showing of old film clips of a fictionalized film? I didn't
You can give JMS and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget, but the movie is still sub-par
Dont get me wrong, B5 the series is by far the best TV series ever, but if i was an exec seeing this movie, i wouldnt have ordered the series
I dont like O'Hare as an actor, the costumes are silly, and there are tons of cliches
The same can be said for most of the first season (with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors); Bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle
If you are a B5 fan and havent seen this movie, see it
so altogether i found this documentary to be strange and really pointless
i know it got awards and things, but i personally did not enjoy it too much
there was no humor or drama in it to keep you interested, just a bunch of wierdos and their jobs
some of the people in are rather different which isn't a bad thing, it just didn't leave a good impression on me
i was thoroughly bored by this movie, no offense to my creative writing teacher
the circus theme throughout the whole movie was kinda cool but i didn't get it, and robotics and lion taming is definitely not my thing
the green animals thing was neat, i really liked the garden lots of colorful flowers, but how did these four jobs connect? it just didn't make much sense to me why someone would make a movie about that
But if you are into stuff like this you might enjoy it
I am just forewarning you about possible suffering
This film was the recipient of the 1990 Academy award for Best Animated Short Film
Over the last few weeks, I have seen dozens of the nominees and recipients of this award from the last 30 years and I really think that this film might just be the worst of them all--yet it wasn't just a nominee but it won!! I assume that 1989 must have just been a horrible year for the genre
<br /><br />The film shows a group of characters that look a bit like super-skinny Uncle Festers
The appear to be simple articulated figures who are moved using stop motion animation
All are identical--with the same faces, bodies and clothes
The only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their backs
They are all standing on a large platform that is suspended, as if by magic, in space
Each has a pole and their is also a box on the platform
The platform begins tilting slightly and in response the men move about in an effort to balance the platform
This goes on and on and on and on for the longest time
The only relief from this tedium is when one of them acts rather nasty towards the end, but it just isn't enough to make this fun to watch in the least
Aside from passable stop motion animation, this short offers nothing of interest to me
<br /><br />By the way, the great short KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989 and I have no idea why it was not among the nominees
It was a GREAT short and was far better than any of the nominees that year or the year before
Perhaps Pixar's success in previous years resulted in a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and so funny it seems almost criminal to have ignored it
Could Pixar have not entered it? This seems unlikely
In Hollywood in the 1930's and 1940's, I think that every studio can make a western, except Warner bros
The few times they try, it always ridiculous (except, perhaps, for They Died with their Boots on - which is a cavalery western
) I have read that Humphrey Bogart, seing James Cagney with this big cowboy hat on his head, said that he looks like a mushroom
True! Cagney and Bogart are too urban, too XXe century to be credible in a western movie
The story here had no suprise, and it did't help
Every 10 minutes, I figure I can see Bogart and Cagney drops their little guns and put hands in a machine gun to get away from the set in a 1930's black car
LOC could have been a very well made movie on how the Kargil war was fought; it had the locations, the budget, and the skill to have been India's "Saving Private Ryan" or "Black Hawk Down"
Instead it come across as a bloated, 4 hour bore of trying to meld the war move with the masala movie
Even the war scenes were terribly executed, using the same hill in all their battle scenes, and spending unnecessary time on casual talk
Instead of trying to appeal to the indian public, a better movie would have been a to-the-book account of what happened at Kargil (like "Black Hawk Down") or even spending time on the militant point of view (like "Tora, Tora, Tora")
Even better, it could have used a competent director like Ram Gopal Verma to write, direct and edit the film
Until then, I'd like to see some one re-edit this film, with only the pertinent portions included; it would make the movie more watchable
This is the kind of movie which shows the paucity of French cinema when it comes to making thrillers
The director's desire to "sound American" is so glaring that you will not be fooled a minute,unless you have not seen a serial killer movie since "Peeping Tom"
<br /><br />Two male cops (or one and a half,more like,as you will see),horrible murders,a plot more complicated than complex
Charles Berling is not lucky with the genre(see the astoundlingly dumb "l'inconnu de Strasbourg" a couple of years ago)
The scenes with his pregnant wife -which are supposed to be a counterpart for the otherwise noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot-are among the worst ever filmed
Add a steamy love scene between them and a gory autopsy to get a PG 12 and thus to attract the huge adolescent audience
A violent and absurd conclusion,followed by a silent epilogue who could make a nice commercial for the côte d'azur,it's really the silence of the lame
I read the book Celestine Prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie
Be advised that the movie is loosely based on the book
Many of the book's most interesting points do not even come out in the movie
Many events, characters, how the character interact and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur
The flow of events that in the book are very smooth, are choppy and fed to the view as though you a child
Personnallities of the characters differ from those in the book
The direction is similar to a "B" horror flick
I understand that it would take six hours in film to present all that is in the book, but they screen play base missed many points
American Pie has gone a long distance from the first
At first i believe the actors don't have a clue what their doing and instead it's just a remake of a college party gone nuts
Story sets out as two freshman college guys (featuring the young stifler) setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties, sex and of course the booze
The plot is stupid and comes along way away from the original pie
In fact they didn't once again feature an apple pie somewhere in the film
<br /><br />Luckily i work in a video store and can rent for free
But please remember it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex films with absolute nudity and insane drinking
I'm a teen myself and i believe even Evan almighty would've been a better choice instead
I was very skeptical about sacrificing my precious time to watch this film
I didn't enjoy the first one at all, and the last Jean Claude Van Damme film I liked was Blood Sports! After managing to sit through it all? Avoid, avoid, avoid!
College students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are stalked by an elusive killer
<br /><br />The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans
The movies production values are pretty low and the story for the most part is pretty routine, there's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring
In fact much of the story's build-up is pretty forgettable, save for one or two brutal murders
But the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and one fairly bold, unconventional conclusion
<br /><br />The cast is lackluster for the most part
Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character
Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an ill-fated student
<br /><br />Over all this is a pretty standard B slasher effort, but the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete ho-hum
After the success of Part 4, another sequel was a natural move
However they should have stopped it before it began
Alice, having survived Part 4 finds herself pregnant and it seems Freddy is using her unborn child to get at his victims, which of course are Alice's friends
Strange Nightmare movie, very heavy on religious imagery and bad acting
The special effects are good, but the movie itself is not
I rented this one to see Vanesa Talor one more time
She can act, but doesn't get a chance in this clunker
The opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes
Must have come from a stock archive, because the movie is shot direct to videotape
The production values make _Blair Witch_ look professional
There's a really cheesy animated statue, but no other effects worth noting
The players would do well not to mention it on their resumes
Ah WINTER KILLS , based on the novel by Richard Condon which deals with a conspiracy that killed the president of the United States 20 years ago
I knew Condon also wrote THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE which dealt with a similar theme and was looking forward to seeing an intelligent thriller<br /><br />WINTER KILLS left me cold
It's not a thriller - It's a piece of worthless crap , possibly the worst movie I've seen this month and boy have I seen a lot of bad movies in June
The problem lies in both the direction and the script and seeing as William Richert was responsible for both then he should be blamed entirely for this unfunny farce <br /><br />There's two things wrong with this movie
First off is the way everything is presented in a totally over the top manner
It's not as OTT as say something like that James Bond movie with David Niven and Peter Sellers but everything has a farcial edge to it with actors completely mugging their performances
This might have been justified if there was entertainment value to the movie but there's none
As a satire it's very silly , so silly that it becomes almost unwatchable
Secondly the scenes seem to have been cut so much that they're rendered senseless
Take for example a scene where the hero is confronting a loopy militia leader called Dawson
Dawson tells the hero he has 30 seconds start then it cuts to the hero being on board a plane
The scenes begin and end with no rhyme nor reason<br /><br />A dire movie that's an ordeal to sit throug
And I must say, it was actually better then the first one
At the begin, I realized, It is actually a sequel, not a remake but not a good one
I do not like the old movies and series of Galactica, because the cylons saw like toasters (just as it was mentioned in this new movie) and were completely harmless for the old galactica
This movie turns the sides - the Humans were harmless but the whole movie was for me completely chaotic and stupid
Many scenes were unnecessary, for instance the story of the "computer expert" - completely a crap
If I were a scriptwriter I would leave him die in his house, killed by the cylon woman
And the evacuation from the planet? Oh, please if it would be bombed by 50 Megatons (why exactly 50 MT??) nukes, they would be dead killed by the radiation
And how is it actually possible that the big fleet of cylon was completely hidden before the attack? Aha, it was possibly this computer virus, created by the cylon - the script was probably written by ten-years-old school boy
The good side of the movie is, that the humans are at last defeated!! Really defeated, the population is near the extinction (children are dieing - two times explicit in the movie: 1
a baby!!! maybe one month old and a girl in age of max ten - what a violence
And the bad-asses won and I think it is the first time in such sci-fi galaxy fight movie
I also appreciate the design of the cylons (not only of the humanoid cylon:-) a good job with these ships - I like the design of the ships by both of them - human an cylons
The human ships are a good never version of the old ones
And galactica - really pretty with these docks, I liked that
But this is all, only the design is not enough
The acting was really bad, the whole plot was expectable (only two things not - the human-cylon on the ragnardocks and the human-cylon at the end)
The dialogs were trivial (and in the Slovak dabbing just stupid, but that is not fault of the movie)
The whole movie looked like a pilot film for a series, but who would shoot such series? What it would be about? One star for the design the second one for the near extinction of humanity
It's a very poorly done film with a lot of violence
I suppose it follows cheaply along the lines of every slasher movie you've ever seen
It has the usual isolated place, the cocky campers, heading off to the wilderness
Granted, there are some pretty intense scenes
There are ghost children who sound like they are talking into a wastebasket
I'm not really sure what rules the ghosts and the psycho with the seed cap are playing by
It also has the gross out scene where a man eats a piece of meat which is actually what's left of his wife
A friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of gratuitous, sick violence
I fear that it's just another step in our desensitized evolution
Three is no cleverness here, no tongue in cheek, only a sad waste of time
Here we have 2 misunderstood kids who never stood a chance against a cruel, poverty riddled existence: Robin Hoods singled out by the police for persecution because they were a trifle wild at times
Gad! According to this crap Bonnie was the sweetest little thing west of the Missouri who was taught to be a psychopathic murderer by a fun loving boyfriend who didn't really want to hurt anybody
he just wanted things without putting a lot of energy into getting them
Badly acted, poorly filmed, unbelievable dialogue, unrealistic use of weaponry, gore that looked more like grape jelly than the real thing
First things first: I'm not a conservative
And even though I would never refer to myself as a liberal or a Democrat, I was opposed to the war in Iraq from day one
I think it's safe to say John Cusack and I would probably see eye-to-eye on politics, in fact, I'm sure we'd become drinking buddies if we ever got to talking about how great Adam Curtis' BBC docs are
My point is this: don't discredit this review by thinking I'm not a part of the choir Cusack is preaching to in War, Inc
There's no question WI's politics are tailored to appeal to my demographic, but the problem is, the tailoring is substandard and the the film Cusack co- wrote, produced and stars in, fits worse than a cheap suit
<br /><br />As they say "the road to hell is paved with good intentions
" Cusack, his co-writers, director Joshua Seftel and even the actors involved, no doubt had every intention of making an anti- war film every bit as biting and funny as Robert Altman's M*A*S*H, unfortunately for the viewer, they ended up with one as unfunny and unintelligent as Michael Moore's Canadian Bacon
<br /><br />The current state of US politics, foreign policy and the war "effort" is already absurd and, as a result, tragic, pathetic and, regrettably comical -- just watch The Daily Show and see for yourself
The bottom line is: you can't write material as funny as what the Bush administration provides us on a daily basis, so why try to compete?<br /><br />The main problem with WI is that it feels it was put together in a hurry
To get it done, Cusack basically cannibalized Grosse Pointe Blank (one of his best films), changed the setting and crammed in a shopping list of ideas lifted from the collected works of Naomi Klein
Most of these ideas are rammed down your throat in the first twenty minutes of the film and what makes them so obnoxious is none of the jokes or gags or deliberately obvious references to Halliburton, the Neo-Cons and the US occupation of Iraq, are imaginative, clever or funny
The writers are so blinded by their own dogma they felt that by simply referencing these issues the film would be funny and subversive
By now these ideas are yesterday's news and unless you've been living under or rock or are so blinded by ignorance, denial and sheer stupidity (read: a right-wing Christian), these jokes insultingly simple
<br /><br />Perhaps WI would work if it was more nuanced, subversive, offensive and fattened up with detailed research/insights into the Occupation
As it is, the jokes and sight gags are all surface and are so bad, with so little finesse, subtlety or satirical wickedness, they did little more than make me groan
Homer Simpson once said "It's funny 'cause it's true" and The Daily Show proves this every night; War, Inc
however proves that just because it's true doesn't make it funny
The bottom line: hyperbole isn't required when it comes to lampooning US/Neo-Conservative politics
<br /><br />How do you know when you're in the middle of a pretentious art film? Is it that there is only 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of film? Is it when Bjork is wearing what looks like a giant furry pita on her head in a pseudo-Asian ritual? Maybe when mammoth turds and spinal columns are used in a whale blubber experiment
Or, when you're about ready to kill the composer for making a minimal, and still annoying, version of a Philip Glass score? In any case, Drawing Restraint 9 is among the most pretentious of the modern art movies
At 135 minutes, it adds to its pretension by being boring to boot
I would call the use of color stunning, and the opening sequence interesting, but the rest of the movie looked like it was filmed for a Discovery Channel documentary
That is until it looks like they were trying to film their version of P-ss Christ, but that will be coming up later
<br /><br />Actually, the documentary-esquire portions were the best parts of it
The surface plot is about a whaling ship, and then there is a ritual about making whale fat
Then, there are the guests in the form of Bjork and Matthew Barney who are welcomed on the ship by being put through a ritual of humiliation which includes passed-out head shaving (think frat boy pranks), nicotine patches, and giant furry pita hats
Then there is mutual evisceration, cannibalism, and lets not forget the giant turd
<br /><br />Matthew Barney has written that this is about "the relationship between self-imposed resistance and creativity
" That's almost like saying, "if you don't get it, then you're not creative in your interpretation, so sod off because I'm an artist
" Oh, wait, that's the POST-modern interpretation of that sentence and what the movie would be about if it was POST-modern
<br /><br />So, let's start this whole interpretation bit, shall we? The following lines are only 3/4 serious and should not be taken as any realistic attempt to interpret the movie
<br /><br />The first half-hour concerns pearl divers and the construction of a giant ramp
Obviously, the ramp is symbolic of the need for self-elevation to whatever standards you hold dear, and the pearl divers are looking for pearls of wisdom
Then, on a whaling ship, they build a crate that looks like it is in the crude shape of a whale
Obviously a crude element of foreshadowing
<br /><br />On the ship, they make whale fat inside the shape of the whale, and take out the fins portion
They replace this with a spinal column and later a giant turd
These are supposed to be the states of the movie itself
When its fat, its entertaining but bad for you
When it is the spinal column, its the "important" parts of the movie, or the backbone so to speak
Then, the giant turd is the bowels of the movie, or when the movie is crap
<br /><br />Bjork and Matthew Barney the arrive on separate ships, are put into strange humiliating outfits which AREN'T EVEN WELL MADE OR SYMMETRICAL, one suspects that they ran out of money and Barney was trying to quit smoking
They go through a ritual and learn about the ship from a Japanese wise man, who tells them that the ship is scarred from when another ship hit it; a crash or intersection, if you will
This inspires Bjork and Barney, who are different on the outside, to start cutting each other's legs off and eat them so they could turn into whales themselves and be the same person
Oh, did I forget to mention that this has been done in a Robbie Williams video? Then, the pearl divers come back with their mouths full of pearls of knowledge which they let fall to make a stupid Venn Diagram
Barney made it through 8th grade geometry, obviously
<br /><br />Oh, and did I forget Bjork's ear-gouging I-want-to-kill-her score? At times it is hypnotic, but at others you just want to assassinate her
<br /><br />Art film is one thing, but when you just throw up all sorts of symbolism in the hopes of getting a reaction out of people, it becomes a self-destructive joke
When do you cross the line between becoming a joke in terms of art? Dali and Bunuel frequently made surreal pieces of nonsense but were more coherent and/or entertaining than this piece of trash
Un Chien Andalou had the sensibility to cram as much symbolism as it could into less than half an hour
<br /><br />So, can I recommend this? Only if you like dull HIGH ART films with lots of symbolism and flat imagery
I think he's one of the funniest stand-ups around today
Possibly that means I'm going into this with too high expectations, but I just didn't find Eddie funny in this outing
<br /><br />I think the main problem is Eddie is trying too hard to be Eddie
Everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic, and we all love him for it
But in Circle, he appears to be going more for irrelevant than funny, and completely lost me in places
Many of the topics he covers he has covered before - I even think I recognised a few recycled jokes in there
<br /><br />If you buy the DVD you'll find a behind-the-scenes look at Eddie's tour (interesting in places, but not very funny), and a French language version of one of his shows
Die-hards will enjoy seeing Eddie in a different language, but subtitled comedy isn't very funny
<br /><br />If you're a fan of Eddie you've either got this already or you're going to buy it whatever I say
If you're just passing through, buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill - you won't be disappointed
I often feel like Scrooge, slamming movies that others are raving about - or, I write the review to balance unwarranted raves
I found this movie almost unwatchable, and, unusual for me, was fast-forwarding not only through dull, clichéd dialog but even dull, clichéd musical numbers
Whatever originality exists in this film -- unusual domestic setting for a musical, lots of fantasy, some animation -- is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought-provoking plot development
Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey appear to be nice people, but can't carry a movie as a team
Neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal
I like Billy Gray, but his character is pretty one-note
The best part of the film, to me, are June Haver's beautiful costumes and great body
Irene Dunne finished her illustrious career with this so-so movie
She should have gone out with a bang, being the classy actress she was, not in this unmemorable, almost unknown film
<br /><br />This lightweight comedy is okay, but nothing special
The first half of it is far better as it gets pretty stupid in the second half
Maybe Irene could see the handwriting on the wall and quit
Even her high-pitched voice got a bit annoying in here
Rumor has it she was not happy with this film
<br /><br />The story reminded me of a 1950s television sitcom
Speaking of that, I thought David Nelson from the Ozzie & Harriet TV show was in this movie but it turned out to be a very young Richard Crenna
<br /><br />Overall, so-so at best and a sub-par ending for a great actress
This movie must have been the absolute worst movie i have ever seen
My sister and her boyfriend went to rent Zodiac (2007) and got this one by accident
thought it was a joke before the actual movie
this was terrible i was waiting for it to get scary and it never did
this movie had not actual facts about the real Zodiac killer
The filmmakers clearly didn't even bother to research anything on the killings
so they decided to write a script about nothing true to its name
I am upset i didn't realize it wasn't the movie sooner
I try to like something out of every movie, i don't hate movies
If you could have given it no stars, i definitely would have
This movie is by far the worst movie ever made
If you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays Lars in heavyweights than don't make the damn film
I have to say that I could watch Leprechaun in Space 6 times before I could watch the trailer for this POS of a movie
Adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace
Watching this movie is like a mix of listening to Cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender
Anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime
If I had an extra dollar and had to spend it, I'd give it to the support Lorraina Bobbitt foundation before buying this movie
Everyone involved with this project should be ashamed as to the result of their efforts
I laughed a coupe of times , but I laughed a couple of times during Schindler's list also
Jeff Lowell has written & directed 'Over Her Dead Body' poorly
The idea is first of all, is as stale as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cake
<br /><br />Minus Eva Longoria Parker there is hardly anything appealing in this film
Eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performance
<br /><br />Paul Rudd looks jaded and least interested
She looks manly and delivers a strictly average performance
Jason Biggs is wasted, so is Lindsay Sloane
<br /><br />I expected entertainment more from this film
Michael Williams, who works for BBC, finds a somehow impressive Italian picture which gets mixed in the material of his ongoing task titled DIABOLICAL ART: A DOCUMENTARY
But since his wife's mysterious death her daughter, Emily, has been emotionally disturbed, so he goes Spoleto, where the problematic picture is, with her and her nanny, Jill
And there is a Countess, who is also a psychic, and she informs him that the picture was somehow made at the night that a young witch named Emilia was executed
Michael doesn't believe her story, but after that Emily has hysterical spasm and Jill is killed
This Italian film is, of course, almost innocently influenced by THE EXORCIST, but this one is much cheaper, much simpler,and in a sense, much dirtier
First of all, it should be said this film is full of confusion
For instance, the story shows Emily is a reincarnation of Emilia
But when Emily sees her in the flashbacks, she perceives her exclusively from a third-person's point of view
But if she is the reincarnation of Emilia, she should and must see the past from nothing but Emilia's point of view
Confusions of this kind, which the film has many, are almost exclusively based upon a problematic fact that the film is too cowardly, rather than ambivalent, to specify its own quasi-Freudian theme, namely, pre-adolescent girl's one-way incestuous wish
To make matters worse, this film also has characteristic problem (if not confusion); every character is too naive and helpless to be realistic and/or believable living human
Regarding Emily (or Emilia), she is after all a child, and one can say it is difficult to blame her mainly for her naiveness and helplessness
(And according to the Freudian theory, every girl wants to have her father's child(ren) in her own way
In this sense, Emily is not exclusively pathological; only her way of excluding other women from her father's love is problematically pathological
But, as I already mentioned, this film per se is too cowardly to be Freudian
) The problem is that adult characters are as childish and naive and helpless as Emily is
And because of this characteristic weakness even the psychic who can see almost everything cannot do anything down-to-earth, and because of the same weakness the very story of the film is ended in a badly escapist way
In addition, special effects of this film are incredibly cheap and laughable
Although Stelvio Cipriani's music is noteworthily beautiful (indeed this one is so good that it seems to be worth having it alone), the film as a whole is nothing but a cheap B-film which can disappoint even the 1970s'-Italian- horror-film-lovers
After having seen the movie the first question arising in my mind was: Is this supposed to be irony or not? After reading a few comments about the character Doc Savage and the comic series, I knew this film was not meant to be ironic
So, the story tells us about an US-American Super-Doc saving a south American republic from evil
But this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous
The mandatory end-fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts I have ever seen
The film might be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example
I doubt Jigsaw was hip even at the time, the whole LSD theme married to a murder mystery being a patently obvious attempt to grab a young audience of the era without in the least truly showing any understanding of the sixties counterculture
The dated aspect aside, Jigsaw suffers from many problems, including overwrought acting, silly and stilted dialogue, LSD flashbacks that go on interminably long even after the point has been hammered home in the first 60 seconds, a failure to create any true suspense even though the actual plot is, on paper, a great vehicle to do just that, and an ending that is so trite and predictable (not to mention reminiscent of a lot of bad television shows) that the climax is actually an anti-climax
If it was a better movie, we might be able to suspend disbelief on a few things where it would help enjoyment, but the weaknesses are so glaring they only serve to highlight the improbabilities viewers might otherwise overlook
I saw Jigsaw on television and it is definitely late night TV fare meant to fill airspace and pass the time to kill somebody's insomnia rather than anything anybody ought to actively seek out
Evidently when you offer a actor enough money they will do anything
I am not sure how much John Rys-Daves got, but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even being associated with such a ROTTEN movie
The special effects were worse then effects from the 1950's B movies and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse
As to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion
The English was terribly accented and I think no one could really even speak English they just memorized how the words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character both "life-like" and real
My wife and I just finished this movie and I came onto to IMDb to commiserate with the reviewers that found this movie less than satisfactory
However, of the 10 pages of reviews, only a handful are negative
I feel that this movie is a great concept gone horribly awry and I want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie into the future
<br /><br />I admit, I'm more inspired to write reviews when I don't like a movie than as to when I do, so my handful of reviews are all negative
Still, that doesn't mean I'm biased towards not enjoying a movie, but I often find more eloquent reviews of movies I do enjoy
<br /><br />Paris je t'aime is the most pretentious movie I've seen in years
By using an "intelligent" concept and attaching some big talent to a couple of the WAY to many short stories, the movie ends up the worst of all worlds
It is art for arts sake, but something that a 2 year old could dream up and accomplish
Giving the director free reign of 5 minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment
Directors can't write, writers can't direct
(I'd like to throw in also that Clint Eastwood is overrated, but that is because he's an actor turn director {which rarely works, either})
<br /><br />What ends up on the screen is a garbled mess of short stories that don't make any sense, are not completed in 5 minutes and in total, spoil Paris to me
Why call it Paris je t'aime when a more apropos title is cluster f*ck? There are only a couple stories that are watchable, most notably the piece by Alfonso Cuarón, but everything else will fall into obscurity
The Coen brothers short is passable, but can you name a movie of theirs that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar? It's as if all the directors decided on doing whatever it is they want to do and chose Paris as the place to do it
As we all love Paris, present company included, we are blinded by the fact that this movie SUCKS
In fact, I think they put the directors names on each of the shorts because directors saw how poor of a film this is and decided to make sure they were blamed only for their 5 minutes
<br /><br />People, Natalie Portman is NOT a good actress
She is is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be yours
And Maggie Gyllenhaal, why?!? Are you people acting or just regurgitating performances from other movies? I'm looking at you Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), Elijah Wood (Sin City) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace)
<br /><br />One final comment on the acting: I give double kudos to Nick Nolte for acting and looking more humane than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again
Find his short on youtube as his 5 minutes are quite enjoyable
<br /><br />Writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have gotten it right
I'm thinking of Ernst Hemingway, Raymond Carver, F
Scott Fitzgerald, and John Cheever, just to name a few
It is much harder than writing a full novel and only the truly talented can accomplish this
It appears that only one director will live on in the annals of history
<br /><br />If you uphold Paris as a gem to be discovered and reflected through your own lenses with your own story, then don't expect to enjoy this movie at all
The directors either didn't care or were lazy
In either scenario, by the time you are reading this it means you rented it
Praise be that you didn't pay 10 dollars a head in theaters for it
A far as B-movies go, SCARECROW is one of those that are so bad, that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through
A lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck
He then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him
Apparently, the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers
This scarecrow, aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims, can also do Matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight
Also, why did he always look like a rotted corpse? Just like the two needless sequels that followed this, this isn't even worth a laugh
If the scale went negative I would be happier
Seeing Sushmita Sen was nice, and Nisha Kothari has a bright future but the producer and the director ruined any and all enjoyment in this story
The choice of angles, choice of lighting and well everything distracted from trying to remember what is the story
Oh, if the songs and dances haven't caused you to rip your ears off your head, first
25 hours, and been pretty good, kinda like "Seven Samurai" but the director and writer didn't go that direction, even if the "townsfolk" finally find their backbone and want to help
This movie fails on so many levels: editing, writing, photography angles, style, lighting, script - name any aspect of this film - it was BAD - probably the food from the caterer was bad too
I have never in 6 years of watching Indian (Bollywood) movies seen something this badly made
This movie is little more than poorly-made, fetish porn, and this is saying a lot considering the similar crap that was made in that era
This was recommended to me by friend as a "unique film experience
Just mediocre acting and poor attempts at shock art
A little bit of camp value, though I don't believe the makers of this film intended this
And yes, as a previous reviewer mentioned, it's sex with a guy in a bear suit
Or contact me, I'd be happy to sell you my copy for half price
<br /><br />I may have to see another of this particular director's films, as he seems to have a certain following
But if it's anything like this, I will again regret another 2 hours of my life gone forever
This movie should have been named Need For Speed: The Movie
For those who have not played the games Need For Speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot
The only thing about this movie that was A-Level were the cars
The acting seemed forced and scripted, the premise was flimsy at best, and the plot was almost nonexistent
I only really watched this movie to see how bad it was and, while it was pretty bad, it could have been worse
I just wish they had showed Eddie Griffin crashing the Enzo somewhere in the movie
All in all, don't pay for it, don't go out of your way to see it, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and there isn't anything else on, it's a decent distraction
Caught part of GEORGE 2 on TV recently, but couldn't get myself to watch it through to the end
Just awful! I can't even remember the plot
All I know is that George and Ursula were not the George and Ursula of the first movie, which was bad enough
There's a lot of scrambling around, but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy, it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes
Having the original voice of Ape the Ape back was not nearly enough to make me warm up to this
GEORGE 2 is probably the single worst sequel I have ever seen, and that is saying something
Jeez, because of IMDb's 10 lines rule, I have to keep typing when I have nothing more to say about this crapulastic made-for-TV sequel
Its a film that sits on the video shelf and gathers dust
Rent this one after you seen everything else
My wife like like this film better then I do, maybe its not that bad
<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most horrendous movies I have ever seen, Mazes and Monsters felt like I wasted 101 minutes of my life
The only redeeming quality of the movie were scenes that tried to be serious, but just ended up being funny since they were so bad
Evil Dead anyone? Unfortunately for M&M (fortunately for us) it did not develop a cult following and result in a trilogy
This movie tried to address a series of problems that the main character, Robbie (played by Hanks) encountered throughout the film
It ended up being a fear mongering video about stereotypes that helped fuel the D&D is the Devil movement in the 80s
<br /><br />If you want to avoid wasting your time and money, steer clear of this junk
- Even though the cover looks kinda interesting, which is why I guess my brother bought it, it in no way takes place in a fantasy realm, unless you consider New England or New York City to be such a place
I had to stop watching this film (a pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious film viewers) twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and dull enough to inspire yawns, not to mention that I was soon near tears over the $3
Joanna Pacula's acting and her awfully rendered Slavic accent are sufficiently terrible to set one to gritting one's teeth
I knew that two hours of her would be two hours too many
Both Breuer and Nietzsche are played by unremarkable actors of strikingly few talents
While we're on the topic of talent, Breuer's supercilious assistant appears to have been pulled out of a local acting troupe
All the public scenes looked staged, with the extras walking mechanically about in their Sunday best
Turning this film off was far more satisfying than turning it on
"Arahan" adds nothing positive to the Kung Fu genre
To compare this confused motion picture with the inspired craziness and quality of Stephen Chow's films is a mistake
<br /><br />Firstly the fight scenes are nothing new
All that is presented here has been done before and better by the likes of Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan
Fights in intelligent Motion Pictures need logic
There seems no point serving blows that have no damaging effect as in the "Matrix" sequels
<br /><br />The attractive female lead So-Yi Yoon captivated the screen but she never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role as Ziyi Zhang had done so easily in "House Of Flying Daggers"
Having a Martial Arts background serves well in Kung Fu movies
To cast actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake (See Aya Ueto in "Asumi") unless you are a very talented director which as "Arahan" proves Seung-wan Ryoo is not
) You're a big fan of any of the main stars
) If you really want to check out the first time Lucille Ball was seen with red hair
Well, maybe I'm just having a bad run with Hindi movies lately
I asked the video store guy for Apharan (Prakash Jha) but being a new release, wasn't available yet
It turned out to be the stupidest Hindi movie I've seen (and I've seen quite a few)
No wonder BOllywood is the laughing stock of the whole world! If IMDb had negative ratings, I would give Garam Masala a -10
<br /><br />I remember seeing a TV show about the jazzy premiere they had for its release in Mumbai
All the usual celebs and their sideys showed up
For some strange reason, people expect good stuff from Piyadarashan
I did not like Hulchul, Hungama, or his other films
Hulchul, probably dubbed from Tamil or Telugu, came across as very loud, in-your-face fare that again didn't make much sense except in a Bollywood flick
This latest piece of utter CXXP proved that this guy has NO BRAINS
Who made him a director, even a Bollywood director at that??? <br /><br />Anyhow, to the film now
What starts off as a romantic escapade turns into a non-sensical woman-hunt
Two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment (isn't it similar to No Entry where the 2 dudes work for a gossip magazine and share an office? Jezuz Christ, now they're copying their own stories!) Well anyways, there's some cook or chef that tries to help one of the dodos in his quest for multi-lateral love (aka multi-tasking + multi-timing)
And how sadistic to wallow in their own filth! For which audience did they make it - the poor illiterate Indian masses (700 Mil at last count) or the well-heeled NRI desis staying in Phoren? Either ways it doesn't matter
Neither group has any clue what makes a good movie and probably deserves such god-awful stuff
<br /><br />Its a short review because there's nothing to write about but the usual bag of F-grade garbage
Bollywood should change its name to Follywood
And yes, this review is much better than the movie itself
Oh a vaguely once famous actress in a film where she plays a mother to a child
It`s being shown on BBC 1 at half past midnight , I wonder if
yup it`s a TVM <br /><br />You`ve got to hand it to TVM producers , not content on making one mediocre movie , they usually give us two mediocre movies where two themes are mixed together and NOWHERE TO HIDE is no different
The first theme is a woman in danger theme cross pollinated with a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme which means we have a scene of the heroine surviving a murder attempt followed by a scene having her son Sam ask why she divorced ? And being a TVM she answers that the reason is " That people change " rather than say something along the lines like " I`m a right slapper " or Your daddy cruises mens public toilets for sex " as does happen in real life divorce cases
And it`s young Sam I feel sorry for , not only are his parents divorced but he`s as thick as two short planks
Actually since he`s so stupid he deserves no sympathy because he`s unaware that a man flushing stuff down a toilet is a drug dealer , unaware that you might die if someone shoots at you , and unaware that I LOVE LUCY is painfully unfunny
If only our own childhoods were so innocent , ah well as Orwell said " Ignorance is strength "
Oh hold on Sam is suddenly an expert on marine life ! Is this character development or poor scripting ? I know what one my money`s on
And strange that Sam the boy genuis hasn`t noticed that if the story is set in 1994 then why do people often wear clothes , drive cars and ride trains from the 1950s ? But as it turns out during a plot twist it`s the mother who`s the dummy
Then there`s a final plot twist that left me feeling like an idiot for watching thi
And so the great rewriting of history continues Hollywood style
<br /><br />This was senseless ridiculous rubbish
<br /><br />Its shocks me that such an amazing amount of money can be spent to produce what is the most contrived, poorly acted inaccurate film I have ever seen
<br /><br />Nic Cage's brief flirtation with serious acting appears to be over
I can only assume that Leaving Las Vegas was a glitch in an otherwise litany of dreadful films
<br /><br />Diane Kruger proves that her performance in Troy was no fluke, she really can't act
<br /><br />Harvey Keitel should be ashamed of himself for working on such tripe
<br /><br />Only recommended for those either recovering from a recent lobotomy or people of an opinion that America invented the world
Despite being a huge fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' movies, it wasn't until about 6 years ago that I first saw 'Follow the Fleet'
I knew all the songs from an old Astaire/Rogers record (yes, vinyl) but knew nothing of the plot
<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the songs are catchy and Ginger Rogers' character is sweet and funny, you just can't like 'Bake Baker'
While trying to make up to his longtime partner, he continually sabotages her career
His character doesn't have the usual humour and elan of the other films' Astaire characters
<br /><br />Worth watching for the songs and a great solo tap routine by Ginger Rogers
My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast  even for the supporting characters, none of which helps this movie really
I have to admit though, Tom Hank's cameo almost made it worth it  what was that about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - by far a classic! The premise is good
Basinger's character, struggling with existence as a Pink Lady, is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales
This happens as Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by
As they both make their way, they have numerous run-ins with Elvis impersonators who on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas
Soon, the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer
Unfortunately, premise doesn't mean the movie was good
<br /><br />When watching this movie, imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity aren't really important
It is much more enjoyable to just watch Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn't really make sense
The movie tries hard, but ultimately falls way way way short
Ultimately, it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny
<br /><br />It isn't the worst, but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this one Don't say I didn't warn you
I tend to love everything the great late Paul Naschy (R
While not all films starring Naschy are great, they all have a specific charm that can be found nowhere but in Naschy-flicks, and they are always entertaining
There is no rule without exception, however, as "El Mariscal Del Infierno" aka
While the film does have the specific Naschy-flick-charm, it sadly drags far too much and gets really, really dull in-between
Naschy stars as the evil Baron Gilles De Lancré, who oppresses the people and uses black magic and bloody rituals to stay in power
When Gaston de Malebranche (Guillermo Bredeston), who fought side by side with Gilles De Lancré against the British, learns about the Baron's evil behavior, he decides to turn against his former comrade in arms and help the people free themselves from the satanic Baron's tyranny
<br /><br />Directed by León Klimovsky, who is best known for directing Naschy in "La Noche De Walpurgis" ("The Werewolf Vs
The Vampire Woman", 1971), the film was scripted by Naschy himself
Naschy often scripted his own films, and one must say that he mostly did a better, more original job than it is the case here
"El Mariscal Del Infierno" is mostly built up as a historical adventure rather than a Horror film, and it gets quite boring throughout the middle
It often resembles the Sword and Sandal films from the 50s, only that this film is set in medieval times
The Satanic part was probably only added because the great Paul Naschy's name is linked to the Horror genre
The film has its good parts: Paul Naschy giving weird speeches, Paul Naschy looking weird, Paul Naschy doing Satanic stuff, Paul Naschy torturing innocent victims, etc
But sadly, most of the film concentrates on the boring hero and the good guys, and these moments are boring
The female cast members are nice to look at, but, unlike most Naschy films, this one features no nudity and sleaze
There is some gore, but it mostly looks clumsy and isn't as fun too look at as it is the case with most other Naschy films
Overall, "El Mariscal Del Infierno" is only worth a look for my fellow Naschy-enthusiasts
There are dozens of films starring the Spanish Horror deity which should be seen before this one, such as "El Jorobado De La Morgue" ("The Hunchback of the Morgue", 1973), "La Orgia De Los Muertos" ("The Hanging Woman", 1973), "El Espanto Surge De La Tumba" ("Horror Rises From The Tomb", 1973), "Latidos De Panico" ("Panic Beats", 1983), "Rojo Sangre" (2004), or any of the 'Waldemar Daninsky' werewolf films
Michael Callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems, nonetheless, to be regarded as a perfect "catch" by any woman that runs across him; could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co-produced the film? He's a "hero" whom it's very difficult to empathize with, so the movie is in trouble right from the start
It has the production values of a TV-movie (check out that head made of clay or something, near the end), and the ending cheats in a way that I can't reveal, in case anyone wants to see the movie (highly unlikely)
Let's just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows
Is nothing else on TV? Are you really bored? Well, then watch Phat Beach
However, don't rent it and definitely DO NOT buy it
<br /><br />I watched this on TV and found myself laughing at certain points
I did not laugh long and I did not laugh hard
However, there were subtle jokes and comments I laughed at
If you are looking for an extremely funny "hood" movie then watch Friday
If you are looking for a powerful emotional movie (something that this movie tries at
kind of) watch something like hoop dreams or Jason's Lyric
If you are lookin for some good black "booty" go watch a Dominique Simone porn flick, because the nudity in this movie is nearly non-existent
However, if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable, go ahead and watch it
I feel obliged to explain my actions though
I've basically never seen such an armateur production, and I mean that in all senses of the word
Although the physical camera work, boom MIC operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable, unfortunately its not the only areas
<br /><br />Unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot, this unfortunately has an awful script, awful acting and worst of all, awful annoying characters
<br /><br />It's a crime that for the every independent film that gets, distribution like Haiku Tunnel, there's a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths
I don't know who the Kornbluth brothers know at Sony, but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution
I'm quite bemused as to why they picked this up
<br /><br />The ONLY part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title
However, the reason for that is even a let down
I hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it
I've seen a lot of films in my time, and I'm very forgiving when in the cinema, but this was too much
I'll never forget 'tunnel', for marking an important point in my life experience of cinema
With a cast list like this one, I expected far better
Venessa Redgrave spent the majority of the movie lying in bed
The best actresses in the world cannot make anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the entire movie
The plot summary says that a secret is revealed to the daughters as their mother comes closer to death
The thing is, she never tells her daughters anything except cryptic advice to be happy
All the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped
I also felt that the back and forth between the past and present was unnecessary
It seemed as if the idea was stolen either from the book the Da Vinci Code in which the device was used to increase suspense, or from The Notebook in which they used the device to create the never ending romance of the story's main characters
Either way it was a cheap device in this movie because it didn't work to create anything
It was a way to attempt suspense in a movie that has none
I left wondering why good movies can't be written for women
I picked up Time Changer because it looked like a nice low-budget scifi time travel movie and I was in the mood for something like that
The description said it had something to do with some biblical stuff and time travel but I didn't expect a fundamentalist Christian film!<br /><br />The movie had decent special effects and an interesting premise that could have gone places and been far more interesting than it ended up being
Our hero, who is a bible professor from the 1890s, eventually travels forward to the 2000s and finds that modern life is filled with the influences of evil - Jesus is nowhere to be found
This wonderful technological feat is accomplished with the assistance of a fellow bible teacher who somehow managed to invent a functional HG-Wells-style time machine
The movie starts to lose some credibility at this point, which is unfortunate because this happens very early in the film
Earlier (or perhaps immediately later, can't remember for certain), our hero professor was seen teaching what appeared to be a science class where he claimed that scientific findings could only be considered validated if it could be matched with what the bible says
What should be obvious to anyone is that this is clearly not what the scientific method is about, however it is presented such that the filmmakers appear to prefer the point of view that science is useful only if it supports their claims and otherwise is not useful
<br /><br />In any case, that belief is perfectly valid and sensible in the context of the character at the time
So, if we accept that as the fact of life for these bible professors, then obviously the professor who went and invented the time machine isn't a very strong believer as I don't think there's any evidence (and none was offered) for the physics of time travel in the bible
So immediately there's a problem with mixed messages and credibility there, but never mind
<br /><br />After the professor is convinced to take the leap into the future, the shock of modern technology was handled quite well in most cases
It was also fun to not have it pinned down to an exact year (as the character is reading the date off a newspaper to himself, a car honks a horn and it scares him into not finishing the date: it's just two thousand and
Some of the shock went on a little too long, though
For instance, the car was one of the first things he encountered when he arrived and around two days later he's invited to a church movie night and takes a ride in a van
He sticks his head out the window like a dog might, is scared by the headlights and the starting engine, etc
That seemed a bit off since he'd been there a few days by this point and the city appeared to be quite busy with traffic
The rest of the tech shock was well done - especially his first encounter with the TV which was delayed because he didn't even realize what it was until he saw a kid watching one and using a remote
<br /><br />Unfortunately, our hero predictably starts to preach to virtually everyone he meets as if he's an authority on all life and religion just because he's from the past and is an elder
Eventually he gets himself a brief moment in the spotlight at the church he had been visiting where he proceeds to explain his concept of Christianity to them in a long monologue that was supposed to be moving and insightful, but mostly was just more of the same
A couple of husbands in the church begin to get a funny feeling about this guy (go figure) and investigate his name
They eventually conclude that he either is a time traveler or is impersonating this long dead bible professor and decide to find out which it is
The movie frames these guys as non-believer bad guys for being skeptical
<br /><br />Just before the professor is to head back to his own time, he is confronted by those two men
In an effort to avoid being arrested or hauled away, he eventually breaks into an almost insane-like rant about how Jesus is coming soon and that he's a prophet so they should listen to him
Just in time, he's whisked away and one of the husbands wonders if perhaps this is the rapture he'd heard so much about
<br /><br />The irony is that this essentially means the professor became a self-proclaimed (and most likely false) prophet claiming to know that the rapture was near and he was sent by God when truthfully he was sent by his fellow bible professor and did not have any God-given knowledge (that was stated or even hinted at)
<br /><br />As I understand it, Revelation claims that the time of the end is only for God to know and at the end of the film we see the inventor professor trying (and failing) to send a bible into the future
Clearly he's trying to determine the exact date of the end times - which he shouldn't be able to know! Essentially, the entire premise of the movie cancels itself out because by being so insistent on their religious beliefs and how certain things are for God to know only, it means there couldn't ever BE a time machine in the first place because then mankind could find out something that only God should know! The entire movie's premise collapses and makes the whole thing basically worthless as it undermines it's own credibility in the end
when he remade Broadway BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950)
Recasting Bing Crosby as DAN BROOKS did not help a screenplay that was 'dated' in 34 let alone 50
This sad film has entire scenes lifted from the original with many of the supporting cast repeating their roles, unless they were dead
Though being older did not seem to matter to the Director
Nor that the Cars and Clothes in the background plates from 1934 did not seem match up too 1950s' standards
Not even 'der Bingel' singing can redeem this effort
<br /><br />We rated both the original and the remake IMDb Four****Stars
Frank's touch was long gone and all that was left was CAPRA-CORN
After floundering around the 50's making some educational documentaries he wound up his career remaking LADY FOR A DAY (1933) as POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (1961)
Again a fine cast was let down on that IMDb Six******Star effort compared too the originals Eight********Stars
Sometimes it is better to quit while you were still ahead, right after STATE OF THE UNION (1948)
We all know that countless duds have graced the 80s slasher genre and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust
Maybe that's a bit hastey but damn if "Slaughter High" wasn't terribly unoriginal, even for a slasher flick
Pretty much, the plot involves a kid who experienced a Carrie-like shower humiliation in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek out revenge on a group of former-bullies who all show up to reminisce
As you'd expect, they are killed off steadily by a masked madman on April 1st by means of electrocution, burning, hanging, and chemically altered beer
I've got a number of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie, but considering the ending, I feel the need to discard my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time
This piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow
The sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again! Things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear
Was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production?<br /><br />Poor film making aside, the story is vile just sick evil sh*t If you like rape, murder and self harm this is right up your alley
And if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed
I watched almost all of it but had to turn off after I seen someones brains blown out
Never before have I seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty
one may ask why? the characters snarl, yell, and chew the scenery without any perceptible reason except someone wanted to make a movie in barcelona
billie baldwin, is that the right one?, is forgettable in the cop/estranged-husband/loving-father-of-cute-little-blond-girl role
the story seems to have been cut and pasted from the scenes thrown away from adventure films in the last three years
ellen pompeo's lack of charisma is a black hole that seems to suck the energy out of every scene she is in
her true acting range is displayed when she takes her blouse off as the movies careens from one limp chase scene to another
unfortunately, the directing rarely goes bad enough to be camp or a parody
it is all just cliché, familiar in every respect
the director cast his own daughter as the precocious brat probably because no respectable agent would have permitted a client to ruin a career by being in such a lame, contrived and uninteresting movie
the only heist here is the theft of the investor's money and the viewer's time
Saw a screener of this before last year's Award season, didn't really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended, but whatever, maybe for exposure, at the least, but the movie was a convoluted mess
Sure, some parts were funny in a black humor kind of way, but none of the characters felt very real to me at all
There was not one person that I could connect with, and I think that is where it failed for me
Sure, the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive towards Scientology, WOW! What a grand idea
let's see if that already hasn't been mined to the point of futility
The whole ordeal feels fake, from the lighting, the casting, the screenplay to the horrible visual effects(which is supposed to be intentional, I can tell, and so can everyone else, no one is laughing with you though)
Anyways, I hope it makes it out for sale on DVD at least, I wouldn't want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into get completely unnoticed
This is a dry and sterile feature filming on one of most interesting events in WWII and in history of warfare behind the front line
Bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing Hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event
There is no character development at all and idea that Tom Cruise suppose to play a high rank commander that questions his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and treason is completely insane
I believe that Mister Bin would play it better
Generally speaking, film pretty much looks as a cheep copy of good German TV movie "Stauffenberg" from 2004, but can't get close to that film regarding any movie aspect whatsoever
However, movie obviously gets its financial goal with pop-corn audience that cherishes Hollywood fast-mood blood and shallow art values
There are so many incorrect statements in this so-called "documentary" that I found myself shouting at the television
<br /><br />Bart Sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking DVD, but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claims
<br /><br />He relies on either being inaccurate, not telling the full story, or the old favourite "government always lies to us" innuendos, and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claims
<br /><br />What's more, his "exclusive" or "unreleased" footage is freely available over the internet from various sites
<br /><br />Further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews, and has used creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinions
<br /><br />All of the claims made by Mr Sibrel about "inaccuracies", "mistakes", or "whistleblowing" in the Apollo programme have been thoroughly disproven
<br /><br />How do I get that 40-odd minutes of my life back
I didn't think the French could make a bad movie, but I was, clearly, very wrong
As has been said before, this film essentially uses its title character as a point of departure; its portrayal of her life and person have little or nothing to do with the real Artemisia Gentileschi
<br /><br />The script is awful -- pretentious, stilted, and vapid -- and its rewriting of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that all too often makes its living by distorting, rather than retelling, history
Along with some fairly decent set design, Valentina Cervi's physical charms are the primary asset of this movie, and it's obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too; they waste no time in contriving various "erotic" sequences which have far more to do with titillation than with plot or character development
Unfortunately, the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal cannot, and does not, sustain this movie
The acting is unremarkable, and the score is all too generic despite an interesting chord or two
The cinematography is OK, and there are some pretty colors, but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distorted-lens effects more appropriate for a 1960s freakout movie than a costume drama
In any event, the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on Artemisia's body, and all too seldom on her paintings
<br /><br />All told, a near-complete failure
It's not intelligent or tasteful enough to be a serious film, and it's too slow and pretentious to work as soft-core pornography
Mind, my friends and I saw the movie based off it's title alone
It's cute, though obvious in it's plot and direction-- you know where the movie is going within the first five minutes
My main contention with the plot is that while it remains tolerably consistent, they never explain a lot of the things behind the characters
An alcoholic father, overworked mother, stressed-out sister
that's a bad family, but aside from the occasional mention from the sister, there's not any resolution
I was also confused as to the scene with the bottles
<br /><br />The writing is a secondary concern
the kids weren't bad actors, but their script left a lot to be desired
Unfortunately, what could have been a cute niche movie was pushed aside for a single, blah special effect, lame scripting, and a glaringly obvious plot
This is a low-budget "Scream" style movie
"Maddy" is a new worker at a conspicuously-unnamed office, where she meets and starts a relationship with her co-worker "Chris"
During a hot tub-party, Chris and his friends convince Maddy they belong to a "Murder Club" where everyone has killed someone for kicks
When Maddy loses it and kills someone for real, hijinks ensue
<br /><br />The film looks good, and there are the requisites for this genre and budget level (nudity, gore, maybe a few cameos from slightly bigger stars than the cast), but, after the credits roll, you'll ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching it
"Unhinged" is one strange little film, a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre
It's hard to really write a satisfying review of this film simply because of the fact that the film is so unique
It's plot is fairly overdone--three young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car crash and end up stranded at the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter
Very quickly, the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic
On top of that, the mother and daughter seem to have a very, very strange relationship, as they quarrel intensely in front of their houseguest at dinner
The old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sneaking guys in at night to sleep with them
Halfway through the film, when one girl finally decides she better wander off to find help, the killing begins
<br /><br />As far as the acting goes, this film is at the bottom of the barrel
NONE of the three stranded girls can act, particularly the "lead" girl
It is almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same, wooden tone throughout the film
The mother and daughter are better, but not much
The film is also quite dull in parts and really, really drags
The killings are gruesome, but nothing we haven't seen before
However, as mentioned on here, the film really gains points with it brilliantly disturbing and gory ending
It comes totally from left field and has the same shock value as the ending the the camp classic "Sleepaway Camp
" Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from horrendous acting and boring, boring pacing
The isolated, creepy looking mansion and the dark, foreboding lighting does give the film a grainy realism, but that is quickly shattered when one of the characters attempts to act
It may be worth it if you can stick it out until the end, but I say you are better off just fast forwarding to the last 10 minutes
i'm being generous giving this movie 2 stars
the line about "have you even seen the wizard of oz" was the best part for me! with terrible writing and acting like displayed in this movie it's no wonder so many are taken in by worthless tv reality shows
do yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit a royals baseball game, your gonna be glad ya did
I am unfortunate to see it is a terrible movie
Jamal Woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to portray Notorious B
's real son, Christopher Jordan Wallace as Notorious B
Unfortunately, he is not convincing enough to pay tribute to his father
Derek Luke is just as unconvincing as Sean "Puffy" Combs
In a nutshell, no one is convincing enough to play their roles here
The big problem with this are these are actual people they are playing
It was boring, and did not give any information about Notorious B
that fans and non-fans alike did not already know
I was especially disappointed with Angela Bassett, a very good actress wasted here as Voletta Wallace
The movie slugs and slugs along thinking that Notorious B
I am unfortunate to say that that happened
I was expecting so much out of it, but unfortunately I didn't get anything I wanted from this
I think you should definitely skip this one
This movie was supposed to have depicted a 'ladie's man' bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all
However, I did not care for his mission to settle down, because I didn't care for his character
I don't understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him
He should've at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing, but to no avail
Just because he is a musician does not make him sexy
Not to mention, the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous
Does this man have any shame what-so-ever? Had he tidied up, and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character, but alas, his character was bland and boring
<br /><br />Gina Gershon's character was unnecessarily British
She could've just as easily been an uptight out-of-towner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor British accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie
<br /><br />The only two characters I cared for were the fish and frog
Now those two had chemistry! Academy nominations for both STAT! Plot holes, lack of character development, horrible acting, unnecessary drama, cliché moments
- Let me start by saying that I understand that Invasion of the Star Creatures was meant to be a parody of the sci-fi films of the 50s
I understand that none of it is to be taken seriously
The problem I have is that none of it works
A parody should be funny and this one just isn't
Not once during the entire runtime did I so much as crack a smile
In general, I am easily entertained, but I couldn't find a sliver of entertainment anywhere in Invasion of the Star Creatures
<br /><br />- I knew I was in trouble right from the beginning
The two "stars" make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable - a water hose they can't control that gets them both wet
These two come off as Bowery Boys wannabes
Why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the Bowery Boys is beyond me
After the less than illustrious beginning, the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences, dancing Indians, vegetable men, decoder rings, and other assorted unfunny bits
<br /><br />- I bought this on the double feature DVD with Invasion of the Bee Girls
That movie is Academy Award winning stuff in comparison with Invasion of the Star Creatures
People tried to make me believe that the premise of this rubbishy supernatural horror/thriller was inspired by the actual last words spoken by an authentic serial killer (whose name escapes me at the moment)
Whilst awaiting his execution in the electric chair, he claimed that his soul would return to life and continue to go on a never-ending murder spree
It's not a highly original idea to revolve a horror film on, by the way
Other low-budget turkeys implemented the exact same basic premise, like "House 3", "Shocker" and "Ghost in the Machine"
a "Pentagram") isn't a completely terrible effort, but the script overly reverts to clichés and lacks genuine thrills
The film starts off as an okay, albeit mundane serial killer flick in which obsessive cop-hero Lou Diamond Philips pursues a maniac who carves bloody pentagrams into the chests of his victims
He receives unexpected help from a spiritual medium, played by the gorgeous and underrated Tracy Griffith
She leads him to the killer but also begs not to execute him, as that would result in an even bigger catastrophe! Thanks to Tess' helpful hints, Detective Logan quickly captures the killer and celebrates his death penalty, but Patrick Channing made a pact with Satan Himself and returns to the rotten streets of California to do some more killing
"The First Power" gets pretty bad once the murderer reincarnates as a vengeful spirit
Instead of using his newly gained satanic powers to wipe out the entire world (that's what I would do in his position), Channing simply prefers to play cat and mouse games with his nemesis the copper
He annoyingly calls him "Buddy-Boy" all the time and possesses the bodies of Logan's friends and colleagues in order to trick him
Even though never really boring or poorly realized, it's a very weak film to endure, mostly because you constantly get the feeling of déjà-vu
Writer/director Robert Resnikoff shamelessly uses every dreadful cliché (the killer got sexually abused as a child) and even the players' lines can easily be predicted
As soon as Griffith explains she's able to predict the future, you just know that, somewhere at some point in the film, she's going to say the ridiculously overused line "I tell people who to live their lives, but my own life is a mess"
Lou Diamond Philips' performance is adequate enough, but it's rather difficult to take that youthful rebel of "La Bamba" and "Stand And Deliver" serious as a tough copper
There also are decent supportive roles for Mykelti Williamson ("Forrest Gump"), Carmen Argenziano ("When a Stranger Calls") and B-movie horror legend David Gale ("Re-Animator") appears in a minuscule cameo at the very beginning of the film
Curiously, Season 6 of the Columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts, based on this outing for the "man-in-the-mac" and also "Fade into Murder"
<br /><br />Furthermore, it is not a coincidence that Peter S
Feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts (incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard here)
<br /><br />This adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material
The story is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods of boring conversation
<br /><br />Columbo is also shadowed by a colleague here(similar to "Last Salute to the Commodore") but the entertainment value is minimal
To add to this, Celeste's Holm characterisation, which is intended to provide comedy, induces embarrassment rather than laughs
<br /><br />The script wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift Columbo the case, though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crime
<br /><br />Ironically, what turns out to be, arguably, Columbo's worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series
He quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircut/manicure at the same time
The next 5 minutes are hilarious - it's just that Columbo's hair is so perfectly groomed, then he can't afford to pay the bill and then, when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he keeps glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstyle!<br /><br />Sadly, this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes
<br /><br />For Columbo completionists only
This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States
) However despite the fact this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site
I realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow
The only one even mediocre is the excellent Ossie Davis
But even he couldn't make up for all the actors (including the one playing him as a young man) absolutely atrocious acting
Granted the script was terribly cliché, but even then you have got to get some decent actors! I wouldn't recommend this to anybody because it is so poorly done in every category
Read some books about the true story of the U
S Mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve
Back in my days as an usher "Private Lessons" played at the 4-plex I was working
It was a sleeper hit selling out Friday and Saturday nights for several weeks
I never got around to seeing it but saw that it was on cable this last weekend, so I decided to give it a shot
What I witnessed for the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and one that made me terribly uncomfortable to watch
<br /><br />The basic story is a teenage boy lusts after his sexy maid (Sylvia Kristel)
She, too, seems to feel an attraction towards the boy but for more sinister reasons
So we get scenes of the boy watching her undress and her inviting him in to watch
<br /><br />Eric Brown, as the teenage boy, has to be one of the worst actors I have ever seen
His "scared" reactions to every time Sylvia takes off a piece of clothing or when she touches him are horrible
I didn't laugh a single time during this piece of junk
<br /><br />And let's not get started on the subplot of the maid and chauffeur planning to extort money from the kid
Let's just say it involves faking a death, burying a body
I could go on and on but it gets more ridiculous
<br /><br />The sex scenes are the worst I have ever seen
Even though Eric Brown was older then he looked, the fact is he looks like a baby
It appears he has no idea how to kiss a woman (if THAT was acting then maybe I should re-think my criticisms of Brown) and it just came too close to bordering on child pornography to be erotic
I have never been so turned off by a sex scene even though Miss Kristel is quite beautiful with and without clothes
<br /><br />**SPOILER WARNING** I must make mention of the last scene
To me it's just plain sick but I can remember audiences cheering as the film freeze framed and dissolved into credits
Our hero returns to school and begins a flirtation with one of the female teachers
He asks her out for dinner and she gives him a look as if Tom Cruise has just asked her out
She nods affirmatively and he walks away, smiling at the camera in triumph
GIVE ME A BREAK! Yes I am sure teachers all over would just risk everything for a plain looking teenage kid
<br /><br />I will never understand the appeal this film had in 1982
Certainly it was more then the nudity because there were plenty of teen sex comedies with nudity that bombed at the box office
And to think that these same teenagers that cheered that movie 22 years ago are now working their way up corporate ladders and possibly helping to run this country
Tom Wolfe's sprawling, brilliantly observed satiric novel of life among New York snobbery gets a glossy look here but is nevertheless not well served
The film suffers not merely from the miscasting of everyman Tom Hanks as an uncaring Yuppie, Kewpie-doll Melanie Griffith as a manipulative southern belle and Bruce Willis (?!) as the darling of New York's literati
The most serious miscasting was in the director's chair
Robert Altman might have breathed life into these unlikeable characters and made them interesting, but Brian De Palma, for all of his visual sophistication, has never had an eye for the nuances of the human experience
The resulting film looks good but seems blah toward its subject of dehumanization in favor of status
Honestly, if a satire does not make the viewer angry, what is the point
In Hazzard County, Georgia, cousins Bo and Luke Duke (Scott, Knoxville) and their cousin Daisy Duke (Jessica Simpson) run moonshine made by their Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson) while avoiding the local authority, Boss Hog (Burt Reynolds)
Their problems with the Boss are only beginning as they learn he's been plotting to strip mine the town for valuable ores found below it
<br /><br />I have never seen the TV show and after watching the movie, I'm not going to start any time soon
I like stupid comedies but this one didn't offer many laughs
It was a pretty dull picture with the first hour being really hard to sit through
The second part was a little better but this film was still a missed opportunity
The film focused on Bo and Luke way too much
The characters in general weren't very interesting and the actors portraying them didn't do a very good job
I wasn't expecting it to be good in the first place but none of the leads were very funny
Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville both give below average performances
The latter was pretty good as Stifler but he tries way too hard here
The latter just seems to be looking for a paycheck and nothing else
Jessica Simpson isn't known for her acting nor is she really known for her singing
She's famous for having her own reality show and for saying really dumb things
It doesn't matter though because she doesn't really appear in the movie and the character she plays isn't complex or anything
Willie Nelson also has a minor role and he doesn't do anything special
<br /><br />The screenplay was written by John O'Brien and he made two films prior to the Dukes of Hazzard
The first one was Cradle to the Grave, which was okay
The second one was Starsky and Hutch which was pretty funny
He doesn't do a good job here though as the story is a mess
He also forgot to add jokes and a few other things that would have made this film work better
The movie is also pretty long for a comedy
Okay, 106 minutes isn't exactly long but it feels so much longer because there's very little humor in the first hour
I think comedies should be kept short or else they have to find a lot of material to cover the entire running time
The Dukes of Hazzard barely has enough funny gags to keep it going for thirty minutes let alone 106 minutes
The car sequences were average and they don't save an already troubled film
In the end, Dukes of Hazzard may appeal to a few people but most people will probably find it dull and it's better if you just skip it
This film is just another distortion, among many distortions, on the so-called 'sins of consumerism'
Please note that 'Reverend Billy', an actor (Bill Talen), is nothing more than a bureaucrat against the 'sins of consumerism'
We might want to ask are questions, like: What does 'Reverend Billy' do for a living? How does he make his money? Does he make his living off his 'tax-deductible' organization? How does the Internal Revenue justify this as a 'tax-deductible' church or organization? <br /><br />Everyone knows that Christmas is commercialized, but it affords one day out of a whole year in which people have an opportunity to be charitable, and allows a significant number of people to spend time with their families, friends, or extended families
Everyone does not spend time with their families, friends, or extended families
But, holidays and vacation time give people that chance and opportunity
Yes, America does have more than its share of problems--but, with perseverance, Americans have and always make it through great difficulties
And, even in times of strife, America has proved itself to be the greatest country in the world
That happens when Americans pull together and unite, rather than to separate and divide
Yes, there are problems with corporations and monopolies, but it will take Americans to bring back the small businesses, along with the ethics to responsibly care for people living in our individual communities
Yes, globalization has brought us its share of problems, but it will take Americans to bring production back to America
government need to learn how to stay on a budget, no matter how large or small it may be, and we must stop our dependence on credit
Our over-reliance on credit will make, and keep us poor, from the cradle to the grave
It is important to buy--but, if we buy less, we will rely less on credit
And, if we are able to save, even a small amount of money, we will have money for a rainy day
Not to say that, as Americans, we will gain an equal share of wealth
Wealth is not guaranteed, and has never been guaranteed
But, stratification teaches us that only a small percentage of Americans hold most of America's wealth
There is a good proximity that you or I can reach the level of the upper, middle class
And, who knows what can happen from there?!? Be positive, work hard--and, at the very least, you and I will be able to reach at least some (if not all) of our dreams
In life, nothing is guaranteed, but we always have that something to reach for
And, if you or I don't have dreams, we might as well be dead
In America, there is always room for plenty of hopes and dreams
As individuals, we are a part of the pack, but we always can become the leader of the pack
<br /><br />It has always been my experience that churches and religion do offer nothing more than additional distortions, but I pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs, values, and perspectives
But, as far as the distortions expressed, within this film, I do not have any faith in such beliefs, values, and perspectives
I rank this film with a 1 out of 10--but, in all honesty and truth, this film deserves a zero
This film has no integrity, and I cannot recommend it
Right out in plain sight this other guy shoots him
He's got some bodyguards and they whack the killer, but a reporter gets interested
She goes to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked
She walks in, and corners one bodyguard, but he doesn't feel like talking
Anyway, her editor discourages her from working on this lame story
She goes to see the killer's sister & mom
A few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time-- somebody blows up their trailer-- huge ball of fire
Then she searches out the bodyguard from the hospital
She finds him hungover on his boat, but a minute later they're both underwater sucking on a scuba tank 'cause three guys are trying to whack them (and have blown up the boat big time-- huge ball of fire)
The reporter and the bodyguard whack two of the guys who are trying to whack them
<br /><br />In the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street, there's a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse, some car chases with wreckage & death, a fake suicide, etc
<br /><br />Great stuff, but what the reporter and the bodyguard can't figure is: why in hell the original guy got whacked
What's the motivation? Of course, it might help us to figure out why the reporter's even interested
Through almost all of this she's the only reporter on the story
Not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies
True, the original guy who got whacked wasn't exactly a celebrity
Yeah, the one who lives in the White House
Oh, and the bodyguard is a Secret Service agent
<br /><br />Is that the spoiler?<br /><br />It should be
After all there are no TV cameras, no other print reporters, no bloggers
just another one of those police blotter crimes
<br /><br />So what's the spoiler?<br /><br />Lemme think
<br /><br />No! Wait! The spoiler is that his wife did it! Yeah
She was p---ed because the President was fooling around
She's really sharp, huh? But how the hell could anybody ever figure that out? Why would anyone bother? After all, only one reporter is even interested
It was so dumb I just had to keep watching
And it only got dumber! That's the real spoiler! But even though I've told you, you've got to see it to believe it
It doesn't take long to see why Code Name: Diamond Head didn't make it onto the network schedules
The TV pilot movie doesn't get past the credits before it's obvious just how bad it's going to be
Maybe I missed something, because the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense
Based on what I got out of the muddled mess, a terrorist or thief or something named "Tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon
The world's dullest secret agent, Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), is out to stop him
There might have been more, but trust me  it really doesn't matter anyway
<br /><br />Action movies should have action
There's none of that in Code Name: Diamond Head
I've seen others use the word "turgid" to describe this made for TV snoozer  and it's better than any one word description I can come up with
None of the characters is in the least bit exciting or worth caring about
And Roy Thinnes makes for the worst leads imaginable
His charisma is just slightly north of a slug
Ian McShane is easily the best thing the movie has going for it, but unfortunately for everyone else involved, it doesn't appear he was going to be back as a regular cast member
Now if McShane had been cast in the series lead, well then you might have had something
<br /><br />I'm quickly discovering that these Gawd awful 70s made-for-TV movies make great Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes
And that goes double if Quinn Martin was involved
So while I may only give the movie a 3/10, I rate Episode #608 a 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale
This has got to be the cheesiest, stupidest, most retarded monster film of all time
It's a complete joke that this even surfaced into theaters
This is sort of like watching the Loch Ness monster in rural America
This movie deserves to be thrown in a toilet and completely forgotten
The people involved in this moronic pile of trash need to be lobotomized
Wait! Maybe I'm giving them too much credit
I'm sure they were lobotomized before the filming
How else can one explain the utter and sheer stupidity that this bucket of crap contains
Don't waste a minute of your life watching this
Don't even waste your time sending a review
"The Bat People" is a proud resident of the IMDb Bottom 100
Every once and a while the movie suddenly vanishes from the infamous list, depending on whether there are new movies with Paris Hilton in the lead or documentaries about American Idol stars, but it always reliably returns sooner or later
And why? Because, unlike the majority of crap in that list, "The Bat People" is a legitimate bad film and it deserves to be on there regardless of any media influences or internet buzz! This nearly isn't the worst film ever made, since the basic concept definitely has a certain charm and ingenuity, but it's still indescribably difficult to sit through the whole thing
The script is incredibly boring, with absolutely unnecessary padding footage and gigantic gaps in continuity, and yet the main characters still remain total strangers throughout the entire film
Other than a sensible screenplay, the film also lacks spectacular killing sequences and the make-up effects  although courtesy of a young Stan Winston  are ludicrously inept and remain largely unseen until the end of the film
The film's title is inaccurate, as "people" refers to a number in plural whereas the story actually just revolves on one Bat Person
Much more than Bruce Wayne, the real Batman plays in this movie and he as well has a genuine Bat-cave and a Bat-mobile (a stolen ambulance)! The plot introduces a young couple on their honeymoon-weekend exploring caves
They wander off from a guided tour group and he gets bitten by a bat whilst trying to protect his wife from the animal's vicious attack
Worried that he might be infected with rabies, he undergoes an intense treatment at the local hospital, but still this doesn't prevent him from slowly transforming into a bloodthirsty bat creature
He kills random people at night and toys around with the suspicious police sergeant whilst his loving wife is still vastly convinced the awkward behavior is exclusively due to allergic reactions to the rabies treatment
Sure, honey! The script never explains why a bat would attack people and how come John always changes back into a normal human being at the dawn of a new day instead of gradually turning into a permanent state of bat-guano
So basically, "The Bat People" is a variation on the good old werewolf-theme, but obviously not a very interesting one
The concept showed a lot of potential, but somehow the sub plots center on whiny drunks and perverted Sheriffs instead of on ghastly monsters
Some of the settings and exterior filming locations look impressive, the misfit song playing during the credits is strangely catchy, there's a nice bit of gore during the climax (finally!) and main actress Marianne McAndrew is ravishing to look at (though not to listen to)
This truly bad and boring film's current listing in the bottom 100 is spot number 80, and personally I hope it sticks somewhere in that region
The list simply wouldn't feel and traditional without "The Bat People"
When I look for new cars, I expect not to be shown boats
When I drink fountain Coke, I should expect that the drink contains Coke
When I watch a movie that embellishes itself with the name of en excellent scientist, I expect that it is in some way relevant to that person or their work
This could have been people discussing my grannys' diary
The material covered is relevant only in that they vaguely tirade science
I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch it, & the second time I stopped watching it
<br /><br />I love science & documentaries
I would rather watch them over the latest blockbuster
However this falls far short of providing anything worth your time  Avoid at all costs
I almost made a fool of myself when I was going to start this review by saying " This movie reminded me of BILLY ELLIOT " but then I looked up the resume of screenwriter Lee Hall only to find out that he was the guy who wrote BILLY ELLIOT so it's Mr Hall who's making a fool of himself not me <br /><br />Am I being a bit cruel on him ? No because Lee has something most other aspiring screenwriters from Britain don't have - He has his foot in the door , he has previously written a successful British movie that won awards and made money at the box office and what does he do next ? He gives the audience more of the same <br /><br />Young Jimmy Spud lives on some kitchen sink estate
He is bullied at school and no one loves him
The only thing keeping him going is that he has aspirations to be a ballet dancer
No actually he has aspirations to be an angel but considering his household he may as well be a ballet dancer
He has a macho waster of a father who thinks " Ballet dancers are a bunch of poofs while his granddad says " Ballet dancers are as tough as any man you could meet
" Yup Ballet is a main talking point on a run down British council estate those days - NOT
Come to think of it neither is left wing politics which seems to be the sole preserve of middle class do gooders who live in nice big houses , so right away everything about this set up feels ridiculously false <br /><br />Another major criticism is that this is a film that has no clue who it's trying to appeal to
I have often criticised Channel 4 for broadcasting movies at totally inappropriate times ( THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT at 6 am for example ) but they showed this at 2 am and for once they've got it spot on
Considering the story involves politics , ballet dancing ( Gawd I hate it ) lung cancer and poverty there's no way this can be deemed suitable for a family audience but since the main protagonist is an 11 year old child and features angels and ballet dancers ( Don't blame me if I seem obsessed with the subject - there was no need to refer to them ) there's not much here for an intelligent adult audience either
<br /><br />Of course if Lee Hall had been told at the script development stage by the producers that he should write a story featuring a schoolboy and an angel and had flatly refused saying that he wanted to write about other themes and stories then I will apologise but throughout the movie you do get the feeling that once the film was completed it was going to be marketed to the exact same audience who enjoyed BILLY ELLIO
My 7-year-old daughter loved it, as Disney execs crassly calculated that she would
" It's a strictly by-the-numbers children's film filled with carefully calculated cuteness, a couple politically correct morals, and enough potty humor to avoid the dreaded G rating
As a parent, or even as a 10-year-old, you've seen it all before, and done better before
Think "101 Dalmatians Meets Home Alone" and you get the general idea
I'm of the opinion that a good children's story is a good story, period
"Air Buddies," which is about as original as recycled paper, fails to meet that standard
It isn't the worst video your child could watch, but there are megatons of better ones
This movie is so bad that it doesn't even try to hide the fact that it sucks big time
I remember the day I first saw this on MST
then, I saw this product of Rick Sloane which consisted of horrible plush dolls wreaking havoc in the crappy 80s fest land
Kevin, wussy extraordinaire, tries to impress his girlfriend, manages an assistant security guard job, fights with rakes, and plenty more stuff in this very badly made series of images
Obviously no acting is necessary as the film proves
An army guy and his sex crazed girl will make you wanna leap off a cliff, and the dorky friend who gets his kicks off phone sex will make you say, " He has got some nice red shorts"
Plus, I really hated the old security guard and wished he had an accident in his supermarket cart
Just when you think it's over, wait until the Club Scum scene
<br /><br />I advise that after viewing this film, a good month to regain senses and sanity
And if you see Rick Sloane, give him a good kick to the groin to show how much we appreciate this crapsterpiece called Hobgoblins
This ludicrous film offers the standard 1970's "hippie mentality" in a nut shell and bores us in the process
Its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups
A naive young hippy played by the waif-like ( Kay Lenz ) hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day she meets the ridiculous (Holden), already in old age, hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor, and she decides that she is in "love" with him
If you think that is superficial, the whole film encapsulates such scenes
She keeps saying how much she "loves" him and she only met him, it wears thin and really quick
I couldn't help but laugh throughout the film
Its obvious she's just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place
A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex, I had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit
A corny offering of music from the 70's is also spread through the film
Friday the 13th step over! There is officially a worse movie than your hateful series out there
I won this movie in a contest at college, and it was a waste of money even if it was free
Jack Jones stars as a truly awful singer whose trying to find some murderers or something
At least Friday the Thirteenth never bored me
I'd rather have my fingernails pulled than see this again
A terrible amateur movie director (no, not Todd Sheets), his new friend and sister explore a cave
The friend and sister fall in and get rescued
Meanwhile a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their 'turf'
This film and I use the term VERY loosely is so bad that it's
The humor is painfully unfunny, the "action" merely sad
Now I've seen some atrociously awful 'horror' films in my time & failed to grow jaded in my approach to watching low-budget films, yet I still weep openly for anyone who choose to sit through this
ONLY for the most hardened maschocists amongst you
but the rest run away FAST!!<br /><br />My Grade:
Can I please say first of all, that I felt so strongly about this movie that I signed up to IMDb specifically to review it
And my review? This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen
<br /><br />The synopsis of the movie sounded interesting- Nazis, occult, time travel, etc
, but the movies plot failed to properly bring all these elements together
Remember the episode of South Park that featured manatees writing Family Guy using 'idea balls'? Did these manatees also write Unholy? Its like the writer wanted to include all these different ideas, but had no idea how to link them all together, and then to make things make even less sense, included a Donnie Darko-esquire time travel theme to the ending, messing up the chronology
<br /><br />I could tell from early on that this was a bad movie
Special effects were too low budget for anything better than straight to DVD
The acting wasn't great, but in fairness I've seen worse
I will praise the Nazi paintings, they were creepy, but the evil Nazi butcher guy was just comic
<br /><br />I don't have a vendetta against this movie or anything, but to be honest, I'm not even into the horror genre
But this movie cannot be described as a thriller or a drama
If this story had been well told, this would have been a good movie
The main character Lance Barton gets killed and to heaven before his time
When heaven learns about the mistake he is given the body of just deceased rich old and white Mr
<br /><br />A young black guy in a old white mans body still behaving like the young black man is maybe funny if you see it done by an old white actor
In this movie I ended up reminding myself several times: "Chris Rock is supposed to be an old white guy"
<br /><br />The whole concept does not play as intended: The "illusion" is not transported well and the love story is not believable at all
The fact that all you see is Chris Rock playing a young black guy, because the old white person everyone is supposed to see is only shown in small scenes, is to much of a challenge for the viewers "suspension of disbelief"
I can't understand all the hype about this movie
OK, if you like cheap splatter, you will love this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors - don't watch this
Personally i really disliked the actors in this movie, they seem to be hired straight from the street
The Dialogs are completely flat and you always know what's coming up next
The overall quality of this movie lacks of the supposable very low budget
When we saw this movie (me and 3 other people) we all had in mind, that this movie was made by some people who needed to do this, just to get their graduation at a film school - with the lowest effort
Another issue that really lessens the whole experience is the bad cam (very shaking) and the bad sound, the whole movie seems to be recored with a single microphone
And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get the same results
BUT this woman is so darned B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying, and yawn-worthy
She's also totally lacking in anything whatsoever humorous
The deadpan way she tries to deliver her lines is just dead on arrival because she's just not funny
I watched two segments of her program and was ready for Novocaine
<br /><br />Geez, my kid (age 19) saw her promos on Comedy Central and said she was a "dumb chick
The one where she says "Watch my show or I'll kill my dog," is actually believable
She just comes across as a warped nut-case
I just don't ever want to see her around MY dog
In the 60's, having as the background the rehearsal and recording of "Sympathy for the Devil" in the classic album "Beggar's Banquet" by the revolutionary bad boy Rolling Stones  Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman and Brian Jones  plus Marianne Faithful, Godard discloses other contemporary revolutionary and ideological movements  the Black Power through the Black Panthers, the feminism, the communism, the fascism - entwined with the reading of a cheap pulp political novel divided in the chapters: "The Stones Rolling; "Outside Black Novel"; "Sight and Sound"; "All About Eve"; "The Heart of Occident"; "Inside Black Syntax"; and, "Under the Stones the Beach"
<br /><br />"Sympathy for the Devil" is another pretentious and boring mess of the uneven director Jean-Luc Godard
The narrative and the footages are awful, but fortunately I love the Stones and "Sympathy for the Devil" and it is nice to see them in the beginning of their careers; otherwise this documentary would be unbearable
<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Sympathy for the Devil
I saw Arthur(the TV series and the books)years ago and never was fond of the show very much(if you're a fan of this cartoon,sorry if I'm spoiling it for you,but this is actually what I think)
<br /><br />The school kids characters seemed to fought all the time(especially Arther and DW),they were nice to each other frequently,but gradually I got tired of Arthur's complaining attitude towards everyone and his sister DW(however the name was spelled),and DW was an ADHD(or ADD)-like 4-year-old sister of Arthur who was sometimes demanding(which could be why Arthur got annoyed with what her routines were,like her imaginary friend and her stuffed animal collection etc
),Arthur's friends acted like teenagers instead of what they were like in the Arthur books,and the parents,well,they didn't care very much
<br /><br />The greatest cartoon was Rocko's Modern Life,not Arthur(no offense)
I used to be an avid viewer until I personally spent long cold hours helping build a home for the White Family, only to be sickened to see the house a year later
All of the beautiful rock landscaping has been removed, the gorgeous rock sidewalk and front fountain have been removed, all the pine trees and pecan trees in the front have been cut down, sprinkler system has been ripped out
they live "in town" and come out only for the weekend
It sickens me to think of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma donated to these people and to see the result
The story that we all saw on TV wasn't completely the truth
don't believe every thing you see and hear
The exploding zeppelins crashing down upon 'Sky Captain' Jude Law's base present an adequate metaphor to describe how truly terrible this movie is
First off, let me state right off the bat that I sincerely doubt that Paramount will ever recover any money from this film
A cult hit it might become, but only because it is so remarkable for what it failed to achieve
"Let's combine 1920's German Expressionism and a 1940's globetrotting adventure with a modern action flick and use computer animation to dominate every scene! Wow, won't that be a success! " Skycaptain bludgeons the viewer with its sheer excess
There are too many fake explosions, too many unconvincing dogfight scenes, and too few real moments where the characters are anything but painfully two-dimensional
After all, why shock and awe with one floating airship when you can have three, or five, or one hundred?! Moreover, what could have been a groundbreaking film, seamlessly combining computer generated imagery and human actors in a stylized and intriguing setting, will instead become a flop in no small part because it fails to meet the most important requirement of any flick using CGI
Quite simply, the graphics are amazingly poor
From the movement of the cars to the physics of the aircraft in the dogfights, everything seems to be just a little off
An infant could notice that a car doesn't glide along the road like a maglev train (unless its a Mercedes S500)
And for those of you raising your voices in protest, crying out 'This is a stylized film, it's not supposed to be like reality', let me just say this
Lord of the Rings has set the standard for integrating real-life actors with CGI, Starship Troopers has set the standard for ironic science fiction films, the Rocketeer did a solid job reintroducing the decade of the 1920's back into the Hollywood film portfolio, and Tim Burton's Batman created a unique picture of New York City/Gotham that has yet to be repeated
Sky Captain falls so short of all these films, it is hard for me to mention them in the same sentence
Plus, the acting is so poor, it makes me positively ill
I spent $9 to see this film and you get my review
I hope it might dissuade you all from making the same mistake that I did
Six GIs, about to be send home and discharged, get drunk and sneak into a cult meeting in Asia
Surrounded by hooded figures, two male dancers pretend to have a fight
Behind them, on an altar, a woven basket opens and a figure painted emerges and begins imitating a snake, finally biting one of the dancers on the neck
The imitation snake is dressed in some scaley looking body tights
(This is definitely a female imitation snake
) The cult member who has sneaked them into the secret meeting has warned the six men repeatedly that the ceremonies must not be interrupted and, most definitely, no photos must be taken or else they will be hunted down and killed
Naturally, the GIs take a flash photo, send the cult members into an angry hysteria, steal the basket containing the "snake" and run off with it into the Asian night
<br /><br />One of the guys, the most offensive and snarky, dies from a cobra bite on the neck, though no one can explain how the snake got into his hospital room
<br /><br />Back in New York, it all seems rather old news as the discharged men settle down into their civilian lives, still maintaining their bond with one another
Their jobs range from manager of a bowling alley (David Janssen) to graduate research student (Richard Long)
James Dobson, Jack Kelly, and Marshall Thompson are also part of the neighborhood
Richard Long has a nice blond girl friend
But they all get along well enough and all of them seem happy
<br /><br />Then a dark, shifty-looking, mysterious woman (Faith Domergue) shows up and Marshall Thompson takes a liking to her and insinuates her into the group
First Janssen is terrified by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car crash
Something scares him so badly he tumbles through the window and dies in the fall to the sidewalk
Long and Dobson begin to suspect what the viewer already knows -- that Domergue has had something to do with the deaths
They also reckon that maybe she's turning into a cobra, which is the case
Dobson confronts her with his suspicions and she proves his point
<br /><br />By this time Long and Thompson are thoroughly frazzled, particularly Thompson, who is in love with Domergue and has discovered that she is attracted to him, too, although he must explain to her what "love" is
A final reckless attack by the cobra woman against Long's girl friend -- not one of the six original offenders -- and Thompson must throw the snake out the window
On the pavement below, the body changes to that of Domergue
<br /><br />I think I'll skip over most of the questions that the plot raises
I'll just mention one of the more prosaic ones in passing
Who paid for Domergue's fare from somewhere in Asia to New York? Who's paying her utility bills in the hotel? Who paid for her spectacular wardrobe? How come she speaks American English so well? What the hell's going on? The writers and director have clearly seen some of Val Lewton's modest horror films and, though not much effort has gone into this production, they've unashamedly stolen some gimmicks from Lewton
In Lewton's "The Cat People", for instance, the woman is transformed into a black leopard but, with one tiny exception, the threat is always kept in the shadows and is all the more spooky for it
Most of the transformations here use shadows too, but unlike Lewton's, the shadows are clumsy and unambiguous
<br /><br />Lewton also made occasional use of what he called "buses"
A potential victim is hurrying alone through the dark tunnels of Central Park with only the sound of footsteps
She freezes with fright under a street lamp
Something rustles the branches of the shrubs above her
There is a loud, wheezing shriek that makes your hair stand on end
It's a bus using its air brakes to stop for her
The producers used at least two "buses" in this film and they amount to nothing
A guy is walking distractedly across an intersection, for instance, and there is the sudden rumble of a truck that almost hits him
<br /><br />I don't much care for movies that perpetuate the stereotype of serpents as slimy, ugly, venomous, and phallic
As a matter of fact, no snakes are slimy, most are harmless, and many are extraordinarily beautiful
Furthermore, they're more feminine than masculine in their sinuous movements and serpentine approach to goals
You want a reptilian symbol for masculinity? Try a six-lined racerunner
When it sees something to eat, it rushes up and gobbles it down
<br /><br />Anyway, if you want to see some fine, low-budget scary films, don't bother with this one
Find "The Cat People" or one of Lewton's other minor masterpieces, of which this is an obvious copy
Maybe this isn't fair, because I only made it about halfway through the movie
One of the few movies I have actually not been able to watch due to lameness
<br /><br />The acting is terrible, the camera work is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy
For example - during a coke deal, the coke is just kept loose in a briefcase - I'm no expert, but I think people generally put it in a bag
<br /><br />They use the same stupid sound effect whenever a punch is thrown (it's that over the top 'crunching' sound" and they use toy guns with dubbed in sound effects
Shamefull as it may be, this movie actually made it to the videomarket, bringing shame on my proud country - any attempt to watch this movie without stopping or pausing, will be a fruitless attempt
one cannot bear to see more than one hour of this, then having either fallen asleep, or visited the bathroom for puking
<br /><br />Note: if you haven't seen anything else from Denmark, please remember this:<br /><br />some things were never meant to be - but still some idiot goes ahead and makes it anyway
By far the most important requirement for any film following confidence tricksters is that they must, at least occasionally, be able to pull one over on us, as well as their dumb-witted marks, the cops, the mob and (ideally) each other
Every scam can be seen coming a mile off (especially the biggen!) Neither are they very interesting, intricate or sophisticated
Perhaps Mammet hoped to compensate for this with snappy dialogue and complex psychological relationships
The lines are alright, but they're delivered in such a stilted, unnatural, stylised way that I thought perhaps some clever point was being made about us all acting all the time
As for the psychological complexity, the main character's a bit repressed and makes some ridiculously forced freudian slips about her father thinking she's a whore, but she gets over it
Looked just like an Edward Hopper painting
The mind boggles at exactly what about Universal Soldier merited a sequel
Since the real star, Dolph Lundgren, would not be able to reprise his role from the original, there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write-off
Bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler Bill Goldberg and martial arts expert Michael Jai White
To their credit, they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement
Bill Goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film, and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role
For once, his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times, and it does not get irritating
The problem from the audience's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes Lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films
You do not go to see a Van Damme film because you want serious action
You go because you want comedy, however unintentional
<br /><br />Unbeknownst to many people, Universal Soldier was followed by two direct-to-video sequels
I have only seen the first, which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke
Matt Battaglia was so terrible in the role of Luc Deveraux that for once in his career, the sight of Jean-Claude Van Damme comes as a welcome relief
The film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct-to-video sequels, and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original
After years of investigation and explanation, the Unisol project is still going ahead, with some minor modifications
For one, the new Unisols are stronger and more damage-resistant than their earlier cousins
For another, all of the Unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called SETH
In the early parts of the film, SETH exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome
<br /><br />Being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes, we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut
The Unisol project is on the chopping block, which essentially means that SETH will be turned off
SETH, somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained, decides to mobilise the Unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down
His only problem is that every so often, a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown
Two individuals possess the code in question
SETH kills the first in short order, and those who are familiar with the plot kit that Van Damme's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be
The rest of the film revolves around the Unisols' attempts to get the code out of Van Damme without injuring him too badly
A subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film, but it adds about as much to the story as Van Damme does to the profession of acting
<br /><br />The film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichés
When SETH transplants his command module into the body of Michael Jai White, we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over
He goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity's weakness(es)
Gee, SETH, you mean they will not be our strong points? All kidding aside, the short length of the film is both the film's weakness and its strength
It leaves the action without adequate setup
In the original, we are given a very thorough explanation of the Unisols, how they work, and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film
Here, the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a Unisol is and how they operate
At least in the original, a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice
Here, one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform (and presumably his body), getting up every time without stopping for breath
<br /><br />I tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner
If you can see it on the cheap, knock yourself out
This is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of Mystery Science Theatre
At least the music in spinal tap was good
<br /><br />This is really a very sad case of Hollywood nepotism at it's worst
A bunch of Hollywood execs, bad musicians and producers create some "poopie" show so their kids can be in the spotlight
Oh please!!! The potty humor was even bad
I hate this stuff when there is really incredibly talented kids (musicians, actors and artists) out there busting their butts to have success and this crap comes along
<br /><br />Help u all!!!! Why wasn't Gene Simmons in it??? Ameriac's taste in entertainment is going down the toilet
I was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable
I was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up (I wonder if any of them will include this on their CVs?)
The best part of the film is definitely Dani Behr, but the rest of the film is complete and utter PANTS
The Script is bad!!! I guess they've just copy-paste the first 15 pages to 90 pages
The Producers must have thought let's create a Hollywood movie here in Belgium
Now in the third week it is only running in Antwerp and Brussels at 22h45 or something
In the past we have had really good movies in Belgium, like Daens
Maybe you could sneak in the theater after you've seen a real movie
If you've seen 10 minutes of Shades, you've seen it all
It was advertised to death on local radio and TV
I hope it will disappear in the Shades soon
I don't think you can get much worse then this
Put together bad actors, fake limbs, and three stupid stories and what do you get? This B-rate pointless excuse for a movie
<br /><br />The first story immediately shows the bad video quality and the acting is just really pathetic, especially when you bring in the 25 year old posing as a grandma with the usually grandma bun over the ears bit
Plus, the man is OK, but the woman is rather ugly
"You look great!" NOT! The werewolf in this one was the best one out of all three I'd say, but its still not impressive since it was all bad costume
The face on the woman later was decent enough for halloween but not for a werewolf movie
<br /><br />The more stories you go through the worse it gets
There are two lesbians in this next one who are completely retarded its ridiculous
The whole "I want to be a werewolf, too" "How could you do this to me?!" Was silly to say
You asked for it now get over it! The werewolf will not even be spoken of
its a rat!<br /><br />The third one has no point
almost forty five minutes of running and boring narration make up this story and the whole switch thing still didn't make it interesting
who couldn't even hear some parts it was stupid
Animals effects were either rat or pig-like which was stupid
They couldn't use lion sounds? Guess not, GOOD movies use that
Well, i =f you enjoy B-rates this is good for you
I got this movie since I'm a hardcore werewolf fan and i'll buy ANY werewolf movie and watch it more then once, but thats just me
If you prefer Good ones, don't waste your money
I really cant think of anything good to say about this film
the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and doesnt seem to understand the difference
You'd think they would at least get a technical advisor
The performances were bad by most of the cast
Stereotyped, derivative, unoriginal and boring Western
The two popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) both give performances that are far from their best, and justifiably so; they both have superficial roles and character traits stated mainly by dialogue
Heston is a sheriff who "liked the world better as it used to be before" and Coburn is an outlaw who "owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt"
Additionally, Heston is so old that he has trouble riding a horse and Coburn is mean and tough but not as cold-blooded a killer as some of the minor villains
Apparently, the filmmakers couldn't come up with even ONE original idea about how to make this movie somewhat distinguished
I've seen the original non-dubbed German version and I was surprised how bad this movie actually is
Thinking I had seen my share of bad movies like Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake and such, nothing could've prepared me for this! It really was a pain to sit through this flick, as there's no plot, no good acting and even the special effects aren't convincing, especially the so-called zombies, wearing nothing more than white make-up and their old clothes, so their good set wouldn't be ruined by ketchup and marmalade stains
<br /><br />If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, then watch it, for all the others, don't do it, because you WILL regret it
For me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes regarding Franks fanatasies when he is travelling with a staircase and when he is sitting in business meetings
The problem is that when you have been watching this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasies/funny situations again and again and again
It is more done as a TV story where you can go away and come back without missing anything
<br /><br />I like Felix Herngren as Frank but that is not enough even when it is a comedy it has to have more variations and some kind of message to it's audience
It makes sense to me that this film is getting raves from Hollywood because oftentimes in Hollywood it's all just a popularity contest
It also makes sense when you think that people who are liking the film may just be reacting to the countless songs being spit out at you rather than story content
Yet, this film is overrated and overblown
No way do Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles give the Oscar rated performance so many have raved over BEFORE the film was even out
I can't even believe that Condon is being set up to be nominated for a Directing Oscar when all he did was put together an album
Glitz does not replace a nothing storyline
There was not one original idea in this story
Themes were pulled from various sources; a few being The Ninth Gate, In the Mouth of Madness (another Carpenter film), and The Ring
It even went as far as featuring the same damn glowing circle from The Ring and using it as the film's namesake
The soundtrack by Cody Carpenter was all but lifted from Suspiria
Hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word HOMAGE around
Yes, I saw that the theater was playing Argento's Deep Red
Claiming an homage would be a bullshit cop-out
Throwing gore and "disturbing" imagery into the pot does not make a good horror film
He should fade into obscurity or acquire a time machine
Jennifer's Shadow is set in Argentina & starts as Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips) arrives there after her sister Johanna dies
Jennifer is left Johanna's large house in her will, Jennifer decides to sell the house & head back to Los Angeles even though her Grandmother Mary Ellen (Faye Dunaway) is opposed to the sale
However strange things begin to happen, Jennifer starts having nightmares about Ravens pecking at her & she starts to feel very ill
After a check up in hospital it seems that one of her kidney's have mysteriously disappeared, what is happening to Jennifer? Is it an ancient family curse? Will Jennifer be the next to succumb to it
<br /><br />This Argentinian American co-production was co-written & co-directed by Daniel de la Vega & Pablo Parés & is a really dull waste of ninety odd minutes, a tedious & predictable modern ghost story that I would imagine will put more people to sleep sooner than scare them
Pettiette is pretty slow going & tedious which is not what anyone wants, I mean I'm sure most people don't want to sit down & be bored out of their skulls
The character's are all uninteresting & fairly faceless with little or no motivation for anything they do
For instance who is that graveyard caretaker guy? How did he know about the demons? What is his interest & motivation for getting involved? I couldn't see it
Jennifer herself is a pretty unlikable & bland leading lady, her Grandmother Mary Allen is as clichéd as they come & it's surprising that she is so obviously the villain
I mean for this sort of mystery based horror/ghost story it's surprisingly predictable & routine
There are gaps in both logic & the story which together with the terrible twist ending which isn't much of a twist I didn't like Jennifer's Shadow one iota
<br /><br />Directors Vega & Parés goes down the much used route of bleaching almost all of the colour from the picture which often renders it not too far from black and white, I suspect that they wanted to give it a period Gothic feel but it's been done so many times before & often so much better that it didn't do much for me at all & just makes the whole film look dull & lifeless
There's a definite 40's period look as well, from the costumes to the interior of the large house but again it's rather half hearted & cheap looking
Jennifer's Shadow is well made but it's rather forgettable, it's not scary or creepy & it's rather predictable
If that wasn't enough there's no gore either, there's a few scenes of Ravens pecking away at people & a beating heart but nothing else
<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 & retitled to The Chronicles of the Raven for it's US & international DVD release this is reasonably well made but a million won't buy you too much these days & Jennifer's Shadow pretty much proves that theory
There are too many scenes of actor's speaking in thick Argentinian accents as well, even though it might be realistic I actually like to be able to understand what people are saying
The acting is alright although Dunaway overacts badly & is obviously there for the money
<br /><br />Jennifer's Shadow is a rubbishy ghost film that I thought was a total bore from start to finish, I would rather watch The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies!!? (1964) again instead
where do I begin?!?<br /><br />This film gives Manos - The Hands of Fate and Future War a run for their money as the worst film ever made
This one is fun to laugh at, where as Manos was just painful to watch
Hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term: "80's cheeze"
The acting (and I am using this term loosely) is atrocious, the Hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you will ever see, and the garden tool fight has to be seen to be believed
The movie was the perfect vehicle for MST3K, and that version is the only way to watch this mess
This movie gives Mike and the bots lots of ammunition to pull some of the funniest one-liners they have ever done
If you try to watch this without the help of Mike and the bots
Just saw it yesterday in the Sao Paulo Intl Film Festival
Just before going I came here to see how it was rated, and at that time it was 7
<br /><br />After 15 minutes I was dying to get out (never did this), but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screening
<br /><br />I did not like at all, the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere, the characters are shallower than the dialogs, nothing lead anywhere, and the worst and worst: plenty of Siemens and Organics advertising on the movie
Despite the fact that I already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself, I still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and Siemens mobile popping-up all the time on her lap-top; or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have Organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen! All of this would be bearable if the plot, characters, romances, anything was good, but was bad, really bad! A "don't know how to do" sex-in-the-city
<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money
First Stanwyck's son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way, and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way
In an effort to save him, Stanwyck gets unlucky, yet again, and comes across an escaped convict
She has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way
In the end her husband is saved, and Stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is
<br /><br />I could never figure out how an unattractive woman like Stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in Hollywood's glamour-oriented Golden Era; that nose is so beautiful So photogenic The film is mercifully short, running a little over an hour
It's as though the director sensed that he was making crap, so he thought it best to keep the crap short
'I'm working for a sinister corporation doing industrial espionage in the future and I'm starting to get confused about who I really am, sh*#t! I've got a headache and things are going wobbly, oh no here comes another near subliminal fast-cut noisy montage of significant yet cryptic images
'<br /><br />I rented this movie because the few reviews out there have all been favourable
Why? Cypher is a cheap, derivative, dull movie, set in a poorly realised bland futureworld, with wooden leads, and a laughable ending
<br /><br />An eerie sense that something interesting might be about to happen keeps you watching a series of increasingly silly and unconvincing events, before the film makers slap you in the face with an ending that combines the worst of Bond with a Duran Duran video
<br /><br />It's painfully obvious they have eked out the production using Dr Who style improvised special effects in order to include a few good (if a little Babylon 5) CGI set pieces
This sub Fight Club, sub Philip K Dick future noir thriller strives for a much broader scope than its modest budget will allow
<br /><br />Cool blue moodiness served up with po-faced seriousness - disappointingly dumb
This is not intelligent Sci-Fi, this is the plot of a computer game
Insignificant and low-brained (haha!) 80's horror like there are thirteen in a dozen, yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind
The special effects are tacky, the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential paragraphs! "The Brain" takes place in a typical quiet-American town setting, where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the cool-kid in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet
Blake and his adorable pet-brain begin their quest for nation-wide mind controlling
Under the label of "independent thinkers", a giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill! How cool is that? Now, it's up to the Meadowvale teen-rebel to save the world! The funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr
Blake and his monstrous brain actually come from
There are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but that's about it
Meh, who needs a background in a movie like this, really? There's not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the "evil" brain looks like an over-sized sock-puppet
The only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie
Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same men who made "Bloody Birthday" (guilty pleasure of mine) and "Plague"
Both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry
The most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great David Gale, whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in Re-Animator
A girl named Christine Kossak provides the nudity-factor and she's obviously a great talent She has exactly 3 movies on her repertoire of which THIS is her "masterpiece"
In her debut, she was credited as 'runaway model' and in "3 men and a baby", her character is referred to as 'one of Jack's girls'
I really wonder how she feels about her career as an actress
Unfortunately for me, I get the feeling that the more you know about fencing, the worse it gets simply due to the fact that it becomes totally unrealistic
I've been fencing since i was 14 years old, and this movie portrays it very poorly
Murray Abraham is good (and appears to have some fencing background), but most of the other actors--especially the students--just seem to be lost
The only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequel
<br /><br />From start to finish "The Tooth Fairy" was just downright terrible
It seemed like a badly-acted children's movie which got confused, with a "Wizard of Oz" witch melting and happy kiddies ending combined with some bad gore effects and swearing
<br /><br />Half of the cast seem completely unnecessary except for conveniently being there to get murdered in some fashion
The sister of the two brothers, Cherise the aura reader and Mrs
McDonald have entirely no point in the film - they could have included them in the main plot for some interesting side stories but apparently couldn't be bothered
The people watching the film know the characters are there for some bloody death scene but come on, at least TRY and have a slight plot for them
The story in general is weak with erratic behavior from the characters that makes you wish they all get eaten by the witch
<br /><br />Add the weak plot and the weak acting together (the children are particularly wooden) and the movie ends up a complete failure
If only MST3K could have had a go at this one
The acting wasn't great, the story was full of simplistic turns and transparent characters
It's about the repercussions of the struggle between right-wing Flemish block voters on the one side and the Moroccon people living in the Belgian city Antwerp on the other side
Is it a political analysis ? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet ? The film just isn't strong enough to answer both questions (supposing those were the director's questions, too)
Still, some of the scenes could function as a kind of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp
After all, this city has been the starting point of the extremist right-wing Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures
It's very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this one isn't successful, unfortunately
Still, it's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present-day Belgium
The few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise it's not the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that haunt Belgium, a 10 million people country, in the 2000s<br /><br />Dries Van Donge
I do not recommend this movie , because it's inaccurate and misleading, this story was supposed to be in Algerian Berber territory, this one was shot in the southern Tunisian desert, (completetly different culture, I know I am from both Tunisia and Algeria), the other shocking element was the character of her companion aunt, speaks in the movie with a very eloquent french, university level academic french while the character she plays was supposed to be of a disturbed never left her mountain kind of personage, so living as a Bedouin with that kind of education i that context is impossible, The most disgraceful scene and disrespectful especially for the people of the region is the "femme repudiee" segment which is s pure invention from the writer/director, things like that will never happen in a Algerian Society ever!!
This movie proves that good acting comes from good direction and this does not happen in Ask the Dust
Colin Farrell is usually a fine actor but in this he is juvenile
Donald Sutherland comes across as an amateur
Why? Because the script is awful, the adaptation is awful and the actors seem bored and half hearted
The atmosphere of the movie is bad - I could only think when it would finish and I turned it off half way
The director has done a very poor job and even though I have not read the novel it is certainly a missed chance
The atmosphere this film is trying to evoke and the message and storyline never reaches the audience
Lets make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically have everything that happens on the show! Well if that idea doesn't intrigue you, which it shouldn't, stay away from ringmaster
I had the displeasure of seeing this in the theater and actually being able to sit through this mess of a movie
I guess jerry springer doesn't play himself as it shows from the cheap props for his show (yes it looks even cheaper than the real jerry springer show) and he is only known as jerry in the film
The plot (if you can call it that) is about a daughter while living with her mother decides to start sleeping with the mother's live in boyfriend
So the mother's brilliant idea is to call the jerry springer show as well as getting it on with her daughter's boyfriend
(Is it any coincidence they live in a trailer park)
Meanwhile somewhere else in america a woman finds her cheatin' man with her friend in bed together
So of course call america's therapist Jerry springer! I'd talk about the rest of the film but even thinking about the film now is giving me a headache
Jamie Pressly who plays the daughter looks totally unattractive in the movie
And remember Michael Dudikoff the kick ass karate master from the american ninja series? Well take a look at him now as a white trash drunk
The thing is he really looks too horrible and out of shape to call it "getting in touch with his charecter"
But if your idea of fun is seeing Jerry Springer sing a country song about his own show or guys hooking up with transvestites
at least steve was smart enough to stay out of this flick
"True" story of a late monster that appears when an American industrial plant begins polluting the waters
Amusing, though not really good, monster film has lots of people trying to get the monster and find out whats going on but not in a completely involving way
Give it points for giving us a giant monster that they clearly built to scale for some scenes but take some away in that it looks like a non threatening puppy
An amusing exploitation film thats enjoyably silly in the right frame of mind
(My one complaint is that the print used on the Elvira release is so poor that it looks like a well worn video tape copy that was past its prime 20 years ago
I find myself wondering what the people who gave this a 10 saw in it that I didn't
This movie has a VERY hard time following and/or staying to a plot
If someone tells you it's a comedy, don't be fooled, it's about 98% percent odd-drama and 2% comedy
All actors turn in a great performance, that cannot be denied, however it seems like it really lost something somewhere
Don't know if the original script was good and it had to be edited down or what
This had potential, and instead it was really a flop
I would really like the hour and a half I invested in this movie back, but the video rental place doesn't do returns on time
Störtebeker is truly one of the worst TV mini-series ever made on this planet
<br /><br />The acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense: Just two examples: Visby was shown as a village of three houses
Instead, it was a major city at this time, it's best days already passed by
Secondly, Hamburg would have never been the city taking care of pirates in the Baltic Sea
Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea, the major town at that time was Lübeck
<br /><br />But worse than all that: The directing! How can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this? Impossible! There was not a single believable scene it, the fights were ridiculous and I could not suppress laughter at most stern scenes
<br /><br />I can't understand at all how a major television station could be so incompetent
***spoilers***spoilers***spoilers***spoilers<br /><br />There are bad movies and then there are movies which are so awful that they become affectionately comical in their ineptness
Such is the case with Columbia Pictures' 'The Grudge
' This cinematic atrocity began when an otherwise well intentioned American saw a Japanese made for TV film 'Ju-on' and was inspired to remake the movie in English
This began a virtual tsunami of bad decisions which circumnavigated the globe until it washed ashore in Orlando on October 21, 2004
<br /><br />The premise, and I use the word loosely, involves a house in Tokyo haunted by a skinny Momma ghost who looks like a cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette, along with her ghastly sidekick a chubby, rambunctious but evil second grader
Is there anything scarier than a creepy 8 year old Japanese boy? Sure there is! Count Chocula comes to mind
With this whimsical bunch we must add a mysterious black cat who I have affectionately named Chim Chim
(Remember Speed Racer?) As you have already guessed, they were murdered in this domicile of doom and now desire to kill everyone who enters the premises
You see, as explained by a Japanese detective, when someone dies in a rage their ghost seeks revenge on everyone who steps on the property lines as defined by the county commissioner or something like that, I forget
<br /><br />The story begins innocently enough with acclaimed thespian Bill Pullman leaping to his death from a balcony
My guess is Bill Pullman got this job because of his kids begged him for a trip to Tokyo Disneyland
Next we endure the mildly interesting saga of Nurse Yoko, 'oh no don't go in there' screams the audience, but alas she heeds not the dire warnings and is predictably snuffed out like a magic lantern
About 30 minutes into the movie we finally see its American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen
Sarah Michelle Gellar might be a competent actress but I could not help thinking of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so much so that it was distracting
It is the equivalent to having Jennifer Anniston star in a movie about the adventures of six friends in New York
Try as you may, you just can't stop thinking about the other project which made her famous
But I digress, Karen, the nurse is hired as a replacement for the original care giver who disappeared at spooks r us
<br /><br />She snoops around, meets the ghosts, coma lady dies, and some other stuff happens
Watching the fair haired vixen searching for clues I half expected her to find the ghost and pull its mask off to reveal it was actually old man Gower who owned the abandoned amusement park! 'I would've gotten away with it too if it weren't for you meddling kids and that dog of yours!' <br /><br />Director Takashi Shimizu, who is vying to be the Ed Wood of Asia, made two unfortunate decisions involving sound
First, he choose to use a soundtrack only when someone is about to be killed
This is an excellent devise for obliterating any suspense because the audience gets a two minute warning to prepare for another miserably predictable murder
Second, he gave the ghosts a bizarre guttural noise that sounds like a gargling gopher
After the movie, I heard several people exiting the theatre making the sound and laughing
<br /><br />Sarah Michelle Gellar ends up being the sole survivor
And of course we learn that the fire she set to burn down the house was extinguished in time for the obligatory next chapter
However, considering the humorous reactions of the audience, they did not want a sequel but an apology
'The Grudge' could be easily re-edited into a comedy, perhaps then it will be appreciated for its camp value
Baring that, this will go down as the greatest cinematic thriller since 'Godzilla vs
' I would suggest waiting until the movie comes to your local discount theatre where it can receive the public ridicule it so richly deserves
Considering its pedigree, this should be a far more enjoyable film than it is
Even with a lip-smacking collection of eccentrics in the cast - what aficionado would not eagerly anticipate a movie which brings together Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - the entire event is dully paced, drearily shot and, more often than not, witless
<br /><br />Kim Novak's gifts were not essentially comic, as she went on to confirm in Kiss Me Stupid
James Stewart was a fine comedian, as he ably demonstrated in movies from ranging from The Philadelphia Story to Harvey
I think he comes out better from this mess than anyone else does
An OK flick, set in Mexico, about a hit-man (Scott Glenn) who hitches a ride with struggling American writer and his Mexican girlfriend after a hit
He pays them to take him to the border  but things get out of hand
<br /><br />It starts well enough, but quickly struggles and dies
<br /><br />**SPOILER**<br /><br />The eventual relationship twist is badly set up and difficult to believe
An absence of passion, and essentially no reasoning behind her leaving one man for the other, made it ridiculous - and the ending was predictable and dull
<br /><br />**END SPOILER**<br /><br />Harvey Keitel is the US agent on the hit-man's trail, but he seems a little confused as to how boring and slow the script is
Yet another example of the complete waste of UK Lottery money
The Film Council ,who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded, on one of the London Undergrounds disused stations, for allowing this clichéd, dismal specimen to be committed to film, a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate, most notably Deathline
Amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute
It's a little bit too late then! Surely all those development executives, at the UK Film Council, could have noticed this at the script stage
Add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare
I had suspicions the movie was going to be bad
I really wanted to see the General jump again and some of the chase jump scenes were good
But to sum it up, the movie was a dumbed down tarted up version of the TV show
While I can honestly say that the original Daisy's outfits were just as revealing, Jessica Simpson's interpretation of Daisy was simply awful
Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle must be rolling in their graves as well
If you are an old tried and true Dukes fan like me and my three kids are you will be very disappointed
SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER is another example of what happens when you get a bunch of untalented people together to make an "extreme" horror film
Any sort of acting, production, storyline, FX, etc
go out the window in an effort to create "shock-value"
Now don't get me wrong - I consider myself a connoisseur of "shock" films, and the sleazier/gorier/nastier the better - but it's still nice to see SOME sort of talent from SOMEONE involved in the film
<br /><br />SCHIZOPHRENIAC chronicles the life of Harry Russo - a drug-addicted freak-show who takes orders to kill from his ventriloquist's dummy, Rubberneck
He goes on a few sprees killing hookers and other random people, and screaming about how much he hates "hoo-uhs" (that's "whores" for those of you that don't speak New York-ese
) and how he wants to rape them in the ass
There are a few weak necrophilia scenes, very little gore, and some nudity to mix things up a bit - but nothing that you haven't seen in a better film
<br /><br />The only redeeming thing that I can find in this retarded film are the often (unintentionally?) hilarious screaming-fits from our main man, Harry
He goes on-and-on-and-on about wanting to kill everyone and do them in the ass, and it really becomes quite comical after a while
In fact, I'm almost tempted to believe that there's supposed to be some sort of homo-erotic undertone to this film, with all the ass talk and constant shots of Harry running around with his dong hangin' out
In all honesty, that joker is nekkid more in this film then the few chicks that show some T-and-A (and some full-frontal, for good measure)
SCHIZOPHRENIAC is mildly amusing as a 1-time watch, but I can really only recommend this to those that want to be able to say that they watched a film called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER
To be honest - the title, by far - is the best thing about this trash
Just Cause is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily slated when it came out - nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from Ed Harris
Then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until you've got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet Sean Connery's wife (a typically mannered and unconvincing Kate Capshaw) and kid (a very young Scarlet Johannsen) in an alligator skinner's shack
<br /><br />The kind of movie that's probably best seen on a plane, and even then only once
This is not going to help the Australian film industry to make this kind of film with no values of any kind
Okay, if you're a stoner and have nothing better to do, then maybe
I think film-makers from here should try to show the rest of the world what great talented people we have, and this is not the vehicle for it
It was everything this isn't: it had pace, pop, and actors who weren't afraid to chew the scenery
If Farrah isn't really "serious" about a career, why does she have a manager (and why is he wasting his time)? If Kate and Barney are "artists," why do they sign up for The Mother of All Jiggle Shows (like the "Brady Bunch" movie where Robert Reed wants to do Shakespeare, only to find himself on BB)? They weren't industry names, but they weren't exactly starving, either
And while they got the history right (the poster was released before Farrah got the show), Silverman rejecting pitches for "Funniest Home Videos" and "American Idol" and Spelling promising his baby girl Tori someday he'll create a show for her obviously did not happen
<br /><br />What bothered me was how Spelling's role is distorted
He's shown as the show-runner and creator when he was neither
And how he "comes up" with the "idea" for CA was is laughable!<br /><br />How were Spelling and Goldberg allowed to enforce Farrah's oral contract when the others were signed? And why didn't Farrah or Bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her Inner Diva, but because Majors wanted her to? This is why, when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting Farrah up as the "bad girl" (like Suzanne Somers), it fails because the groundwork was never laid -- that was where the "Three's Company" pic delivered
Some wonder why there weren't anymore Mrs
Will it's because this movie totally blew snot
Disney was not the right studio to run this film
MAYBE Touchstone (well, they're owned by Disney, but it'd be more adult)
The film is too kid-ish, as the book series is not
The casting is all wrong for the characters
The characters don't even act the way they do in the books
And why was Tucker changed to a guy? He's a girl in the frigging books! Was this done to make the film appeal to boys? Sheesh
And where was Pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth
Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but letting Disney blow her work was wrong
An animated feature film, perhaps in the vane of Don Bluth's artwork would suit a better Mrs
Overall, I give this a 2, because at least Disney made a film from an under-appreciated book series
Either way, I still have my books to entertain me
The tragedy is that this piece of rubbish was part of my curriculum while I was studying cinema
So imagine how I was forced to watch it in complete
Believe me going through hell is much much easier
Our professor told us that this is some film ???, but he never thought that we'd disagree or assume the apposite
I don't think that there is any gods on earth, we're only humans, so all the filmmakers, therefore they CAN make mistakes, bad movies
The main problem wasn't that art, by all means, is susceptible to endless points of view, but that a lot of people just don't get it, that every single human got his own genuine taste, his own opinion, hence what I suppose it the greatest movie ever made, can also be your worst one ever, and how that is right both ways, but how many people can understand this correctly?
So my professor believes in this movie, and simply I don't
However, the only way to evaluate this "thing" is by measuring it by its original intent to show us different kinds of old folk stories or whatever to catch on this society's mentality, imagination, and nature
Pier Paolo Pasolini as the scriptwriter and the director made it too unbearable to watch in the first place
I can't stand this, so how about analyzing it, then discovering the potential beauty in it !! It's beyond your mind hideousness, and strangely not for the sake of the movie's case or anything, it's for the sake of the unstable vision of (Pasolini)
His work is so primitive to underdeveloped extent
The deadly cinematic technique, the effective sense of silliness, and the incredible horribleness made everything obnoxious
Look at the atrocious acting, the unfruitful cinematography, the awfully poor sets,
It can terminate your objectivity violently as watching this movie is one true pain like taking the wisdom tooth off by a blind doctor
There are dreadful nightmares which could be more merciful than this
So originally, how to continue THAT just to review it fairly ? Actually, you don't
As this very movie doesn't treat you fair at all
There is really memorable scene in here where some boys are peeing into the eye of the camera (!) I'm trying to connect some things like that with Pasolini's end as murdered
A splendid example of how Hollywood could (and still can) take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up
<br /><br />In the case of "the Big Sky," writer Dudley Nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the Pulitzer prize-winning author, A
In so doing, they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation
<br /><br />The epic nature of Guthrie's book and the evolution of its main character, Boone Caudill, from a naive, Kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivor/mountain man, has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the author's intent
In the movie version, Boone's presence is nothing except underwhelming
<br /><br />Intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give Guthrie's novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever
Most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the Zeb Calloway character, who was an incidental, minor character in the book, only occupying a handful of pages
On the other hand, a very important and fascinating character, Dick Summers, the veteran pioneer, is missing altogether!!! It is also apparent that director Hawks decided the Zeb character in the movie, played by actor Hunnicutt, wasn't irritating enough
So Zeb/Hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious, voice-over narration that is the Hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing, editing, and direction
<br /><br />Some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based (William Wyler's "Ben-Hur" is an excellent example)
But this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself
<br /><br />The story is dull and clichéd, and the characters - at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script - are just shallow and boring shadows of Guthrie's literary vision
And unfortunately, Kirk Douglas' star appeal, which could have helped lift this film, was scuttled by the milktoast role he was given
<br /><br />If you can believe it, the film version of Guthrie's Pulitzer prize-winning sequel, "The Way West," also starring Kirk, is even worse
<br /><br />In my opinion, "The Big Sky" further solidifies Howard Hawks' place as one of the most overrated, tepid directors in the history of cinema
Robert DeNiro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time
This movie is so wasteful of talent, it is truly disgusting
Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of herself, and not a funny one
The movie moves at a snail's pace, is photographed in an ill-advised manner, and is insufferably preachy
It also plugs in every cliche in the book
Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supporting role, but so what?<br /><br />Equally annoying is this new IMDB rule of requiring ten lines for every review
When a movie is this worthless, it doesn't require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape
This movie is so bad that I cannot even begin to describe it
What in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers, producers and director? How on earth did they get funding for this abomination? The plot is laughable, the acting is poor at best, the story
What story? The first fight in this movie is OK but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it off
<br /><br />I guess I'm the biggest looser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minute
<br /><br />*** SPOLER ALERT ***<br /><br />I only saw this movie because Scott Adkins was in it
<br /><br />I give it 1 out of 10 because it's the lowest grade IMDb has to offer
<br /><br />Do yourself a favour: See an Uwe Boll movie instead
A fashion designer trips over a cat and falls into a pool, hitting her head on something floating on the surface
With rather cheesy effects (this was a TV movie) she floats up out of her body
She floats through a tunnel of rings of swirling orange smoke, and black rigid figures tip into her view (they look like the mannequins in her apartment)
I almost thought I was watching a Jess Franco movie
As her friends revive her, a black arm grabs her by the wrist, and she has to struggle to get loose
When she is revived, she remembers everything, and has a nasty bruise on her forearm
<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, she nearly gets hit by an out-of-control car that comes up on the sidewalk behind her
On Halloween, she decides with her boyfriend to go to Mexico for a vacation
When she gets there, she's surprised to find it's the Day of the Dead
They're annoyed by another American tourist who keeps following them, and he almost drowns them
<br /><br />The designer is encouraged to join a group of people who've had near death experiences
They've all experienced the tunnel, but not the black figures or the repeated near escapes from death
She's also encouraged to meet with a psychic
<br /><br />A Doctor tells her about people he calls "Walkers" (the name of the novel this was based on)
They're people who supposedly died of one cause that, when examined, prove to have died of another cause
Thus it's like they continued walking around after dying until they died again, but he blames it on poor record-keeping
<br /><br />I watched this on the 102 minute video, and it felt awfully long
I can't imagine that there's actually a 192 minute version! Perhaps if it was meant to be watched over two or more nights on TV it would better be watched that way than in one sitting
<br /><br />I've only read one Gary Brandner novel, Floater, and if it is representative of his work, he's not the most original of writers
Floater had the common plot of: picked on kid kills people in revenge
Even the variation was pretty common: picked on kid dies and kills people years later in revenge from beyond the grave
And in fact it has a point in common with this movie, in that the kid practices astral projection, and when he is drowned he floats up out of his body as here
I don't know how closely From the Dead of Night follows his novel Walkers
I understand the Howling movies don't bear much resemblance to his novels
<br /><br />It's quite a slow movie, and the special effects and cinematography are really held down by the (presumably) low budget and made-for-TV shortcomings
There are a lot of easily recognizable character actors in it
It also feels very dated, more early to mid 1980s than 1989
A much better low-budget movie covering similar subject matter that I don't think has dated as badly is Sole Survivor (1983) (arguably the inspiration for the 2000s Final Destination movies)
The comment by "eliz7212-1" hits the proverbial "nail on the head" for this turkey of a program
But it is a hoot to watch William Shatner "cavort" and "dance" (yes, the " " marks on the word dance are necessary for what Bill does)
This show would be a great skit on SNL or MAD TV - and it does rate a few stars for one viewing, or so, to see Shatner, who seems to have taken "camp" to new heights - whether in a role or as himself
<br /><br />The girls who are in the cubicle areas with the game data scrolls, will be pretty much out-of-luck when this turkey is canceled - unless there is a revival of the whiskey-a-go-go genre, with a resurrected demand for shapely young women to dance in elevated cages once more
<br /><br />I watched the first contestant, who was annoying, and literally "dumber than a :post," yet through sheer luck, walked away with a quarter mil or so
The second contestant, somewhat more intelligent, but who'd be lucky to gain $1,000 on Jeopardy!, got zonked by the card which requires answering a special question - which he didn't know, and thereby left with zilch
<br /><br />This plethora of game shows, which dangle, and sometimes award, large sums to everyday individuals, are admittedly a cheap effort, overall, to attempt to woo viewers
Even if the host is well-compensated, and they give away six figures in an average episode, I suppose that the revenue versus costs can be favorable - since you don't have a sitcom cast where several stars are getting six or seven figures, per episode, with some big residual deals as well
<br /><br />But I suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long
This one has already pretty much reached this point
I think his offerings, especially with James Spader, and the others on "Boston Legal" should give us a satisfying quantity of Bill Shatner's offerings
<br /><br />Again, the above rating is simply appropriate to view Bill hoot and prance, perhaps one time; that should be sufficient
This is even worse than the original Game of Death
A jumbled, incoherent storyline leads to "Billy Lo" falling from a helicopter to the ground below, killing him, as we're left to follow his younger brother, Bobby Lo
So not only do we start out following some Bruce Lee clone, the film kills that one off and has us follow another one thirty minutes into the story
The main reason to watch this one is when Bobby Lo fights a lion, which is quite obviously a guy in a lion costume
Jang Lee Hwang is also the villain, who is usually pretty awesome but his screen time is significantly small
Mainly watched this and the original Game of Death because they're a part of the Bruce Lee boxed set
It's no wonder they're included with Lee's finished works
I wish I had my rental money back from this piece of trash so I could donate it to the Home for Aged Actors
Total rubbish!! Five people watched this movie at the same time and there wasn't one single laugh to be heard, lots of yawning though
Paltrow's a beautiful woman and she was the best thing to look at in the entire so-called comedic movie
for one,i just found it crude and vulgar,for no reason
i also felt it's misogynistic(against women
)also,the movie really doesn't appear to be about anything,and i didn't find any of the characters likable
really,the there doesn't seem to be any point to it all
maybe i'm missing something,but for me,this movie is pretty much a waste of time,when i could have been doing something more productive and enjoyable
Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones,and James Cromwell
all are wasted here,and i'm sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers
Jennilee Harrison(from the later years of Three's Company)is also in the movie,and it is nice to see her in a non ditsy role
but other than that,she can't rise above the mediocre script
Interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event, even though he did save many other captive children
The film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen patrolling the hallways, bathrooms and even class rooms
In other words, the High School is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal
Dolph Lundgren,(Sam Decker) plays the soldier/school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field
However, the principal asks him to have a Detention Class as his last duty as a teacher
It is at this point in the film when all Hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete BOMB
Try to enjoy it, if you decided to View IT
Well, what can you say about a Barbara Cartland adaptation?<br /><br />There are some amazing actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer) but they clearly are clocking up the money
<br /><br />Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland epics - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks suitably embarrassed) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter
<br /><br />If you really want to see a "watchable" adaptation of Cartland, the Bonham Carter one is the one to go for ("A Hazard of Hearts" - what a title!!)
Gilbert is the weak link in that, but Bonham Carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act, and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg
This is another one of those 'humans vs insects/eco-horror' features; a theme that was popular in the late 70's
There's zero suspense and no gruesome events
In other words: this movie is pretty lame
It's not that it's really bad or something; it's just very boring
A construction site near a hotel uncovers a big nest of ants
Later on we learn that, probably due to different sorts of pesticides used in the past, their bite became poisonous
Some people get bitten and rushed to the hospital and it takes ages for the residents of the hospital to figure out what's going on
Robert Foxworth figures it out first and then you can see him go berserk with a digging machine for what seems like several hours
Then they flee in the house, waiting to get rescued
And, man, you should see all the efforts they make for rescuing them
I won't spoil too much, but at one point they even use a big helicopter
All the time when I was watching this, I sat there thinking "Come on, people, you all got shoes on
I'm sure a bunch of ants won't catch up with you
<br /><br />Of course, lots of close-ups of crawling ants are shown throughout the whole movie
And the best part: Ants crawling on people's faces while the actors are breathing through straws
But when you see groups of ants in wider shots, they indeed look like black rice the set designers glued to the wall
<br /><br />One small surprise came near the end
No, it has nothing to do with a twist in the plot
It was just that Brian Dennehy made an appearance as a chief-fireman
What more can I say? This movie is called IT HAPPENED AT LAKEWOOD MANOR but the box-art of my copy read ANTS and the title during the opening credits was PANIC AT LAKEWOOD MANOR
Now, since this is a made-for-TV movie from the 70's, I'll be once again extremely mild in my final rating
Now, THE SAVAGE BEES, another 'humans vs insects' TV-movie from 1976 was much better than this one
I even feel I have to go back and add a few points to its rating after having seen ANTS
Lacking suspense, action, thrills, shocks and creepiness, the only thing you'll be left with after seeing ANTS is an annoying itch
how many minutes does it take to paint a poem? in this film much too long
<br /><br />it tells the story about the impact of a first love between two schoolboys
<br /><br />the boys can't withhold touching each other and making love
after a while one gets distracted by a brief encounter with a sensual guy in the disco and that raises doubt: exploration, fantasy, longing, lust and feelings of loosing grip on your love are themes that are all extensively painted with music, close-ups and silent scenes like telling a poem
but it really takes too long, annoying long, shame, the effort was promisin
Margret Laurence probably didn't intend on having any of her novels adopted for film, let alone the Stone Angel
Hagar, as a character, was one who constantly challenged the social norm (Gainsay who dare, anyone?), and ended up nearly sacrificing her humanity in the process
The symbols in the book (the Stone Angel, Silver Thread, etc, etc
) are constant reminders of this struggle of the old and new, and the carnage (so to speak) along the way
<br /><br />While the film is reasonably faithful to the plot of the book (but it isn't really a plot kind-of storytelling, is it?), I think it missed the point on capturing the spirit of the film
Hagar's defiance (for the sake of defiance) was not there
Bram could have been a lot more crude than portrayed, and Hagar's father could have been played more "traditionally", so to speak
If the filmmaker would insisted on stronger portrayals, the film would drive the point straight to home
<br /><br />Along the same vein, why should we see cell phones, organic produce, and other modernizations? Are we trying make some points for the sake of making some points (e
, the Muslim girlfriend and the Native people)
are everything but politically correct in the book, so why should we see that in the film version
Modernization may be an excuse for a low-budget operation, but using that as an excuse to send subliminal politically-correct messages that are totally irrelevant to the novel (and the film) seems like throwing punches below the intellect
It seems that we have been conditioned to see bitter old people as cute and lovable
Why should be laugh every time Hagar is at her tantrums? I doubt Magaret Laurence wanted her readers to laugh at, or with, Hagar
These people are frustrated and are full of angst, and all we do is to laugh at them
I don't think it did Hagar and other folks in her situation any justice
I bought this movie last weekend at my local Movie Gallery
It was buy 2 get 2 free and I needed one more so I chose this one
The box reads like it would be a really good movie
Well, it starts out like it is going to be this great movie
The movie is about a young woman, Laila, who gets killed trying to save her beau, Jack, from a bull
Laila's dad, Cordobes, is a rancher that the townspeople are afraid of
He assumes that Jack killed Laila because she was supposedly afraid of this bull, and goes on this hunt to find him
That was the first 5 minutes that is good
What follows after that is only gonna get 100 times worse
Whoever wrote the script, in my opinion, had to of been on some kind acid trip or something because nothing else made any sense what so ever
Jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio DJ named Mary who gives him a ride
I think Mary is supposed to be a virgin Mary type character
But, who knows, I couldn't make heads or tails of it
we get to see bad guys, magical visions, ghostly encounters, flashbacks, etc
And all these things are done in such a way that your brain hurts from trying to figure out what's going on
Needless to say, I took the movie back and exchanged it for something else
And, there is absolutely no bull-fighting in this movie
Unless you count the first minute of the movie
Hope I helped some other people keep from wasting their time on this movie
The dudes at MST3K should see this dog of a film
It's basically about a dopey hack actor in Hollywood who can't land any acting gigs
And he has this strange obsession with the movie Taxi Driver
So what does this dumb actor do? He dyes his hair blonde and starts acting like a L
surfer dude in the naive hope this will get him acting roles
You'll laugh yer head off at so many of this movie's inadvertently funny scenes
Like when the actor dude's girlfriend is heart broken and sobbing and saying lines like, "How could you do this to me?" And why is she crying? Cos he dyed his hair blonde and became a surfer dude to get acting gigs
This movie makes no sense at ALL! The actor who played the governor on Benson is in this too and he plays a stereotypical right wing politician with lotsa dumb funny dialog
Julia Roberts obviously makes a concerted effort to shake off her cotton wool Pretty Woman persona with this spurious spousal abuse thriller, but it's hard to imagine she'd end up putting in a performance as powerful and convincing (and oscar winning) as she did in Erin Brokovich based on the back of this rubbish
And make no bones about it, it's nothing more than a Julia Roberts vehicle, but unfortunately, her performance is not the most lacklustre thing about it
<br /><br />The plot has all the markings of a late night made-for-cable, and don't be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because non of the characters are sketched out enough for you to really care
<br /><br />Ultimately disappointing and unsatisfying, without Roberts' name above the title, I'm sure it would have totally flopped, deservedly
Rick Moranis stars in this awful third sequel to the once-funny-and-entertaining "Honey I Shrunk the Kids"
The concept basically plays the same way as the first film, but with the adults instead of the kids being shrunk and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to explore
If you think this sounds interesting, think again
The movie is boring at best, right down an embarrassment at worst
<br /><br />First of all, the continuity of the series has been completely flushed down the toilet
The only remaining actor of the first movie is apparently Rick Moranis
The actress playing his wife has changed, the actors playing the kids have changed, the ones playing the neighbors have changed
They try to make us believe this is the same family, but the results are puzzling to say the least
<br /><br />Second, the story is a rehash of the first one, with not one bit of originality
All the few jokes (and there's barely any) and the dangerous situations presented in the movie are just copied straight from "Honey I Shrunk the Kids"
<br /><br />Third problem, the special effects
I'm sure this has been done on a smaller budget, but they are pathetic, way way worse than the ones appearing in the rest of the series
You're supposed to admire in awe these tiny figures exploring the huge domestic area, but you'll probably end up cringing most of the time
<br /><br />Fourth problem, to locate the action inside the house is just boring
Only few things happen, and when they happen, they are not thrilling at all
The first movie was amusing because the kids were dealing with nature, the grass, and the bugs that live in it
In this one, the adults (which come up as rather boring, compared to the kids) deal with dust, a cockroach and a cockroach trap
<br /><br />I don't know why the idea of releasing such a trite sequel to the already moribund series appealed Disney's executives, except maybe because they needed to cash in without spending five minutes thinking about something new
I'm warning you: leave this tasteless cash-in garbage where it should stay: getting dust on the shop's shelves
Having been pleasantly surprised by Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality, I decided to give Murder By Numbers a shot
While decent in plucky, self-effacing roles, Ms
Bullock's performance in "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed 2, 28 Days) leave much to be desired
Her character is at the same time omniscient, confused, and sexually maladjusted (the sub-plot of Sandra's past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character)
The two teenage boys gave decent performances, although their forensics expertise and catch-me-if-can attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream "We did it!" Chris Penn as the all-too-obvious suspect is wasted here, as is Ben Chaplin's token partner/love interest character
<br /><br />***Spoilers Ahead*** Mediocre acting aside, the biggest flaws can be traced to a TV-of-the-week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place, and as mentioned, the stupid errors (vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene, an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor, the two boys hanging out together in public, a convenient love interest to cause friction, etc
etc) cause the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers
The ending was strictly "By the Numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie
Using the now-cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film, and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment, the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so-called intelligence the film purported to arrive at it's conclusion
A somewhat promising concept, but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way
What happens to those around you when you make a seemingly innocuous decision? Most people don't give it a thought as they absorbed in their own thoughts and actions
<br /><br />"Happenstance" tells the story of the interrelations and cause-and-effect of the mundane as it pertains to a group of normal Parisian folk
It has all the components of what passes for contemporary theater, with the full cast of the dysfunctional and disillusioned
<br /><br />There's a cheating husband, an illegal immigrant, a classic slacker, a pickpocket, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girlfriend, a selfish roommate, and a homeless man
Audrey Tautou serves as the erstwhile protagonist (in the sense that she's on camera as much as anyone else and opens and closes the film) and normal girl who just can't seem to find the right rhythm in her life
<br /><br />She learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger on a train what her horoscope holds for her
What happens to her in the course of the day is told through various characters
Does the prediction come true? The concept is good, but the storytelling is flimsy
The connections from one event to the next are weak
There's better storytelling in 15 seconds of the Liberty Mutual insurance commercial where one person sees a good deed and passes it along to another than there is in two hours of Happenstance
<br /><br />If you enjoy Audrey Tautou, then you certainly can sacrifice the time for this film, but you'll finish it dissatisfied and wondering what this same storyline could be if it were handled by a better producer and director
"I Love New York" is another entry by VH-1 (MTV Networks) showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill, obnoxious, woman
It must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest, Ebonics speaking, craziest contestant - and her mother - and give them a show on this network
True, it's not as bad as it's previous show, "Flavor of Love" - but it's just as bad
<br /><br />It reminds me of a skit from the 90's show "In Living Color" where Keenan Ivory Wayans was imitating the boxer Mike Tyson on "The Love Connection" dating show and he picked "Robin Givens" for a date
Mike talked of how the date was okay, but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in
<br /><br />The men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more - (I would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would NOT allow her - and her mother - to give you a name that is so ghetto, you'll embarrass yourself every time you appear on TV
) but these are professional reality actors, so why bother
<br /><br />It escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this
The fact that this is as fake as her newly implanted additions? 15 Minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network? (Well, you can't hate them for trying to make a buck
) Maybe the wonder is - who would want to be with this woman past an hour? Or wonder if she and her mother's next show would be on the WWF! Any way you slice it, it's a train wreck you've seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to nil
<br /><br />No twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck, or any different from any of the others
Appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those calling an "end" to reality shows, this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end, immediately
It seems to me that Stephen King's "Bachman" pen-name was a way for him to put out some of the grimmer, rawer, more mean-spirited stuff that he wanted to write without 'contaminating' his 'brand name'
If you look back at the "Bachman Books" (Running Man, The Long Walk, Roadwork, Thinner) you notice they have a sealed-in feeling of airlessness and hopelessness about them that is distinct from mainstream King
I realize that we are talking about the guy whose first novel featured a humiliated, blood-covered, emotionally crippled teenage girl slaughtering everyone at her high school prom
but mainstream King always at have characters and plot elements that leaven the grimness of the proceedings a bit, and mostly have endings that offer at least a glimpse of hope and human feeling
Bachman books are just plain mean and always end badly
(BTW, "Pet Semetary" could have easily been a Bachman book if King hadn't revealed the alias by then
And "The Dark Half" seems to be at least partially about his "Bachman" persona
)<br /><br />"Thinner" was the last Bachman book, and man, with its themes of class warfare, revenge, and death by starvation, it is nasty
So it should be no surprise that the movie follows suit
<br /><br />What is a surprise is that the adaptation seems to be filmed at a "TV Movie Of the Week" level of talent instead of something worthy of a theatrical release
(These days, something like this would probably go directly to DVD or cable)
The makeup work and the striking motif (starving to death in the midst of plenty, a metaphor for the overfed, undernourished American middle class if there ever was one) is all that keeps you watching this misfire
<br /><br />What went wrong? My first thought is that the director was going for the nasty Bachman vibe, but he also somehow sucked all the interest out of the movie with poor casting choices - the actors here (with the exception of Joe Monetegna) simply can't carry the movie
And then he squished the warmth and life out of the rest of the movie with awkward pacing and scene structure
Plus he couldn't leave the plot alone, and his changes don't really help
The script and dialog ought to work, but mostly the movie just lies there
Everything is muffled, dull, airless, and no fun to watch
with the vivid exception of the spectacle of the main character getting
<br /><br />As other have pointed out, "Thinner" is by no means the worst King movie ever made (or even the second worst)
And it does have a dreadful, compelling fascination owing to the theme and the careful makeup work
But first time viewers should approach this one with lowered expectations
Routine suspense yarn about a sociopath (Dillon) who gives his sperm to a clinic of human reproduction and starts to harrass the lives of the woman (Antony) and his husband (Mancuso)
Extremely predictable, far-fetched and with undecided tone all the way
First of all, I too was expecting another Hero--a fantastic work of art for the action genre
I've only seen parts of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I can imagine that it is better than HoFD
<br /><br />Basic elements from Hero are found in HoFD: Great landscapes, mesmerizing cinematography, and sincere acting (I mean, if you can't understand a word they are saying, without the subtitles, but you still care--that's good acting)<br /><br />What went wrong? What begins with political intrigue wanders into a love story
Worse, it's a soap opera-like love triangle
You have three characters who, I guess, fall in love with each other- for no good reasons
This movie basically falls apart after the escape from the jail (I fell asleep about forty minutes into it)
It's almost as if they changed writers at that point
The remainder of the movie is about how a character is "like the wind
Also, you really have to stretch your suspension of disbelief to believe the action set pieces
This isn't unique to this genre, but since the story is weak, you can't wait for the action, and then, when the fighting does breaks out, it really wasn't that good
The beginning grabs you, but then this movie just runs out of gas
It began with some promise, then became unfocused and > wandered
John Cusack's Cajun accent was laughable, Bridget Fonda's role > existed only to get a skirt into the film, and Pacino did Pacino
His entire > generation of actors -- Nicholson, Hackman, Caine, Hoffman -- have developed > a standard performance that each can deliver effortlessly (or, less > charitably, "mail in") in their paycheck films
When I first heard about "Down To Earth," I was pretty excited
I'm a pretty big fan a Chris Rock, he was especially hilarious in Dogma
But this film proved to be a disappointment
Chris Rock's performance was not nearly as good as his past performances, and the movie was just very badly directed as a whole
He plays the entire movie as a standup comedy routine
Obviously, this works fine in the scenes where he's supposed to be doing standup, but in the rest of the movie, it doesn't
Even when he's talking to one other character, he seems to think he's trying to make a roomful of people laugh
He has a few funny moments, but they mostly come during the standup scenes (no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian)
As for the rest of the cast, they're pretty much there just to give Rock someone to talk to, none of them stand out
<br /><br />Also, the movie was poorly directed
The movie has basically a one-joke plot: old white guy acting like a young black comedian
While I prefer movies with more than one joke, this still could have worked, and been quite funny
The problem was, we saw too much of Rock and not enough of the old white guy
It's supposed to be funny because it's this white guy telling Chris Rock's jokes, but for most of the time, we just see Chris Rock, so it's not nearly as funny
The few scenes where they decide to show us the white guy talking like Rock are, in fact, hilarious
If he had been shown more, the movie would have been a lot funnier
<br /><br />Overall, a few moments of laughter can't make up for the fact that "Down To Earth" is poorly acted, and poorly directed
Not that I dislike childrens movies, but this was a tearjerker with few redeeming qualities
Fox was the perfect voice for Stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted
Hugh Laurie can be amazingly funny, but is not given the chance in this movie
It´s sugar-coated sugar and would hardly appeal to anyone over 7 years of age
At the name of Pinter, every knee shall bow - especially after his Nobel Literature Prize acceptance speech which did little more than regurgitate canned, by-the-numbers, sixth-form anti-Americanism
But this is even worse; not only is it a tour-de-force of talentlessness, a superb example of how to get away with coasting on your decades-old reputation, but it also represents the butchery of a superb piece
The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind
Yes, it was a theatrical confection, and it is easy to see how it's central plot device would work better on the stage than the screen, but it still worked terrifically well
This is a Michael Caine vanity piece, but let's face it, Caine is no Olivier
Not only can he not fill Larry's shoes, he couldn't even fill his bathroom slippers
The appropriately-named Caine is, after all, a distinctly average actor, whose only real recommendation, like so many British actors, is their longevity in the business
He was a good Harry Palmer, excellent in Get Carter, but that's yer lot, mate! Give this a very wide berth and stick to the superb original
but i thought it was bad funny, which means that it did have some redeeming qualities
there was more or less no plot, the characters were all stupid, and the movie was preachy
there were some places were i thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence, which would have hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder
i can't even believe that there are like 20 other people who have seen this movie
yeah, it's worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie, or at least can try to
Shows by and by what a crappy actor abhishek is and is only getting movies because of his dad and his wife
Ajay Devgan as always is shitty and useless and the new guy is a joke
The leading lady is such a waste of an actor
Such pathetic movie from such a revered director and from such a big industry
With movies as such I have decreased the amount of bollywood movies I watch
<br /><br />RGV has been making very crappy movies for a while now
Hrithek anyone? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol back
Every other leading lady is a half-naked wanna be
Sexo Cannibal, or Devil Hunter as it's more commonly known amongst English speaking audiences, starts with actress & model Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner as Ursula Fellner) checking out locations for her new film along with her assistant Jane (Gisela Hahn)
After a long days work Laura is relaxing in the bath of her room when two very dubious character's named Chris (Werner Pochath) & Thomas (Antonio Mayans) burst in & kidnap her having been helped by the treacherous Jane
Laura's agent gets on the blower to rent-a-hero Peter Weston (Al Cliver) who is informed of the situation, the kidnappers have Laura on an isolated island & are demanding a 6 million ransom
Peter is told that he will be paid 200,000 to get her back safely & a further 10% of the 6 million if he brings that back as well, faster than a rat up a drain pipe Peter & his Vietnam Vet buddy helicopter pilot Jack are on the island & deciding on how to save Laura
So, the kidnappers have Laura & Peter has the 6 million but neither want to hand them over that much
Just to complicate things further this particular isolated island is home to a primitive tribe (hell, in all the generations they've lived there they've only managed to build one straw hut, now that's primitive) who worship some cannibal monster dude (Burt Altman) with bulging eyes as a God with human sacrifices & this cannibal has a liking for young, white female flesh & intestines
<br /><br />This Spanish, French & German co-production was co-written & directed by the prolific Jesus Franco who also gets the credit for the music as well
Sexo Cannibal has gained a certain amount of notoriety here in the UK as it was placed on the 'Video Nasties' list in the early 80's under it's alternate Devil Hunter title & therefore officially classed as obscene & banned, having said that I have no idea why as it is one bad film & even Franco, who isn't afraid to be associated with a turkey, decides he wants to hide under the pseudonym of Clifford Brown
I'd imagine even the most die-hard Franco fan would have a hard time defending this thing
The script by Franco, erm sorry I mean Clifford Brown & Julian Esteban as Julius Valery who was obviously another one less than impressed with the finished product & wanted his named removed, is awful
It's as simple & straight forward as that
For a start the film is so boring it's untrue, the kidnap plot is one of the dullest I've ever seen without the slightest bit of tension or excitement involved & the horror side of things don't improve as we get a big black guy with stupid looking over-sized bloodshot eyes plus two tame cannibal scenes
As a horror film Sexo Cannibal fails & as an action adventure it has no more success, this is one to avoid
<br /><br />Director Franco shows his usual incompetence throughout, a decapitated head is achieved by an actor lying on the ground with large leaves placed around the bottom of his neck to try & give the impression it's not attached to anything! The cannibal scenes are poor, the action is lame & it has endless scenes of people randomly walking around the jungle getting from 'A' to 'B' & not really doing anything when they get there either
It becomes incredibly dull & tedious to watch after about 10 minutes & don't forget this thing goes on for 94 minutes in it's uncut state
I also must mention the hilarious scene when Al Cliver is supposed to be climbing a cliff, this is achieved by Franco turning his camera on it's side & having Cliver crawl along the floor! Just look at the way his coat hangs & the way he never grabs onto to anything as he just pulls himself along! The gore isn't that great & as far as Euro cannibal films go this is very tame, there are some gross close ups of the cannibals mouth as it chews bits of meat, a man is impaled on spikes, there's some blood & a handful of intestines
There's a fair bit of nudity in Sexo Cannibal & an unpleasant rape scene
<br /><br />Sexo Cannibal must have had a low budget & I mean low
This is a shoddy poorly made film with awful special effects & rock bottom production values
The only decent thing about it is the jungle setting which at least looks authentic
The music sucks & sound effects become annoying as there is lots of heavy breathing whenever the cannibal is on screen
The acting sucks, the whole thing was obviously dubbed anyway but no one in this thing can act
<br /><br />Sexo Cannibal is a terrible film that commits the fatal mistake of being as boring as hell
The only good things I can say is that it has a certain sleazy atmosphere to it & those close ups of the cannibal chewing meat are pretty gross
Anyone looking for a decent cinematic experience should give Sexo Cannibal as wide a berth as possible, one to avoid
Poorly structured, badly written, loaded with cliches and flat dialogue
The actors struggle with a painfully dull scenario that manages to completely avoid any surprises, plot twists or conflict
You know from the first ten minutes where it's going
<br /><br />For a movie set in NY, it has almost no feeling for the city
There are a dozen other indie movies that manage to make it seem magical on a small budget
This one seems like it was shot in Toronto
<br /><br />If you cast Natasha Henstridge, why dress her in baggy sweaters? Why make Vartan look boring and drab? Where's the attraction? I felt like I was watching a sub-par Christian movie of the week it was so asexual and moralizing
<br /><br />Steven Feder's big success is that he convinced people to make this bland movie
I can't even believe that this show lasted as long as it did
I guess it's all part of the dumbing down of America
Personally, like David Spade said, I liked this show better when it went by its original title - "Seinfeld"
What bothers me the most about this show, aside from the obvious, base sense of "humor", and general smuttiness, is the pretentious way the episodes are titled
Truly great shows are still funny after many, repeated viewings, like, "the one where Rob gets accidentally hypnotized", on the "Dick Van Dyke Show", or "the one where Lucy and Ethel work at the candy factory
" In other words, it's an honor bestowed upon great programs by the viewers
That the writers and producers of "Friends" would have the unmitigated hubris to actually title the episodes, themselves, in such a fashion, before anyone's even had a chance to even see it a second time, speaks to not only the mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of said writers, but, also, of the stultified minds of their viewers
<br /><br />You read the comments of some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a Hallmark Card-like Neverland, full of greeting card sentiment
The true meaning of friendship? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Wake Up
These people are supposed to be working in coffee shops and looking for work as actors, but they somehow manage to live in $4000/mo
All I have to say to those amongst us that want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic New York life with your Rosses and Monicas, good luck with all of that
That New York doesn't exist for anyone making less than a serious six-figure income
Something about a heatwave in some European country, complete trash
There's nothing going for this movie whatsoever
There is a very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off
This movie is complete rash and you shouldn't subject yourself to watching it
No body in their right mind should see this
i'm sure you'll regret it completely i did
How could they think up something this bad
The characters in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored
REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES (2 outta 5 stars) No, this is not a long-lost ancestor to the classic George A
This is a low-budget potboiler from 1936 that probably seemed very cool to audiences of the time
There is actually a pretty good scene at the start of a soldier firing off his pistol into a horde of approaching zombie soldiers
and a close-up of bullets entering the bare chest of one of them
The effect looks hopelessly fake these days but in 1936 I'm sure it had audiences gasping
The story concerns the search for the secret of mind control
ostensibly to create an unstoppable zombie army
but later as a means for one character to win the woman he loves
The movie is barely an hour long but moves at a snail's pace so it seems feature-length, believe me! There really isn't much to recommend it
you may get some amusement from the faked studio shots of the star "wading" through a "swamp"
so I'd say the movie is worth seeing at least once
More than likely you will see it as an extra feature on some cheap "4 movies on 1 DVD" compilation at Wal-Mart for five bucks
